\paragraph{Dedication:}
\label{sec:dedication}
This book is dedicated first and foremost to the people who made
Eclipse Phase happen, from everyone who contributed time, sweat,
ideas, and money into it to everyone who picks it up, reads it, and
plays it. This game is by you and for you.  Secondly it's dedicated to
my grandmother and to Andrea, both important people in my life who
died while I was working on this book and its themes of defeating
death. I sincerely hope that one day such tragic losses are
avoided. Third, this book is dedicated to my son Echo, my entertaining
working companion on this project. Finally this book is dedicated to
those visionaries, especially the anarchists and transhumanists, who
are working to bring about a fantastic future, starting now. —Rob
Boyle
