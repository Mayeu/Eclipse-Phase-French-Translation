% \chapter{Character creation}
% \label{chap:character-creation}


%  The first step towards playing Eclipse Phase is to
%  define your character. If you’re new to the game and
%  setting, the easiest way to jump right in is to simply
%  select one of the Sample Characters provided on pp.
%  154–169. If you’re more familiar with RPGs, or you
%  simply want finer control over your character, you
%  can build them from scratch, perhaps using one of the
%  Sample Characters as a template. This chapter will
%  walk you through the process of character genera-
%  tion, from the general concept and personality to the
%  crunchy game statistics.



%  CHARACTER GENERATION
%  There are two parts to every player character. The
%  first is the sets of numbers and attributes that define
%  what a character is good or bad at (or even what they
%  can and can’t do) according to the game mechanics.
%  These are more than just statistics, however—these
%  characteristics help to define your character’s abili-
%  ties and interests, and by extension their background,
%  education, training, and experience. During the
%  character creation process, you will have the ability
%  to assign, adjust, and juggle these characteristics as
%  you like. If you have a pre-conceived notion of what
%  the character is about, you can optimize the stats to
%  reflect that. Alternatively, you can tweak the stats until
%  you get something you like, then base the character’s
%  backstory off of what you develop.

%  The second part to every player character is their
%  personality. What defines them as a person? What
%  makes them tick? What pisses them off? What sparks
%  their interest? What positive aspects of their person-
%  ality make them appealing as a friend, comrade, or
%  lover—or at least someone interesting to play? What
%  character flaws and quirks do they have? These ques-
%  tions matter because they will also guide you as you
%  assign stats, skills, and traits.

%  Character generation is a step-by-step process.
%  Unlike some games, the process for creating an Eclipse
%  Phase character is not random—you have complete
%  control over every aspect of your character’s design.
%  Some stages must be completed before you can move
%  on to others. The complete process is broken down
%  on the Step-By-Step Guide to Character Creation
%  sidebar.

%  CHARACTER CONCEPT
%  Deciding what/who you want to play before you make
%  the character is usually the best route. Pick a simple
%  archetype that fits your character, and work from there.
%  Do you want to play an explorer? Someone sneaky,
%  like a spy or thief? Someone cerebral, like a scientist?
%  A hardened criminal or ex-cop? Or do you prefer to
%  be a rabble-rousing agitator? You can also start with a
% CHARACTER CREATION AND ADVANCE

%  personality type and choose an associated profession. If
%  you want a social butterfly who excels at manipulating
%  people, you can play a media personality, blogger, or
%  party-going socialite. Perhaps you’d prefer a bottomed-
%  out reject with substance abuse problems, in which
%  case an ex-merc or former hypercapitalist who lost
%  his fortune and family during the Fall might fit. How
%  about an energetic, live-life-to-the-fullest, must-see-it-
%  all character? Then a habitat freerunner or professional
%  gatecrasher might be what you’re looking for.

%  Make sure to check in with the other players and
%  try to create a character that’s complementary to the
%  rest of the team—preferably one who provides some
%  skill-set the group lacks. Why create a research arche-
%  ologist if someone else is already set on playing one,
%  especially when the team lacks a good combat special-
%  ist or async? On the other hand, if your team is going
%  to be running an alien archeological expedition, then
%  having more than one researcher (each with distinct
%  areas of expertise) might not be bad.

%  Once you have the basic concept, try to fill it with
%  a few more details, making it into a one-sentence

% %%% txt/133.txt
% summary. If you started with the concept of “xeno-so-
% ciologist,” expand it to “open-minded amateur linguist
% and expert xeno-sociologist who is fascinated by alien
% cultures, collects Factor kitsch, has a high-tolerance
% for ‘yuck factors,’ and whose best friends tend to be
% uplifts and AIs.” This will give you a few more details
% around which you can focus the character’s strengths
% and weaknesses.

% CHOOSE BACKGROUND
% The first step to creating your character is to choose a
% background. Was your character born on Earth before
% the Fall? Were they raised on a habitat commune? Or
% did they start existence as a disembodied AI?

% You must choose one of the backgrounds for your
% character from the list below. Choose wisely, as each
% background may provide your character with certain
% skills, traits, limitations, or other characteristics to
% start with. Keep in mind that your background is
% where you came from, not who you are now. It is
% the past, whereas your faction represents whom your
% character is currently aligned with. Your future, of
% course, is yours to make.

% The background options presented below cover a
% wide selection of transhumanity, but they cannot cover
% every possibility. If your gamemaster allows it, you
% may work with them to develop a background that is
% not included on this list, using these as guidelines to
% keep it balanced.

% DRIFTER
% You were raised with a social grouping that remained
% on the move throughout the Sol system. This could
% have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers, scav-
% engers, or just migrant workers. You are used to roam-
% ing space travel between habitats and stations.
% Advantages: +10 Navigation skill, +20 Pilot: Spacecraft

% skill, +10 Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
% Disadvantages: None
% Common Morphs: All, especially Bouncers and

% Hibernoids

% FALL EVACUEE
% You were born and raised on Earth and evacuated
% during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life
% (and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones)
% behind you. You were lucky enough to survive with
% your body intact and continue to make a life for your-
% self out in the system.
% Advantages: +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 Net-

% working: [Field] skill of your choice, +1 Moxie
% Disadvantages: Only 2,500 Starting Credit (can still

% buy credit with CP)
% Common Morphs: Flats, Splicers

% HYPERELITE
% You are privileged to have been raised as part of the
% immortal upper class that rules many inner system
% habitats and hypercorps. You were pampered with
% wealth and influence that most people can only
% dream of.
% Advantages: +10 Protocol skill, +10,000 Credit, +20

% Networking: Hypercorps skill
% Disadvantages: May not start with flat, splicer, or any

% pod, uplift, or synthetic morphs
% Common Morphs: Exalts, Sylphs

% INFOLIFE
% You entered existence as a digital consciousness—
% an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Your very
% existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of
% those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs).
% Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your
% capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you
% do have full autonomy.
% Advantages: +30 Interfacing skill, Computer skills (In-

% fosec, Interfacing, Programming, Research) bought

% with Customization Points are half price
% Disadvantages: Real World Naiveté trait, Social Stigma

% (AGI) trait, may not purchase Psi trait, Social skills

% bought with Customization Points are double price
% Common Morphs: Infomorphs, synthetic morphs

% ISOLATE
% You were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on
% the fringes of the system. Whether raised as part of
% a religious group, cult, social experiment, anti-tech
% cell, or a group that just wanted to be isolated, you
% spent most if not all of your upbringing isolated
% from other factions.
% Advantages: +20 to two skills of your choice
% Disadvantages: –10 starting Rep
% Common Morphs: All

% LOST
% You are a legacy of one of the most infamous debacles
% since the Fall. As a member of the “Lost generation,”
% you went through an accelerated-growth childhood,
% somehow surviving where others of your kind died,
% went insane, or were persecuted (see The Lost, p. 233).
% Your background is a social stigma, but it does provide
% you with certain advantages ... and burdens.
% Advantages: +20 to two Knowledge skills of your

% choice, Psi trait
% Disadvantages: Mental Disorder (choose two) trait,

% Social Stigma (Lost) trait, must start with Futura

% morph
% Common Morphs: Futuras

% LUNAR COLONIST
% You experienced your childhood in one of the cramped
% dome cities or underground stations on Luna, Earth’s
% moon. You had a ringside seat to the Fall of Earth.

% Common Morphs: Flats, Splicers, and Rusters

% ORIGINAL SPACE COLONIST
% You, or your parents, were part of the first “gen-
% erations” of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to
% stake a claim in space, so you are familiar with the
% cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older
% stations and habitats. As a “zero-one G” (zero-gravity,
% first-gen), you were never part of the elite. People from
% your background typically have some sort of special-
% ized tech training as vacworkers or habtechs.

% [Field] skill of your choice
% Disadvantages: None
% Common Morphs: All. Use of exotic morphs is

% common.

% RE-INSTANTIATED
% You were born and raised on Earth, but you did not
% survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body
% died there, but your backup was transmitted off-world,
% and you were one of the lucky few to be re-instantiated
% with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead
% storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave.

% Disadvantages: Edited Memories trait, 0 Starting

% UPLIFT
% You are not even human. You were born as an uplifted
% animal: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, parrot, raven,
% crow, or octopus.

% to two Knowledge skills of your choice
% Disadvantages: Must choose an uplift morph to start
% Common Morphs: Neo-Avian, Neo-Hominid,

% Octomorph
% CHOOSE FACTION
% After choosing your background, you now choose
% which primary faction your character belongs to.
% This faction most likely represents the grouping that
% controls your character’s current home habitat/station,
% and to which your character holds allegiance, but this
% need not be the case. You may be a dissident member
% of your faction, living among them but opposing some
% (or all) of their core memes and perhaps agitating for
% change. Whatever the case, your faction defines how
% your character represents themself in the struggle be-
% tween ideologies post-Fall.

% You must choose one of the factions listed below.
% Like your character’s background, it will provide your
% character with certain skills, traits, limitations, or
% other characteristics.

% The factions presented here outline the most numer-
% ous and influential among transhumanity, but others
% may also exist. At your gamemaster’s discretion, you
% may develop another starting faction with them not
% included on this list.

% ANARCHIST
% You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of
% social organization and directly democratic decision-
% making. You believe power is always corrupting and
% everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect
% their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive
% policies of the Inner system and Jovian Junta, this
% makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a ter-
% rorist at worst. In your opinion, that’s comedy coming
% from governments that keep their populations in line
% with economic oppression and threats of violence.

% Disadvantages: None
% Common Morphs: All

% ARGONAUT
% You are part of a scientific techno-progressive move-
% ment that seeks to solve transhumanity’s injustices and
% inequalities with technology. You support universal
% access to technology and healthcare, open source
% models of production, morphological freedom, and
% democratization. You try to avoid factionalism and
% divisive politics, seeing transhumanity’s splintering as
% a hindrance to its perpetuation.

% BRINKER
% You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of
% transhumanity and the various goings-on in the rest of
% system. Your particular grouping may have sought out
% imposed isolation, to pursue their own interests, or they
% have been exiled for their unpopular beliefs. Or you
% simply be a loner who prefers the vast emptiness of sp
% to socializing with others. You might be a religious culti

% in transhumanity.

% CRIMINAL
% You are involved with the crime-oriented underworld.
% may work with one of the Sol system’s major criminal

% JOVIAN
% Your faction is noted for its authoritarian regime, bio-
% conservative ideologies, and militaristic tendencies.
% Where you come from, technology is not to be trusted to
% everyone and humans need to be protected from them-

% You hail from Luna, the original off-Earth colony

% Your faction has no interest in co-opting their true

% to preserve and promote non-human life (or at least

% This is the future we’ve all been waiting for, and you’re

% faction embraces and revels in it. There is no more
% want, no more death, no more limits on what you can

% STARTING APTITUDES
% Your character receives 105 free points to distribute
% among their 7 aptitudes: Cognition, Coordination,
% Intuition, Reflexes, Savvy, Somatics, and Willpower
% (see Aptitudes, p. 123). (That breaks down to an aver-
% age of 15 per aptitude, so it may be easiest to give
% each 15 and then adjust accordingly, raising some and
% lowering others.) Each aptitude must be given at least
% 5 points (unless you take the Feeble trait, see p. 149),
% and no aptitude may be raised higher than 30 (unless
% you take the Exceptional Aptitude trait, p. 146). Note
% that certain morphs (flats and splicers, for example)
% may also put a cap on how high your aptitudes may
% be (see Aptitude Maximums, p. 124).

% For simplicity, it is recommended that aptitude
% scores be handled as multiples of 5, but this is not a
% necessity.

% NATIVE TONGUE
% Every character receives their natural Language skill
% at a rating of 70 + INT for free. This skill may be
% raised with CP (see below).

% STARTING MOXIE
% Every character starts off with a Moxie stat of 1 (see
% Moxie, p. 122).

% CREDIT
% All characters are given 5,000 credits with which to
% purchase gear during character creation, unless you
% have the Fall Evacuee or Re-instantiated background
% (in which case you start with 2,500 or 0 credits, re-
% spectively). See Purchasing Gear, p. 136, for more
% details.

% REP
% Your character isn’t a complete newbie. You get 50
% rep points to divide between the reputation networks
% of your choice (see Reputation and Social Networks,
% p. 285).

% SPEND CUSTOMIZATION POINTS
% Now that you have the basics of your character
% fleshed out, you can spend additional Customiza-
% tion Points (CP) to fine-tune your character. Each
% WIL to 10. She also wants to be smart and fast on her
% feet, so takes the extra 10 points that gives her and
% raises both COG and REF to 20. So her aptitudes are:

% She marks down her Moxie of 1 and gets her native
% language (Chinese) at 85, both for free.

% Noting her 5,000 Credits, Tai divides her Rep score
% points evenly among @-rep and c-rep, taking 25 in each.

% character is given 1,000 CP, which may be used to

% increase aptitudes, buy skills, acquire more Moxie,

% buy more credit, elevate your Rep, or purchase posi-

% tive traits. You may also take on negative traits in

% order to get even more CP with which to customize

% your character. This customization process should be

% used to tweak your character and specialize them in

% the ways you desire.


% If a gamemaster seeks a different level of gameplay,

% they can adjust this CP amount. If the gamemaster

% wants a scenario where the starting characters are

% younger or less experienced, they can lower the CP

% to 800 or even 700. On the other hand, if you want

% to create characters who start off as grizzled veterans,

% you can raise the CP to 1,100 or even 1,200.


% Not all customizations are equal—aptitudes, for ex-

% ample, are considerably more valuable than individual

% skills. To reflect this, CP must be spent at a specific

% ratio according to the specific boost desired.

%     1 CP = 1,000 credit


%     1 CP = 10 Rep


%    Trait and morph costs vary as noted.



% CUSTOMIZING APTITUDES

% Raising your aptitude score is quite expensive at 10

% CP per aptitude point. As noted above, no aptitude

% may be increased above 30. Keep in mind that your

% morph may also provide certain aptitude bonuses.


% INCREASING MOXIE

% Moxie may be raised at the cost of 15 CP per Moxie

% point. The maximum to which Moxie may be raised

% is 10.

% %%% txt/138.txt
% LEARNED SKILLS
% Each character must purchase a minimum of 400 skill
% points of Active skills and 300 skill points of Knowl-
% edge skills (see Skills, p. 170). Skills are bought at the
% cost of 1 CP per point. Keep in mind that learned
% skills start at the rating of the linked aptitude. For
% example, if you want to raise a skill to 30 and the
% skill’s linked aptitude is 10, you’ll need to spend 20 CP.
% Skill bonuses from background or faction should also
% be applied to the rating before you start raising the
% skill. For simplicity, it is recommended that skills be
% purchased as multiples of 5, but this is not a necessity.

% Raising a skill over 60 is expensive. Each point over
% 60 costs double. Raising a skill with a linked attribute
% of 20 up to 70 would cost 60 CP: 40 points to get from
% 20 to 60, and 20 more points to get from 60 to 70.

% No learned skill may be raised over 80 during char-
% acter creation (unless you have the Expert trait, p. 146).

% Though Knowledge skills are grouped into 5 skills,
% each is a field skill (p. 172), meaning that it can be
% taken multiple times with different fields.

% A complete list of skills can be found on p. 176.

% SPECIALIZATIONS
% Specializations (p. 173) may also be purchased at the
% cost of 5 CP per specialization. You may purchase
% specializations for both Active and Knowledge skills.
% Only 1 specialization may be purchased per skill, and
% they may only be bought for skills with a rating of
% 30+.

% BUYING MORE CREDIT
% If you want more cred to spend on gear, every CP will
% get you 1,000 credits. See Purchase Gear, p. 136, for
% details on buying stuff. The maximum CP you can
% spend on additional credits is 100.

% INCREASING REP
% If you want your character to start play with lots of
% social capital, you can increase your Rep score(s) at
% the cost of 1 CP per 10 additional points. No indi-
% vidual Rep score may be raised above 80, and the
% maximum amount of CP that may be spent on Rep
% is 35 points.

% STARTING MORPH
% Perhaps the most important use of CP is to buy the
% morph with which your character begins play. This
% may be the original bodily form in which your charac-
% ter started life, or it may simply be the sleeve they are
% currently inhabiting.

% Available morphs are listed starting on p. 139.

% Note that any aptitude or skill bonuses provided by
% the morph are applied after all CP are spent. In other
% words, these bonuses do not affect the costs of buying
% aptitude and skill points during character generation.
% No aptitude may be modified over 40.

% PURCHASING TRAITS
% Traits represent specific qualities your character has
% that may help or hinder them.

% Positive traits supply bonuses in certain situations,
% and each has a listed CP cost. You may not spend
% more than 50 CP on positive traits.

% Negative traits inflict disadvantages on your charac-
% ter, but they also give you extra CP that you can spend
% on customizing your character. You may not purchase
% more than 50 CP worth of negative traits, and no
% more than 25 CP may be negative morph traits.

% Positive traits are listed on p. 145, negative traits on
% p. 148. Note that traits you receive from your back-
% ground or faction do not cost or provide you with
% bonus CP.

% Traits listed as morph traits apply to the morph, and
% not the ego. If the character switches to a new morph,
% these traits are lost (and new morph traits may be
% gained). Morph traits may be bought like other traits
% during character generation.

% PSI SLEIGHTS
% Characters who purchase the Psi trait (p. 147) may
% spend CP to purchase sleights (see Sleights, p. 223).
% These represent specific psi abilities the character has
% learned. The cost to buy a sleight is 5 CP. No more

%        ➟ ➟ ➟ vExample continued from p. 135



%        Tai now has 1,000 points to customize. She wants to be


%        lucky, so she starts right off spending 60 (4 x 15) CP to


%        raise her Moxie from 1 to 5. She also decides that she


%        wants her character to be better at spotting things, so


%        she raises her INT from 15 to 20, at a cost of 50 CP (5 x


%        10). So far, she’s spent 110 CP.


%           She must buy at least 400 points of Active skills, so she


%        tackles that next. She knows that skills are based on apti-


%        tudes and they get more expensive over 60, so she decides


%        the most she’ll spend on any single skill is 40 (since her


%        highest aptitude is 20). She picks out her skills, assigns the


%        points, and adds them to the starting aptitudes.


%           This is what she starts with, noting the points she


%        spent on each and the total value (counting aptitude)


%        in parentheses.

% EXAMPLE






%           Beam Weapons (COO) 30 (45), Climbing (SOM) 30

%        Research (COG) 20 (40), and Scrounging (INT) 40 (60).


%           This costs her 450 CP, so she’s spent a total of 560


%        CP so far.


%           Now she spends her 300 points of Knowledge skills:

%  than 5 psi-chi and 5 psi-gamma sleights may be bought
%  during character creation.

%  Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from
%  sleights are treated as modifications; they are applied
%  after all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of
%  buying skills or aptitudes during character creation.

%  PURCHASE GEAR
%  No matter what faction you are from, you use Credit
%  to buy gear during character creation. A complete list
%  of gear and costs can be found in the Gear chapter, p.
%  294. The average costs for each cost category should
%  be used when calculating gear prices.




%                   GEAR COSTS
% CATEGORY           RANGE (CREDITS)            AVERAGE (CREDITS)
% Trivial                    1–99                          50
% Low                      100–499                        250
% Moderate                500–1,499                      1,000
% High                   1,500–9,999                     5,000
% Expensive                10,000+                      20,000

%  This costs her another 350 CP, bringing her total spent
% CP to 910.

%  Adding in her background and faction skills, she also
% has Networking: Autonomists (SAV) 30, Networking:
% Hypercorps (SAV) 30, Pilot: Spacecraft (REF) 30 (50),
% Pilot: Groundcraft (REF) 30 (50). She takes the freebie
% +10 and adds it to Fray (raising it to 60) and applies the
% other +10 to Academics: Economics (COG) 30.

%  With 90 CP left, Tai moves on to Rep. Tai wants to
% have a lot of good connections, so she raises both of her
% Rep scores by 30 points each, at a cost of 6 CP. She also
% decides she needs some credibility with criminal types,
% so she buys g-rep at 40, for 4 more CP. Now she has 80
% CP left.

%  Tai’s character needs a body, and she decides a


%                                                          EXAMPLE



% bouncer is most suited for the nomadic, spacefaring
% lifestyle of her brinker. That costs another 40 CP, leaving
% her with 50 CP left to spend.

%  Looking back at her skills, she decides to raise her
% Pilot: Spacecraft from 50 to 70. It costs her 10 CP to
% raise the skill to 60, and another 20 CP to raise it from
% 60 to 70, for a total cost of 30 CP. She also wants to
% raise her Scrounging from 60 to 70, for a 20 CP cost.
% That nicely uses up the last of her CP.

%  Scanning the traits, though, Tai also decides that
% Situational Awareness would be a good choice for her
% scavenger. At a cost of 10 CP, she would need to take an-
% other negative trait to compensate. She chooses Neural
% Damage (synaesthesia)—a condition she inherited from
% a rampaging nanovirus during the Fall.

%  Tai’s points are now all evened out and spent.






% Every character starts off with one piece of gear

% for free: a standard muse (p. 332). This is the digital

% AI companion that the character has had since they

% were a child. Additionally, each character starts with 1

% month of backup insurance (p. 330) at no cost.


% There is no limitation other than what the game-

% master allows on what gear characters can and cannot

% buy during character creation. Both the players and

% gamemaster should keep the character’s background

% and faction in mind. Since some gear is likely very

% restricted in some habitats if not outright illegal, there

% needs to be a plausible explanation for who and how

% a character from such a place might have such gear.

% If there isn’t, then the gamemaster can choose not to

% allow it. The starting locale for a game should also

% be considered. A character from the restrictive Jovian

% Republic might have a hard time explaining how they

% have an illegal cornucopia machine back in the Re-

% public, but if the game takes place on board a scum

% barge where everything is available and anything goes,

% then such an explanation becomes much easier.


% Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from gear

% are treated as modifications; they are applied after

% all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of buying

% skills or aptitudes during character creation.

% %%% txt/140.txt
% CHOOSE MOTIVATIONS
% The next step is to choose 3 personal motivations
%  for your character (see Motivations, p. 121). These
%  are memes, in the form of ideologies or goals, which
% your character is pursuing. These may be as specific
% “undermine the local triad boss” or as broad as “pro-
%  mote hypercapitalism,” and they may be short term
%  or long term. Some sample motivations are provided
%  on the Example Motivations table (p. 138). You
%  should work with your gamemaster when choosing
% your motivations, as they can be used to propel the
%  storyline forward and specific scenarios can be con-
%  structed around your character’s goals. Some of your
%  character’s motivations may change later (see Chang-
%  ing Motivation, p. 152). Motivations will help your
%  character regain Moxie (p. 122) and earn extra Rez
%  Points during gameplay (p. 384).

%  Motivations should be listed on your character
%  sheet as a single term or short phrase, along with a +
%  or – symbol to denote whether they support or oppose
%  it. For example, “+Fame” would indicate that your
%  character seeks to become a famous media personality,
%  whereas “–Reclaim Earth” means that your character
%  opposes the goal of reclaiming Earth.

% FINAL TOUCHES
% Now that you have everything settled, there are a few
% final steps.

% REMAINING STATS
% A few stats now need to be calculated and added to
% your character sheet:

%  • Lucidity (p. 122) equals your character’s WIL x 2.
%  • Trauma Threshold (p. 122) equals your LUC

% divided by 5 (round up).
%  • Insanity Rating (p. 122) equals LUC x 2.
%  • Initiative (p. 121) equals your character’s (REF +

% INT) x 2.
%  • Damage Bonus (p. 123) for melee equals SOM ÷

% 10 (round down).
%  • Death Rating (p. 122) equals DUR x

% 1.5 (biomorphs, round up) or DUR x 2

% (synthmorphs)
%  • Speed (p. 121) equals 1 (3 for infomorphs), modi-

% fied as appropriate by implants.

% %%% txt/141.txt
% DETAILING THE CHARACTER
% The final step in character creation is filling in the de-
% tails and figuring out what your character is like and
% what they are all about. Your character’s Background
% is a good place to start as it says where they came, but
% it could be expanded. What did they think of their
% childhood? Do they still have ties from there? How
% did they move from such origins to the Faction they
% are part of? Are they fully supportive of their Faction’s
% goals, or are they in opposition? How does the charac-
% ter view other Factions?

% Next, take a look at the skills and other defining
% points—these also tell a story. How did they acquire
% those skills? Why? How did they develop their Rep
% score (or lack of one)? How did they get connected
% with the groupings represented by their Networking
% skills? What do the character’s traits say about them?
% How did they get their current morph? Is it their
% original? If not, what happened to their first body?

% Also taking into account the major factor of Moti-
% vations, all of these questions will help you build a de-
% fining picture of your character. Not everything about
% your character needs to be filled out, of course—it’s
% ok to leave a few blanks that you can fill in later. As-
% sembling the points you have deduced so far will help
% you to present your character as a whole, unique indi-
% vidual, however, rather than just a blank template.

% As a final step, take a few minutes to pick out some
% specific identifying features and personality quirks that
% will help you define the character to others. This could
% be a way of talking, a strongly-projected attitude, a
% catchphrase they use frequently, a unique look or style
% of dress, a repetitive behavior, an annoying manner-
% ism, or anything else similar that is easy to latch onto.
% Such idiosyncrasies give something that other players
% can latch onto, spurring roleplaying opportunities.



% STARTING MORPHS
% Each morph has an associated CP cost. It also sup-
% plies the character’s Durability and Wound Threshold
% stats, and may modify Initiative, Speed, and certain
% aptitudes and learned skills. A credit cost is also listed,
% but this refers to the cost of buying such a morph in
% gameplay.

% Flexible Aptitude Bonuses: Some morphs have ap-
% titude bonuses that may be applied to an aptitude of
% the player’s choice. This reflects that not all morphs
% are created equal. When assigning these universal ap-
% titude bonuses, each boost must be applied to a sepa-
% rate aptitude; you may not elevate an aptitude that
% is already raised by that morph. Once an individual
% morph’s aptitude bonuses have been assigned, they
% are permanent for that morph (i.e., if another char-
% acter resleeves into that morph, the bonuses remain
% the same).

% BIOMORPHS
% Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (usually
% equipped with implants), birthed naturally or in an
% exowomb, and grown to adulthood either naturally
% or at a slightly accelerated rate.

% FLATS
% Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all
% of the natural defects, hereditary diseases, and other
% genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly applies.
% Flats are increasingly rare—most died off with the rest
% of humanity during the Fall. Most new children are
% splicers—screened and genefixed at the least—except
% in habitats where flats are treated as second-class citi-
% zens and indentured labor.

% sizes are much larger than their non-uplifted cous-
% ins (to the size of a human child), with larger heads
% for their increased brain size. Numerous transgenic
% modifications have been made to their wings, allow-
% ing them to retain limited flight capabilities at 1 g,
% but giving them a more bat-like physiology so they
% can bend and fold better, and adding primitive digits
% for basic tool manipulation. Their toes are also more
% articulated and now accompanied with an opposable
% thumb. Neo-avians have adapted well to microgravity
% environments, and are favored for their small size and
% reduced resource use.

% PODS
% Pods (from “pod people”) are vat-grown, biological
% bodies with extremely undeveloped brains that are
% augmented with an implanted computer and cybernet-
% ics system. Though typically run by an AI, pods are
% socially unfavored in some stations, utilized in slave
% labor in others, and even illegal in some areas. Because
% pods underwent accelerated growth in their creation,
% and were mostly grown as separate parts and then


%                    assembled, their biological


%                 design includes some shortcuts


%             and limitations, offset with implants


%           and regular maintenance. They lack


%      reproductive capabilities. In many habitats,


%   their legal status is a hotly-contested issue.


%  Unless otherwise noted, pods are also consid-
%  ered biomorphs for all rules purposes.

% PLEASURE PODS
% Pleasure pods are exactly what they seem—faux
% humans designed purely for intimate entertainment
% purposes. Pleasure pods have extra nerve clusters in
% their erogenous zones, fine motor control over certain
% muscle groups, enhanced pheromones, sanitized me-
% tabolisms, and the genetics for purring. Naturally, they
% are crafted for good looks and charisma and enhanced
% in other areas as well. Pleasure pods are capable of
% switching their sex at will to male, female, hermaph-
% rodite, or neuter.

% SYNTHETIC MORPHS

% Synthetic morphs are completely artificial/robotic.
% They are usually operated by AIs or via remote con-
% trol, but the lack of available biomorphs after the
% Fall meant that many infugees resorted to resleeving
% in robotic shells, which were also cheaper, quicker to
% manufacture, and more widely available. Neverthe-
% less, synthmorphs are viewed with disdain in many
% habitats, an option that only the poor and desperate
% accept to be sleeved in. Synthetic morphs are not
% without with their advantages, however, and so are
% commonly used for menial labor, heavy labor, habitat
% construction, and security services.

% All synthmorphs have the following advantages:


% • Lack of Biological Functions. Synthmorphs need

%  not be bothered with trivialities like breathing,

%  eating, defecating, aging, sleeping, or any similar

%  minor but crucial aspects of biological life.

% • Pain Filter. Synthmorphs can filter out their

%  pain receptors, so that they are unhampered by

%  wounds or physical damage. This allows them

%  to ignore the –10 modifier from 1 wound (see

%  Wound Effects, p. 207), but they suffer –30 on

%  any tactile-based Perception Tests and will not

%  even notice they have been damaged unless they

%  succeed in a (modified) Perception Test.

% • Immunity to Shock Weapons. Synthmorphs have

%  no nervous system to disrupt, and their optical

%  electronics are carefully shielded from interfer-

%  ence. Shock attacks may temporarily disrupt their

%  wireless radio communications, however, for the

%  duration of the attack.

% • Environmental Durability. Synthmorphs are

%  built to withstand a wide range of environments,

%  from dusty Mars to the oceans of Europa to the

%  vacuum of space. They are unaffected by any but

%  the most extreme temperatures and atmospheric

%  pressures. Treat as Temperature Tolerance (p.

%  305) and Vacuum Sealing (p. 305).

% • Toughness. Synthetic shells are made to last—a

%  fact reflected in their higher Durability and built-


%   in Armor ratings. Their composition also makes


%   their physical strikes more damaging: apply a +2


%   DV modifier on unarmed attacks for human-sized


%   shells and larger.

% CASE
% Cases are extremely cheap, mass-produced robotic
% shells intended to provide an affordable remor-
% phing option for the millions of infugees created by
% the Fall. Though many varieties of case bot models
% exist, they are uniformly regarded as shoddy and
% inferior. Most case morphs are vaguely anthromor-
% phic, with a thin framework body, standing just
% shorter than an average human, and suffer from
% frequent malfunctions.

% SYNTH
% Synths are anthromorphic robotic shells (androids
% and gynoids). They are typically used for menial
% labor jobs where pods are not as good of an option.
% Cheaper than many other morphs, they are com-
% monly used for people who need a morph quickly
% and cheaply or simply on a transient basis. Though
% they look humanoid, synths are easily recognizable
% as non-biological unless they have the synthetic mask
% option (p. 311).

% spider or termite. They feature four pairs of 1.5-meter-
% long retractable arms/legs, capable of rotating around
% the axis of the body, with built-in hydraulics for
% propelling the bot with small leaps. The manipula-
% tor claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with
% extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating

% %%% txt/146.txt

% FLEXBOTS
% Designed for multi-purpose functions, flexbots can
% transform their shells to suit a range of situations
% and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen
% interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable
% of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multi-
% legged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others.
% Each module features its own sensor units and “bush
% robot” fractal-branching digits (each capable of break-
% ing into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale,
% allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot
% control computer is also distributed between modules.
% Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but
% multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass
% operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as
% demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics as-
% sembly, and so on.

% REAPER
% The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of
% biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleop-
% eration or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form
% is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a
% thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector thrust nozzles
% to maneuver in microgravity, and also takes advan-
% tage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance.
% Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods
% are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made
% of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon
% mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even
% to change shape and length. In gravity environments,
% the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs.
% Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and
% bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise
% eyebrows, if not get you arrested.

% SWARMANOID
% The swarmanoid is not a single shell per se, but rather
% a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic micro-
% drones. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling,
% rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter

% %%% txt/147.txt
% fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer and
% sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm.
% Though the swarm can “meld” together into a roughly

% TRAITS
% Unless otherwise noted, listed traits are ego traits.

% POSITIVE TRAITS
% Positive traits provide bonuses to the character in
% certain situations.

% ADAPTABILITY
% Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% Resleeving is a breeze for this character. They adjust
% to new morphs much more quickly than most other
% people. Apply a +10 modifier per level for Integration
% Tests and Alienation Tests (p. 272).

% ALLIES
% Cost: 30 CP

% The character is part of or has a relationship with
% some influential group that they can occasionally call
% on for support. For example, this could be their old
% gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers,
% a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social
% clique. The gamemaster and player should work out
% what the character’s relationship is with this group,
% and why the character can call on them for aid.
% Gamemaster’s should take care that these allies are
% not abused, such as calling on them more than once
% per game session. The character’s ties to this group
% are also a two-way street—they will be expected to
% perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a
% potential plot seed for scenarios).

% AMBIDEXTROUS
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character can use and manipulate objects
% equally well with both hands (they do not suffer the
% off-hand modifier, as noted on p. 193). If the char-
% acter has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles,
% etc), this trait may be applied to a limb other than
% the hand. This trait may be taken multiple times for
% multiple limbs.

% ANIMAL EMPATHY
% Cost: 5 CP

% The character has an instinctive feel for handling
% and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds.
% Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests
% or whenever the character makes a test to influence or
% interact with an animal.

% BRAVE
% Cost: 10 CP

% This character does not scare easily, and will face
% threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm with-
% out flinching. As a side effect, the character is not
% always the best at gauging risks, especially when it
% comes to factoring in danger to others. The charac-
% ter receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear
% or intimidation.

% COMMON SENSE
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character has an innate sense of judgment that
% cuts through other distractions and factors that might
% cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player
% may ask the gamemaster what choice they should
% make or what course of action they should take, and
% the gamemaster should give them solid advice based
% on what the character knows. Alternately, if the
% character is about to make a disastrous decision, the
% gamemaster can use the character’s free hint and warn
% the player they are making a mistake.

% DANGER SENSE
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character has an intuitive sixth sense that warns
% them of imminent threats. They receive a +10 modifier
% on Surprise Tests (p. 204).

% DIRECTION SENSE
% Cost: 5 CP

% Somehow the character always knows which way
% is up, north, etc., even when blinded. The character
% receives a +10 modifier for figuring out complex di-
% rections, reading maps, and remembering or retracing
% a path they have taken.

% %%% txt/148.txt
% EIDETIC MEMORY (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 CP

% Much like a computer, the character has perfect
% memory recall. They can remember anything they have
% sensed, often even from a single glance. This works the
% same as the eidetic memory implant (p. 301).

% EXCEPTIONAL APTITUDE
% Cost: 20 CP

% The character may raise one of their maximum
% aptitude up to 10 points over the normal aptitude cap
% (30 for flats, 35 for splicers, 40 for all others). Note
% that this trait just raises the maximum, it does not
% give the character more 10 aptitude points. This trait
% may be taken only once.

% EXPERT
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character is a legend in the use of one particular
% skill. The character may raise one learned skill over 80,
% to a maximum of 90, during character creation. This
% trait does not actually increase the skill, it just raises
% the maximum. This trait may only be taken once.

% FAST LEARNER
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character improves skills and learns new
% ones in half the time it normally takes (see Improv-
% ing Skills, p. 152).

% FIRST IMPRESSION
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character has a way of charming or otherwise
% making a good impression the first time they interact
% with someone. This innate social lubricant allows them
% to more readily deal with new contacts and slip right
% into new social environments. Apply a +10 modifier
% on social skill tests when the character is interacting
% with another character for the first time only.

% HYPER LINGUIST
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character has an intuitive understanding of
% linguistic structures that facilitates learning new
% languages easily. The character requires one-third the
% normal amount of time and experience to learn any
% language (see Improving Skills, p. 152). The character
% can also learn any human language in one day simply
% by constant immersive exposure to it. Additionally,
% the character receives a +10 modifier when attempting
% to interpret languages they don’t know.

% IMPROVED IMMUNE SYSTEM (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% The morph’s immune system is robust and more
% resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins—even more
% than basic bio-mods. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier
% whenever making a test to resist infection or the ef-
% fects of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modi-
% fier to +20. This trait is only available to biomorphs.
% INNOCUOUS (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 CP

% In an age when exotic appearances and good looks
% are commonplace, the morph’s look is surprisingly
% bland and undistinguished, in that cookie cutter sort of
% way. The character’s physical looks are so mundane that
% others have a hard time picking them out of a crowd,
% describing their appearance, or otherwise remember-
% ing physical details. Apply a –10 modifier to all tests
% made to spot, describe, or remember the character. This
% modifier does not apply to psi or mesh searches.

% LIMBER (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% The morph is especially flexible and supple, capable
% of graceful contortions and interesting positions. At
% Level 1, the character can smoke with their toes, do the
% splits, and squeeze into small, cramped spaces. At Level
% 2, they are double-jointed escape artists. Each level pro-
% vides a +10 modifier to escaping from bonds, fitting into
% narrow confines, and other acts relying on contortion or
% flexibility. This trait is only available to biomorphs.

% MATH WIZ
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character can perform any feat of calculation,
% including the most complex and advanced math-
% ematics, instantly and with great precision, with the
% same ease an unmodified human can add 2 + 3. The
% character can calculate odds with great precision, find
% correlations in numerical data, and perform similar
% tasks with great ease. Apply a +30 modifier on tests
% involving math calculations.

% NATURAL IMMUNITY (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 CP

% The morph has a natural immunity to a specific
% drug, disease, or toxin. When afflicted with that spe-
% cific chemical, poison, or pathogen, the character re-
% mains unaffected. At the gamemaster’s discretion, this
% immunity may not apply to certain agents. It may not
% be applied to nanodrugs or nanotoxins. This trait is
% only available to biomorphs.

% PAIN TOLERANCE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% The character has a high threshold for pain toler-
% ance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on
% their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them
% to ignore the –10 modifier from 1 wound. Level
% 2 allows them to ignore the –10 modifiers from 2
% wounds. This trait is only available for biomorphs.

% PATRON
% Cost: 30 CP

% The character has an influential person in their
% life who can be relied on for occasional support.
% This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a
% high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker
% with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon,

% %%% txt/149.txt
% this patron can pull strings on the character’s behalf,
% supply resources, introduce them to people they need
% to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player
% and gamemaster should work together to define ex-
% actly who this NPC is and what their relationship
% with the player character is. Specifically, the question
% of why this patron is supporting the character should
% be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies?
% the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters
% should be careful that this trait does not get abused.
% The patron should be an occasional help (probably
% no more than once per game session at most) but is
% not always at the character’s beck-and-call. If the
% character asks for too much, too often, they should
% find the patron’s support drying up. Additionally, the
% character may need to take action to maintain the
% relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the
% patron’s behalf. In fact, the character may only have
% their patronage because they are on-call or of use to
% the NPC in some way.

% PSI
% Cost: 20 CP (Level 1), 25 CP (Level 2)

% The character has been infected with the Watts-
% MacLeod strain of the Exsurgent virus, which altered
% their brain structure and opened the potential for their
% mind to enhance their cognitive abilities and read and
% manipulate the biological minds of others (see Psi,
% p. 220). The character may purchase and learn psi
% sleights (p. 223). At Level 1, the character may only
% use psi-chi sleights. At Level 2, the character may use
% both psi-chi and psi-gamma sleights.

% Though this trait is not very expensive, gamemasters
% should not allow it to be abused. There are a number
% of negative side effects to Watts-MacLeod infection,
% noted under Psi Drawbacks, p. 220.
% PSI CHAMELEON (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character’s mental state is naturally resistant to
% psi sensing. Apply a –10 modifier to any attempts to
% locate or detect the character via psi sleights.

% PSI DEFENSE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% The character’s mind is inherently resistant to
% mental attacks. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier to
% all defense tests made against psi attacks. At Level 2,
% apply a +20 modifier.

% RAPID HEALER (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 CP

% The morph recovers from damage more quickly.
% Reduce the timeframes for healing by half, as noted
% on the Healing table, p. 208. This trait is only avail-
% able to biomorphs.

% RIGHT AT HOME
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character chooses one type of morph (splicer,
% neo-hominid, case, etc.). The character always
% feels right at home in morphs of this type. When
% resleeving into this type of morph, the character au-
% tomatically adjusts to the new body, no Integration
% or Alienation Test needed, suffering no penalties and
% no mental stress.

% SECOND SKIN
% Cost: 15 CP

% If your character background or faction enforces a
% restriction on your starting morph (for example, up-
% lifts must start with an uplift morph), this trait allows
% you to ignore that restriction and purchase a starting
% morph of your choice.

% %%% txt/150.txt
% SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
% Cost: 10 CP

% The character is very good at maintaining con-
% tinuous partial awareness of the goings-on in their
% immediate environment. In game terms, they do not
% suffer the Distracted modifier on Perception Tests
% to notice things even when their attention is focused
% elsewhere, or when making Quick Perception Tests
% during combat.

% STRIKING LOOKS (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are
% both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however,
% possesses a physical look that can only be described as
% striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and
% fascinating—even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati
% take notice. On social skill tests where the character’s
% beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for
% Level 1) or +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This modifier
% is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the
% infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only avail-
% able to biomorphs.

% This modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs,
% but at half the cost, and it is only effective against
% characters with that specific uplift background (i.e.,
% neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).

% The one drawback to this trait is that the character
% is more easily noticed and remembered.

% TOUGH (MORPH TRAIT)
% Cost: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP

% This morph is resilient than others of its type and
% can take more physical abuse. Increase their Durabil-
% ity by +5 per level (+5 at Level 1, +10 at Level 2, and
% +15 at Level 3). This also increases Wound Threshold
% by +1, +2, and +3 respectively.

% ZOOSEMIOTICS
% Cost: 5

% A character with this trait and the Psi trait does
% not suffer a modifier when using psi sleights on non-
% sentient or partly-sentient animal species.

% NEGATIVE TRAITS

% Negative traits generally hinder the character and
% apply negative modifiers in certain circumstances.

% ADDICTION (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 5 CP (Minor), 10 CP (Moderate), or 20 CP

% (Major)

% Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting
% the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The
% character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317),
% stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that
% impacts the character’s physical or mental health.
% Players and gamemasters should work together to
% agree on addictions that are appropriate for their
% game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity:
% minor, moderate, or major:

% Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under
% control—it does not ruin the character’s life, though
% it may create some difficulties. The character may not
% even recognize or admit they have a problem. The
% character must indulge the addiction at least once
% a week, though they can go for longer without too
% much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose,
% they suffer a –10 modifier on all actions until they get
% their fix.

% Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing.
% The character obviously has a problem, and must
% satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail
% to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive
% behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until
% they indulge their craving. Apply a –20 modifier to
% all of the character’s actions until they get their fix.
% Additionally, a character with this level of addiction
% suffers a –5 DUR penalty.

% Major: A character with a major addiction is on
% the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6
% hours, and suffer a –10 DUR penalty as their health
% is affected. If they fail to get their regular dosage, they
% suffer a –30 modifier on all actions until they do. If
% their life hasn’t already been ruined by their obsession,
% it soon will be.

% AGED (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The morph is physically aged, and has not been
% rejuvenated. Old morphs are increasingly uncom-
% mon, though some people adopt them hoping to
% gain an air of seniority and respectability. Reduce
% the character’s aptitude maximums by 5, and apply
% a –10 modifier on all physical actions.

% This trait may only be applied to flat and splicer
% morphs.

% BAD LUCK
% Bonus: 30 CP

% Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence,
% things seem to go wrong around the character. The
% gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal
% to the character’s Moxie stat, which also refreshes
% at the same rate as the character’s Moxie. Only the
% gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and
% the purpose is to use it against the character. In other
% words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to
% cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a
% roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that fol-
% lows the character, the gamemaster can even use this
% bad Moxie against the character’s friends and allies,
% when they are doing something with or related to
% the character, though this should be used sparingly.
% Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the
% character should remember that the player asked for
% it by purchasing this trait.

% %%% txt/151.txt
% BLACKLISTED
% Bonus: 5 or 20 CP

% The character has managed to get themselves
% blacklisted in certain circles, whether they actually
% did something to deserve it or not. In game terms, the
% character is barred from having a Rep score higher
% than 0 in one particular reputation network. People
% within that network will refuse to help the character
% out of fear of reprisals and ruining their own reputa-
% tion. The bonus for this trait is 20 CP if chosen for the
% rep network pertaining to the character’s own starting
% faction, and 5 CP if chosen for any other.

% BLACK MARK
% Bonus: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2),

% or 30 (Level 3) CP

% At some point in the character’s past, they managed
% to do something that earned a black mark on their
% reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do,
% this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to
% haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character
% picks one faction. Every time they interact with this
% faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC
% from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who
% the character is, they suffer a –10 modifier per level.

% COMBAT PARALYSIS
% Bonus: 20 CP

% The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing
% in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in
% headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the
% character, or they are surprised, the character must
% make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in
% any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and
% simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to
% the situation.

% EDITED MEMORIES
% Bonus: 10 CP

% At some point in the character’s past, the charac-
% ter had certain memories strategically removed or
% otherwise lost to them. This may have been done to
% intentionally forget an unpleasant or shameful experi-
% ence or to make a break with the past. The memory
% may also have been lost by an unexpected death (with
% no recent backup), or it may have been erased against
% the character’s will. Whatever the case, the memory
% should bear some importance, and there should exist
% either evidence of what happened or NPCs who know
% the full story. This is a tool the gamemaster can use to
% haunt the character at some future point with ghosts
% from their past.

% ENEMY
% Bonus: 10 CP

% At some point in their past, the character made
% an enemy for life who continues to haunt them. The
% gamemaster and player should work out the details on
% this enmity, and the gamemaster should use the enemy
% as an occasional threat, surprise, and hindrance.
% FEEBLE
% Bonus: 20 CP

% The character is particularly weak with one aptitude.
% That aptitude must be purchased at a rating lower
% than 5, and may never be upgraded during character
% advancement. The aptitude maximum is 10, no matter
% what morph the character is wearing.

% FRAIL (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% This morph is not as resilient as others of its type.
% Its Durability is reduced by 5 per level. This also re-
% duces Wound Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively.

% GENETIC DEFECT (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP or 20 CP

% The morph is not genefixed, and in fact suffers
% from a genetic disorder or other impairing mutation.
% The player and gamemaster should agree on a defect
% appropriate to their game. Some possibilities include:
% heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell dis-
% ease, hypertension, hemophilia, or color blindness.
% A genetic disorder that creates minor complications
% and/or occasional health problems would be worth
% 10 CP, a defect that significantly impairs the charac-
% ter’s regular functioning or that inflicts chronic health
% problems is worth 20 CP. The gamemaster must de-
% termine the exact effects of the disorder on gameplay,
% as appropriate.

% This trait is only available for flats.

% IDENTITY CRISIS
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character’s ego has trouble adapting itself to
% the changed look of a new morph—they are stuck
% with the mental image of their original body, and
% simply do not grow accustomed to their new face(s).
% As a result, the character has difficulty identifying
% themselves in the mirror, photos, surveillance feeds,
% etc. They frequently forget the look and shape of their
% current morph, acting inappropriately, describing
% themselves by their original body, forgetting to duck
% when walking through doorways, etc. This is primar-
% ily a roleplaying trait, but the gamemaster may apply
% appropriate modifiers (usually –10) to tests affected
% by this inability to adapt.

% ILLITERATE
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character knows how to speak, but has diffi-
% culty reading or writing. Due to the entoptic-saturated
% and icon-driven nature of transhuman society, they are
% able to get by quite comfortably with this handicap.
% Reduce the character’s Language skills by half (round
% down) whenever reading or writing.

% IMMORTALITY BLUES
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character has lived so long—over 100 years—
% they’re bored with life and now have difficulty

% %%% txt/152.txt
% motivating themselves. They were old when longevity
% treatments first became available, survived the Fall,
% and continue to soldier onward—though they find
% it increasingly harder to care, take interest in things
% around them, or fear final death. The character only
% receives half the Moxie and Rez Points award for
% completing motivational goals.

% This trait may not be purchased by characters with
% the infolife or uplift backgrounds.

% IMPLANT REJECTION (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 5 (Level 1) or 15 (Level 2) CP

% This morph does not accept implants well. At Level
% 1, any implants acquired are more expensive as they
% required specialized anti-rejection treatments. Increase
% the Cost category of the implant by one. At Level 2,
% the morph cannot accept implants of any kind.

% INCOMPETENT
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character is completely incapable of perform-
% ing a particular chosen active skill, no matter any
% training they may receive. They may not buy this skill
% during character creation or later advancement, and
% the modifier for defaulting to the linked aptitude of
% this particular skill is –10. This may not be used for
% exotic weapon skills, and should be used for a skill
% that could be of use to the character.

% LEMON (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% This trait is only available for synthetic morphs.
% This particular morph has some unfixable flaws. Once
% per game session (preferably at a time that will maxi-
% mize drama or hilarity), the gamemaster can call for
% the character to make a MOX x 10 Test (using their
% current Moxie score). If the character fails, the morph
% immediately suffers 1 wound resulting from some me-
% chanical failure, electrical glitch, or other breakdown.
% This wound may be repaired as normal.

% LOW PAIN TOLERANCE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 20 CP

% Pain is the character’s enemy. The character has
% a very low threshold for pain tolerance and is more
% severely impaired when suffering. Increase the modi-
% fier for each wound take by an additional –10 (so
% the character suffers –20 with one wound, –40 with
% another, and –60 with a third). Additionally, the
% character suffers a –30 modifier on any test involving
% pain resistance. This morph version of this trait is only
% available for biomorphs.

% MENTAL DISORDER
% Bonus: 10 CP

% You have a psychological disorder from a previous
% traumatic experience in your life. Choose one of the
% disorders listed on p. 211.
% MILD ALLERGY (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 5 CP

% The morph is allergic to a specific chosen allergen
% (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain chemicals) and suf-
% fers mild discomfort when exposed to it (eye irritation,
% sneezing, difficult breathing). Apply a –10 modifier to
% all tests while the character remains exposed. This
% trait is only available for biomorphs.

% MODIFIED BEHAVIOR
% Bonus: 5 (Level 1), 10 (Level 2), or 20 (Level 3) CP

% The character has been conditioned via time-
% accelerated behavioral control psychosurgery. This is
% common among ex-felons, who have been conditioned
% to respond to a specific idea or activity with vehement
% horror and disgust, but may have occurred for some
% other reason or even been self-inflicted. At Level 1, the
% chosen behavior is either limited or boosted, at Level
% 2 it is either blocked or encouraged, and at Level 3 it
% is expunged or enforced (see p. 231 for details). This
% trait should only be allowed for behaviors that are
% either limited or, if encouraged, impact the character
% in a negative way.

% MORPHING DISORDER
% Cost: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP

% Adapting to new morphs is particularly challeng-
% ing for this character. The character suffers a –10
% modifier per level on Integration Tests and Alien-
% ation Tests (p. 272).

% NEURAL DAMAGE
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character has suffered some type of neurologi-
% cal damage that simply cannot be cured. The affliction
% is now part of the character’s ego and remains with
% them even when remorphing. This damage may have
% been inherited, it may have resulted from a poorly de-
% signed morph or implant, or it may have been inflicted
% by one of the TITAN nanovirii that targeted neural
% systems during the Fall (p. 384). The gamemaster and
% player should agree on a specific disorder appropriate
% to their game. Some possibilities are:

%  • Partial aphasia (difficulty communicating or

% using words)
%  • Color blindness
%  • Amusica (inability to make or understand music)
%  • Synaesthesia
%  • Logorrhoea (excessive use of words)
%  • Loss of face recognition
%  • Loss of depth perception (double range

% modifiers)
%  • Repetitive behavior
%  • Mood swings
%  • The inability to shift attention quickly


% The gamemaster may decide to inflict modifiers
% resulting from this affliction as appropriate.

% %%% txt/153.txt
% NO CORTICAL STACK (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The morph lacks the cortical stack that is common
% to morphs of its type. This means the character cannot
% be resleeved from the cortical stack if the character
% dies, they can only be resleeved from a standard
% backup. This trait is not available for flats.

% OBLIVIOUS
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character is particularly oblivious to events
% around them or anything other than what their at-
% tention is focused on. They suffer a –10 modifier
% to Surprise Tests and their modifier for being Dis-
% tracted is –30 rather than the usual –20 (see Basic
% Perception, p. 190).

% ON THE RUN
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character is wanted by the authorities of a
% particular habitat/station or faction, who continue to
% actively search for the character. They either commit-
% ted a crime or somehow displeased someone in power.
% The character deals with that faction in question at
% their own risk, and may occasionally be forced to deal
% with bounty hunters.

% PSI VULNERABILITY (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% Something about the character’s mind makes
% them particularly vulnerable to psi attack. They
% suffer a –10 modifier when resisting such attacks.
% The morph version of this trait may only be taken
% by biomorphs.

% REAL WORLD NAIVETÉ
% Bonus: 10 CP

% Due to their background, the character has very
% limited personal experience with the real (physical)
% world—or they have spent so much time in simul-
% space that their functioning in real life is impaired.
% They lack an understanding of many physical proper-
% ties, social cues, and other factors that people with
% standard human upbringings take for granted. This
% lack of common sense may lead the character to
% misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret
% someone’s body language.

% Once per game session, the gamemaster may in-
% tentionally mislead the character when giving them
% a description about some thing or some social in-
% teraction. This falsehood represents the character’s
% misunderstanding of the situation, and should be
% roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes
% the character’s mistake.

% This trait should only be available to characters
% with the infolife or reinstantiated backgrounds,
% though the gamemaster may allow it for characters
% who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their
% personal histories.
% SEVERE ALLERGY (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 (uncommon) or 20 (common) CP

% The morph’s biochemistry suffers a severe allergic
% reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into contact
% (touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen.
% The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen,
% certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect
% stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an
% allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen,
% the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breath-
% ing (–30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR
% Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory
% failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied).
% This trait is only available to biomorphs.

% SLOW LEARNER
% Bonus: 10 CP

% New skills are not easy for this character to pick
% up. The character takes twice as long as normal to
% improve skills or learn new ones (p. 152).

% SOCIAL STIGMA (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% An unfortunate aspect of the character’s back-
% ground means that they suffer from a stigma in
% certain social situations. They may be sleeved in
% a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of
% the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in
% a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelli-
% gence. In social situations where the character’s nature
% is known to someone who view that nature with dis-
% taste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a –10 to –30
% modifier (gamemaster’s discretion) to social skill tests.

% TIMID
% Bonus: 10 CP
%  This character frightens easily. They suffer a –10
% modifier when resisting fear or intimidation.

% UNATTRACTIVE (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)

% In a time when good looks are easily purchased,
% this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness
% is increasingly associated with being poor, backward,
% or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good
% looks range from distaste to horror. The character suf-
% fers a –10 modifier on social tests for Level 1, –20 for
% Level 2, and –30 for Level 3.

% Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modifier
% does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or
% those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This
% modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but at
% half the bonus, and it is only effective against char-
% acters with that specific uplift background (i.e., neo-
% avians, neo-hominids, etc.).

% UNCANNY VALLEY (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% There is a point where synthetic human looks
% become uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but

% %%% txt/154.txt
% they remain just different enough that their looks
% seem creepy or even repulsive—a phenomenon called
% the “uncanny valley.” Morphs whose looks fall into
% this range suffer a –10 modifier on social skill tests
% when dealing with humans. This modifier does not
% apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with
% the infolife or uplift backgrounds.

% UNFIT (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2)

% The morph is either not optimized for health and/or
% just in bad shape. Reduce the aptitude maximums for
% Coordination, Reflexes, and Somatics by 5 (Level 1 )
% or 10 (Level 2).

% VR VERTIGO
% Bonus: 10 CP

% The character experiences intense vertigo and
% nausea when interfacing with any type of virtual real-
% ity, XP, or simulspace. Augmented reality has no effect,
% but VR inflicts a –30 modifier to all of the character’s
% actions. Prolonged use of VR (gamemaster’s discre-
% tion) may actually incapacitate the character should
% they fail a WIL x 2 Test.

% WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

% The morph’s immune system is susceptible to diseas-
%  es, drugs, and toxins. At Level 1, apply a –10 modifier
% whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects
% of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modifier to
% –20. This trait is only available to biomorphs.

% ZERO-G NAUSEA (MORPH TRAIT)
% Bonus: 10 CP

% This morph suffers from space sickness and does
% not fair well in zero-gravity. The character suffers a
% –10 modifier in any microgravity climate. Addition-
% ally, whenever the character is first getting acclimated
% or anytime they must endure excessive movement in
% microgravity, they must make a WIL Test or spend 1
% hour incapacitated by nausea per 10 points of MoF.



% CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT
% As characters accomplish goals and gather experience
% during gameplay, they accumulate Rez Points (see
% Awarding Rez Points, p. 384). Rez Points may be used
% to improve the character’s skills, aptitudes, and other
% characteristics per the following rules. The costs for
% spending Rez Points for advancement are the same as
% the costs for spending Customization Points.

% CHANGING MOTIVATION
% It is only natural that over time a character’s driving
% goals and interests will change. The character may
% reach a turning point where they feel certain personal
% agendas have been fulfilled and it is time to move on,
% or they have failed and need to be discarded. New
% urgencies or philosophies may have entered the
% character’s life, or the character may have become
% disenchanted with particular memes and ideas they
% previously took to heart.

% Changing a character’s motivation does not cost
% Rez Points, but it is something that should only
% happen in accordance with roleplaying and with
% life-altering events. Players should not be allowed
% to simply switch their motivations at whim, there
% should be a driving reason or explanation for doing
% so. For this reason, changing a motivation should only
% happen when the player and gamemaster discuss the
% matter and both agree that the swap is appropriate to
% the character’s development and circumstances.

% If these conditions are met, the character simply
% drops a previously held motivation and takes on a
% new one. Only one motivation should be switched
% out at a time.

% SWITCHING MORPHS
% Resleeving—switching from one morph to another—
% is handled as an in-character interaction, not with Rez
% Points. See Resleeving, p. 271.

% IMPROVING APTITUDES
% Aptitudes may be raised with Rez Points at the cost of
% 10 RP per aptitude point. This represents the charac-
% ter’s improvement in their core characteristics, gained
% from exercise, learning, and experience. Aptitudes may
% not be raised above 30 (bonuses from morphs, im-
% plants, traits, or other sources do not count towards
% this total).

% Raising the value of an aptitude also raises the
% value of all linked skills by an equivalent amount. If
% this raises any linked skills over 60, an additional 1
% RP must be spent per linked skill over 60.

% IMPROVING SKILLS
% Characters may also spend Rez Points to increase
% existing skills or learn new ones. To improve an ex-
% isting skill, the character must have successfully used
% that skill in the recent past or must actively practice
% it in order to get better, perhaps with the aid of an
% instructor. In the case of Knowledge skills, this means
% actively studying. As a rough timeframe, this should
% require around 1 week of learning per skill point. A
% number of educational resources are freely available

% S
%  In a setting where physical looks and capabilities are
%  easily changed at the push of a button, who you are and
%  what you know is more important than any inborn abil-
%  ity. Skills represent the knowledge your character has,
%  the accumulated set of experience, education, and in-
%  herent know-how possessed by each and every sentient
%  transhuman in Eclipse Phase. They are what allow you
%  to sneak into a hypercorp station, disable the security
%  systems, hack the mesh hub, and then impersonate secu-
%  rity personnel to make your escape. Your skills represent
%  the one thing you have no matter what you look like or
%  where you find yourself. When your characters explore
%  what they can do, their skills, or lack thereof, often de-
%  termine the margin between success and failure.

%  Having a well-rounded set of skills is vital to survival
%  and success in Eclipse Phase. The skills below encompass
%  a wide selection of talents, enough so that each character
%  can be unique in their abilities and knowledge.



%  SKILLS OVERVIEW
%  Skills are divided into aptitudes and learned skills (see
%  Character Skills, p. 123). Most (but not all) learned
%  skills are built on and linked to an aptitude. If a
%  character lacks the specific skill needed in a situation,
%  they may default to the linked aptitude. You may also
%  choose to specialize in certain skills (see Specializa-
%  tions, p. 123), reflecting an enhanced knowledge of a
%  particular aspect of a certain skill.

%  CORE SKILLS: APTITUDES
%  Aptitudes represent inherent skills and abilities acquired
%  at birth or during the course of growing up. Aptitudes
%  are sometimes used for tests, but their primary use is
%  determining the starting point at which learned skills
%  are developed. Aptitudes determine the starting value
%  of their linked skills. For example, a character with
%  Somatics aptitude 10 who wishes to purchase points
%  in the Freerunning skill (which is linked to Somatics)
%  would start with a Freerunning rank of 10 and then
%  buy additionally points in that skill.

% Aptitudes are also used when a character doesn’t
%  posses knowledge of a needed skill (see Defaulting, p.
%  116). Aptitudes represent the basic knowledge that a
%  character has acquired regarding rudimentary use of that
%  skill. They may not have ever received any formal train-
%  ing with the skill, but they can still attempt to use it.

% Aptitudes range in value from 1 to 30, with 10 being
%  the unaugmented human average and 15 representing
%  the average of most genetically modified transhumans.
%  Since aptitudes represent untrained ability, they are
%  capped at a maximum rating of 30.

% There are seven different aptitudes that all players
%  possess. These aptitudes are purchased during charac-
%  ter creation (p. 128), but depending on the morph the

%  character is currently inhabiting, they may find their ap-
%  titudes capped by the quality of the morph (see p. 124).

%  LEARNED SKILLS
%  A player’s learned skills are the most important part of
%  their character, representing the acquired knowledge
%  they carry with them from morph to morph, knowl-
%  edge that plays a fundamental role in helping define
%  the person’s ego. Learned skills encompass nearly any
%  skill that you might need to use in Eclipse Phase, and
%  they range in value from 0 to 99.

% All learned skills have a linked aptitude that is
%  used to calculate their initial value, and which is
%  also defaulted to if the player does not have that
%  particular skill.

%  SKILL CATEGORIES
%  Each learned skill is classified as either an Active skill
%  or a Knowledge skill. Active skills represent skills
%  that typically require physical actions and are used in
%  action scenes within game play. Knowledge skills are
%  more knowledge-based and intellectual, representing
%  ideas and facts. Knowledge skills may play a less dra-
%  matic role in certain action-oriented game play mo-
%  ments, but they flesh out the character’s background
%  and interests and are integral to roleplaying interac-
%  tions. Active and Knowledge skills are purchased
%  separately during character creation.

% Active skills are further divided into Combat,
%  Mental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle
%  skills. Certain traits and abilities may apply to specific
%  categories.

%  FIELD SKILLS
%  Some learned skills are field skills, meaning that when
%  this skill is chosen a particular field of emphasis must
%  also be selected. For example, the skill of Academics
%  requires the character to specify a specific academic
%  discipline in which they are knowledgeable, such as
%  Biology, Chemistry, or Xenosociology. Field skills are
%  written as “[skill]: [field];” for example: “Art: Paint-
%  ing.” Field skills can be taken multiple times, choosing
%  a different area of emphasis each time, reflecting skills
%  in different fields; that is to say, each field is a separate
%  skill. Several suggested fields are listed for each field
%  skill, but gamemasters and players may also cooperate
%  to create others that fit their games.

%  Field skills may also have specializations; for exam-
%  ple, Professional: Accounting (Money Laundering).

%  PSI SKILLS
%  Psi refers to the ability to perceive and manipulate
%  biological minds via psi waves and/or other inexpli-
%  cable phenomena. Due to the uniqueness of this ability,
%  characters that wish to wield psi must acquire the Psi

% %%% txt/175.txt
% trait (p. 147). Psi use also requires a number of special-
% ized skills (Control, Psi Assault, and Sense) that reflect
% special training characters acquire to tap into their psi
% powers. Psi skills may not be defaulted on; the only
% way to use a psi skill is to possess the trait along with
% training in that skill. For more details, see Psi, p. 220.

% SPECIALIZATIONS
% Any character may opt to specialize in a given skill
% (see Specializations, p. 123). This specialization reflects
% increased knowledge in one particular aspect of the
% skill. Many of the skills offered below include sample
% specializations. Gamemasters and players are encour-
% aged to develop other specialization ideas together for
% their campaigns.

% Specialization provides a +10 modifier when
% using that skill in a situation appropriate to that
% specialization.



% USING SKILLS
% Whenever a character wants to do something using
% a skill, they must succeed at a skill test (see Making
% Tests, p. 115). The difficulty of the action is applied
% as a modifier, as are any other extenuating circum-
% stances that may affect the test (see Difficulty and
% Modifiers, p. 115). As with other types of tests, all skill
% tests are successful when the character rolls less than
% or equal to the test’s target number after any modi-
% fiers have been applied. In the case of skill tests, the
% target number is the character’s skill rating with that
% particular skill. Modifiers representing difficulty and
% other factors are applied directly to the target number
% (see Difficulty and Modifiers, p. 115). A roll of a 00 is
% always a success, regardless of modifiers, and a result
% of 99 is always a failure, again despite any modifiers
% that may increase a character’s target number over
% 100. Standard critical success and failure rules apply
% to skill tests (see Criticals: Rolling Doubles, p. 116),
% so any time a character rolls a double (i.e. 00, 11, 22,
% 33, etc.) they score a critical success or failure.

% DEFAULTING
% Sometimes you lack the skill needed in a certain situ-
% ation. In these instances, characters may default their
% skill test to the linked aptitude. This reflects the fact
% that most learned skills are developed from some sort
% of baseline physical ability. Even though you may not
% know how to do something, you’ve likely seen how
% it’s done at some point or have some idea of how to
% do it, or can at least take a shot at it. Naturally, you’re
% not as good as someone who has training in that skill,
% but it still allows you to make an attempt.

% Not all skills can be defaulted. Some skills are
% simply too complex or obscure, or demand special
% knowledge or ability, for someone to attempt their
% use untrained. For example, brain surgery or most psi
% skills are simply beyond anyone who doesn’t have that
% ability or the knowledge of what they’re attempting.
% DEFAULTING TO FIELD SKILLS
% In some cases, a character may not possess the par-
% ticular field skill that a test calls for, but they may be
% skilled in another related field. For example, a test to
% conduct an alien autopsy might call for an Academics:
% Xenobiology roll, but a character who doesn’t have
% that skill may be allowed to default to Academics:
% Biology instead. The gamemaster decides if and when
% to allow this, perhaps applying a modifier to the test
% based on the difference between fields.

% DEFAULTING TO RELATED SKILLS
% If the gamemaster allows it, characters may default to
% a related skill that also has some relevance to the test
% at hand. For example, a character skilled in Kinetic
% Weapons might not be trained in the use of a laser, but
% they know enough to point at the target and pull the
% trigger. Likewise, a character might not be skilled in
% Investigation, but the gamemaster could still allow
% them to use their Perception skill instead in order to
% realize that a body had been moved from the place
% where it had been shot. In situations like this, when the
% gamemaster allows defaulting to a related skill, a –30
% modifier should be applied to the test.



% Srit is wandering through a black market souk on

% Mars, trying to find a particular piece of sensory

% equipment. The gamemaster calls for a Scrounging


%                                                        EXAMPLE





% Test, but Srit does not have that skill. She could

% default her INT of 22, but instead she asks the

% gamemaster if she can default to the related skill

% of Perception, which she has at 82. The gamemas-

% ter agrees, and so Srit rolls against a target number

% of 52 (82 – 30).


% COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS
% Sometimes more than one skill may apply to a particu-
% lar test, or knowledge in one area can aid your skill
% in another. In this case, the gamemaster may apply a
% modifier to the skill test based on the strength of the
% complementing skill, as noted on the Complementary
% Skill Bonus table.

% particular isolates, he calls on his knowledge of their

% particular cultural practices (Interests: Religious

% Cults skill at 45). The gamemaster allows this and

% applies a +20 modifier to Dav’s Persuasion Test.

% SKILL RANGES

% What is the difference between being a clumsy neo-

% phyte wobbling in zero gravity and being a veteran

% gliding effortlessly through space as though you were

% dancing? The answer is training and skill. The greater

% your skill, the more likely you are to not only succeed

% at what you want to do, but succeed well.

%  Aptitudes in Eclipse Phase range from 1 to 30,

% while learned skills range from 0 to 99. These num-

% bers are an abstraction of the range of transhuman

% abilities and traits. The Aptitude Range table provides

% a breakdown of different aptitude levels and how they

% relate to each other. Likewise, the Learned Skill Range

% table provides an interpretation for the capabilities at

% different skill levels.




% APTITUDES

% There are 7 aptitudes in Eclipse Phase, described on p.

% 123. Each character has these aptitudes at a minimum

% rating of 1.


% APTITUDE-ONLY TESTS

% In rare cases, a test may call for using an aptitude

% only, rather than a learned skill. This should only

% occur when no learned skills are appropriate to the

% test, and these circumstances are usually noted in

% the rules.

%  Aptitude-only tests must be handled carefully, as

% the range of aptitude ratings (1–30) is typically much

% smaller than the rating of learned skills (0–99). For

% this reason, most aptitude tests should use a target

% number equal to the aptitude x 3. In rare cases where

% the test is more difficult, the gamemaster may simply

% use an aptitude x 2, or just the straight aptitude rating.

% In some cases, more than one aptitude may be rel-

% evant to the test, and so they may be added together

% to derive the target number.


% What follows are a few examples where an aptitude-

% only test might be appropriate. Gamemasters may call

% for similar tests in other situations, but learned skills

% should be used whenever possible.




% EXALTS
% e transhuman in the world of Eclipse Phase is faster,
% predecessors. Normal unaugmented humans, called
%  that was born in our time. The majority of people,
%  or exalts (p. 139) (well, those with biological bodies
%  d optimized for certain characteristics, while exalts
% ey are more attractive, more athletic, have greater
% und them than their unaugmented kin.                 ■

% %%% txt/177.txt
% BRUTE STRENGTH
% Any test that involves simple brute strength can be
% handled as an SOM x 3 Test. Use this when smashing
% down a door, breaking an item in half, engaging in a
% tug-of-war, or lifting and carrying a heavy item.

% CATCHING THROWN OBJECTS
% Use REF + (COO x 2) any time you need to catch a
% thrown or dropped object, such as catching a baseball,
% saving a priceless vase from shattering, or throwing
% back a grenade (see p. 200).

% COMPOSURE AND RESOLVE
% Various game situations may frighten your character,
% turn their stomach, horrify them, or rattle them to the
% core of their being. Use WIL x 3 to determine if your
% character can hold their ground, keep it down, and
% pull themselves together.

% ESCAPE ARTIST
% If a character wants to slip free of physical bonds (such
% as ropes or handcuffs) or otherwise contort themselves
% (such as wriggling out from under a collapsed wall or
% an overturned vehicle), an Escape Artist Test may be
% called for using the character’s COO + SOM. Apply
% modifiers appropriate to the difficulty of the situation.
% At the gamemaster’s discretion, escaping from some
% restraining situations may be considered a Task Action
% with an appropriate timeframe.

% HAVING AN IDEA
% Sometimes the players miss the obvious, or their per-
% sonal mindset or biases cause them to misinterpret a
% situation or understand events in a way different from
% how the actual character would. In cases like this, the
% gamemaster can call for an INT x 3 or COG x 3 roll
% (whichever is more appropriate) to determine if the
% character gets an idea that will help them along. This
% test should be used sparingly, and only for assessing
% the character’s interpretation of obvious and known
% facts and details.

% MEMORIZING AND REMEMBERING
% Memories are what egos use to maintain continuity of
% self from morph to morph, but humans are notorious
% for remembering things incorrectly. Whenever char-
% acters attempt to recall a memory or memorize some
% piece of information, use COG x 3 to determine how
% well they succeed. Note that characters with eidetic
% memory (p. 146 or 301) or mnemonic augmentation
% (p. 307) have perfect memory, so no test is required.

%  COMPLETE SKILL LIST

% This section details all of the learned skills avail-

% able in Eclipse Phase. Gamemasters and players

% may, of course, agree to add additional skills to

% this list as appropriate to their campaign.


%  ACADEMICS: [FIELD]

% Type: Field, Knowledge

% Linked Aptitude: COG


%  What it is: Academics covers any sort of spe-

% cialized non-applied knowledge you can only get

% through intensive education. Most theoretical and

% applied sciences, social sciences, transhumanities,

% etc. are covered by this skill. Most of the other

% skills listed in this chapter could also be taken as

% an Academics field, reflecting a working theoretical

% knowledge of the skill—for example, Academics:

% Armorer or Academics: Interrogation.


%  When you use it: Academics is used when a

% character wishes to call upon a specific body of

% knowledge. For example, Academics: Chemistry

% could be used to identify a particular substance,

% understand an unusual chemical reaction, or deter-

% mine what elements are needed to nanofabricate

% something that requires exotic materials. At the

% gamemaster’s discretion, some Academics-related

% tests might not be defaultable, given that only

% someone who has been educated in that subject is

% likely to be able to tackle it.

% Sample Fields: Archeology, Astrobiology, As-


%  tronomy, Astrophysics, Astrosociology, Bio-


%  chemistry, Biology, Botany, Computer Science,




% NECESSARY SKILLS
% While characters will need a mix of skills to
% ucceed in the varied tasks they encounter in
%  clipse Phase, some skills are crucial for any
% haracter. If a character lacks these, they will
%  ave a difficult time getting by, so it is impor-
% ant for players and gamemasters to know
% hese particular skills.

% Fray: Fray is the primary skill you use to avoid
%  etting hit in combat. Even if you plan to avoid
% ombat, being able to get out of the way when
%  ecessary is a handy survival skill to have.

% Networking: Unless you live in total isolation,
% ou need a Networking skill—preferably several.
%  etworking is how you interact with people in

% particular social circle to obtain information,
% pread rumors, call in favors, and so on.

% Perception: Perception Tests get called for
%  uite often, so if you want your character to
%  now what’s going on around them, make sure
% o get this skill. Investigation and Scrounging
%  re also good, but Perception is king.          ■

% cal Science, Psychology, Sociology, Xeno-archeology,

% Xenolinguistics, Zoology
% Specializations: As appropriate to the field

% ANIMAL HANDLING
% Type: Active, Social
%  Linked Aptitude: SAV

% What it is: Skilled animal handlers are able to
%  train and control a wide variety of natural and trans-
%  genic animals, including partial uplifts. Though many
%  animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few
% “ark” and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and
%  many others can be resurrected from genetic samples.
%  Exotic animals are considered a sign of prestige
%  among the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are
%  occasionally used to protect high-security installations.
%  Likewise, many habitats and settlements employ small
%  armies of partially uplifted, genetically modified, and
%  behavior-controlled creatures for sanitation or other
%  purposes. Many new and strange breeds of animal are
%  created daily to serve a variety of roles.

% When you use it: Animal Handling is used whenever
% you are trying to manipulate an animal, whether your
%  intent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking, in-
%  timidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into attacking.
% Your Margin of Success determines how effective you
%  are at convincing the creature. At the gamemaster’s
%  discretion, modifiers may be applied to the test. Like-
% wise, winning an animal over may sometimes take
%  time, and so could be handled as a Task Action with a
%  timeframe of five minutes or more.
%  Specializations: Per animal species (dogs, horses, smart

%  rats, etc.)

% TRAINING ANIMALS
% Training animals is a time-consuming task requiring
% repeated efforts and rewards to reinforce the trained
% behavior. Treat this as a Task Action with a timeframe
% of one day to one month, depending on the complex-
% ity of the action. Apply modifiers to this test based on
% the relative intelligence of the animal being trained,
% how domestic it is, and the complexity of the task.

% Once an animal has been trained, commanding
% it is treated as a Simple Success Test (p. 118) except
% for unusual or stressful situations, in which case the
% trainer receives a +30 modifier on their Animal Han-
% dling Tests when convincing the animal to complete
% the trained action.

% ART: [FIELD]
% Type: Field, Knowledge
% Linked Aptitude: INT

% What it is: Art confers the ability to create and eval-
% uate artistic endeavors. This is a particularly useful
% skill in Eclipse Phase, especially in the post-scarcity
% economies where creativity and vision can be a key
% component to a character’s reputation.

% When you use it: The Art skill can be used to either
% create a new work of art or to duplicate an existing
% piece of art in the hopes of passing it off as your own.
% The skill can also determine the approximate value of
% a piece of art either on the open market, for monetary
% exchange systems, or in terms of reputation for the
% artist.
% Sample Fields: Architecture, Criticism, Dance, Drama,

% Drawing, Painting, Performance, Sculpture, Simul-

% space Design, Singing, Speech, Writing
% Specializations: As appropriate to the field

% BEAM WEAPONS
% Type: Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: COO
% What it is: The Beam Weapons skill covers the usage
% and maintenance of standard coherent beam energy
% weapons such as lasers, particle beam weapons,
% plasma rifles, and microwave weapons (p. 338).

% When you use it: A player uses their Beam Weap-
% ons skill whenever attacking with a beam weapon in
% combat (p. 191). Beam Weapons may also be used for
% tests involving maintenance of the weapon, but not
% for repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
% Hardware: Armorer skill).
% Specializations: Lasers, Microwave Weapons, Particle

% Beam Weapons, Plasma Rifles

% BLADES
% Type: Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: SOM

% What it is: The Blades skill covers the usage and
% maintenance of standard bladed weapons (p. 334).

% When you use it: A player uses their Blades skill
% whenever attacking with a blade weapon in melee
% combat (p. 191). Blades may also be used for tests
% involving maintenance of the weapon, but not for
% repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
% Hardware: Armorer skill). This skill is used for blade
% weapons implanted in the body at the end of an ap-
% pendage (hands, forearms, feet, octomorph arms, etc.),
% but the Exotic Melee Weapon skill is used for blades
% implanted in other parts of the body.
% Specializations: Axes, Implant Blades, Knives, Swords

% CLIMBING
% Type: Active, Physical
% Linked Aptitude: SOM

% What it is: Climbing is the skill of ascending and
% descending sheer surfaces with or without the aid of
% specialized equipment.

% When you use it: This skill is used whenever a char-
% acter wishes to scale a climbable surface. For heights
% greater than one story, climbing is handled as a Task
% Action with a timeframe equivalent to one meter per
% Action Phase. For rappelling, the timeframe for de-
% scent is 50 meters per Action Turn. Climbing gear (p.
% 332-333) provides appropriate modifiers.
% Specializations: Assisted, Freehand, Rappelling

% %%% txt/180.txt
% CLUBS
% Type: Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: SOM

% What it is: The Clubs skill covers the usage and
% maintenance of standard blunt melee weapons such
% as batons or sticks (see p. 334).

% When you use it: Players use their Clubs skill when-
% ever they want to attack with a blunt weapon in melee
% combat (p. 191). The Clubs skill may also be used for
% tests involving maintenance of the weapon, but not
% for repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
% Hardware: Armorer skill).
% Specializations: Batons, Hammers, Staffs

% CONTROL
% Type: Active, Mental, Psi
% Linked Aptitude: WIL

% What it is: Control is the use of psi to manipulate
% individuals or actively penetrate their mental pro-
% cesses. This skill is only available to characters with
% the Psi trait (p. 147).

% When you use it: Use Control when taking a psionic
% tour through a foreign ego—messing around included.
% See Psi, p. 220.
% Specializations: By sleight

% DECEPTION
% Type: Active, Social
% Linked Aptitude: SAV

% What it is: Deception is your ability to act, bluff,
% con, fast talk, lie, misrepresent, and pretend. Accom-
% plished users of deception are able to convince anyone
% of nearly anything. This skill does not include using a
% physical disguise to appear to be another person (the
% Impersonate skill covers that area).

% When you use it: Use this skill whenever you want
% to deceive someone with words or gestures. A success-
% ful skill test means that you have passed off your de-
% ception convincingly. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
% someone who is actively alert for signs of deception
% may make an Opposed Test using the Kinesics skill.
% Specializations: Acting, Bluffing, Fast Talk

% DEMOLITIONS
% Type: Active, Technical
% Linked Aptitude: COG (no defaulting)

% What it is: Demolitions covers the use of controlled
% explosives.

% When you use it: Use it when making, placing, and
% disarming explosives and explosive devices. See De-
% molitions, p. 197.
% Specializations: Commercial Explosives, Disarming,

% Improvised Explosives

% DISGUISE

% Type: Active, Physical

% Linked Aptitude: INT

% What it is: Disguise is the art of physically altering
% your appearance so that you look like someone else.
% This includes both the use of props (wigs, contacts,
% skin pigments) and the altering of subtle physical
% characteristics (gait, posture, poise).

% When you use it: Use Disguise to fool someone into
% thinking you’re someone you’re not. This can be used
% to hide your identity or to make yourself look like
% someone in particular. When used against someone
% who knows your true look or the appearance of the
% person you are imitating, this is handled as an Op-
% posed Test against Perception or Investigation.
% Specializations: Cosmetic, Theatrical

% EXOTIC MELEE WEAPON: [FIELD]
% Type: Field, Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: SOM

% What it is: The Exotic Melee Weapon skill covers
% the use and maintenance of all melee weapons not
% covered by the Clubs or Blades skills (see p. 334).

% When you use it: Use the Exotic Melee Weapon skill
% when attacking someone with an exotic melee weapon
% in melee combat (p. 191).
% Sample Fields: Morning Star, Spear, Whip
% Specializations: N/A

% EXOTIC RANGED WEAPON: [FIELD]
% Type: Field, Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: COO

% What it is: Exotic Ranged Weapon skill includes
% the use and maintenance of all ranged weapons not
% covered by the Beam, Flechette, Kinetic, Sonic, or
% Throwing Weapons skills.

% When you use it: Use this skill whenever attacking with
% an exotic ranged weapon in ranged combat (p. 191).
% Sample Fields: Blowgun, Crossbow, Flamethrower,

% Slingshot
% Specializations: N/A

% FLIGHT
% Type: Active, Physical
% Linked Aptitude: SOM

% What it is: Flight is the skill of using your body to
% fly. This skill is used when sleeved in or jamming a
% winged or otherwise flight-capable morph (manual and
% remote-control flight are handled using Pilot skill).

% When you use it: Use this skill whenever you need to
% make an aerial maneuver, land in difficult conditions,
% maintain your course in steep winds, or otherwise
% keep from crashing or falling.
% Specializations: Diving, Landing, Takeoff, specific

% maneuvers

% FRAY
% Type: Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: REF

% What it is: Fray is the ability to get out of the way
% of incoming attacks, debris, or inconvenient passers-by.
% Characters that have a high Fray score are able to react
% quicker than others when dodging or maneuvering.

% When you use it: Whenever a character is physically
% attacked by an opponent in melee combat, roll Fray to
% avoid getting hit (see p. 191). Fray may also be used

% %%% txt/181.txt
% to dodge other events that may harm the character,
% such as avoiding a charging vehicle or jumping out of
% the way of a collapsing stack of crates.
% Specializations: Blades, Clubs, Full Defense, Unarmed

% FREE FALL
% Type: Active, Physical
% Linked Aptitude: REF

% What it is: Free Fall is about moving in free-fall and
% microgravity environments.

% When you use it: Use whenever you need to maneu-
% ver in a zero-g situation, such as propelling yourself
% across a large open space or making sure you don’t
% accidentally send yourself spinning off into space.
% Free Fall is also used when moving with spacesuit
% maneuvering jets and when parachuting.
% Specializations: Microgravity, Parachuting, Vacsuits

% FREERUNNING
% Type: Active, Physical
% Linked Aptitude: SOM

% What it is: Freerunning is part running, part gymnas-
% tics. It is about moving fast, maneuvering over/under/
% around/through obstacles, and placing your body
% where it needs to go. Freerunning/parkour is a popular
% pastime in habitats where open space is limited.

% When you use it: Use Freerunning whenever you
% need to overcome an obstacle via movement, such
% as hurdling a railing, rolling across the hood of a
% car, jumping across a pit, or swinging around a pole.
% Freerunning is also used for sprinting (p. 191) and full
% defense against attacks (p. 198).
% Specializations: Balance, Gymnastics, Jumping, Running

% GUNNERY
% Type: Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: INT

% What it is: Gunnery skill covers the use and main-
% tenance of large, vehicular, or non-portable weapons
% systems. Firing these weapons is more like playing a
% video game than firing a gun.

% When you use it: Use Gunnery when attacking with
% a vehicle-mounted weapon or weapon emplacement
% in ranged combat (p. 191).
% Specializations: Artillery, Missiles
% HARDWARE: [FIELD]
% Type: Field, Active, Technical
% Linked Aptitude: COG

% What it is: This skill encompasses the ability to
% build, repair, physically hack, and upgrade equipment
% of a specific type.

% When you use it: Hardware is primarily used to repair
% devices, vehicles, habitat systems, or synthetic morphs.
% See Building, Repairing, and Modifying below.
% Sample Fields: Aerospace (all air and space vehicles),

% Armorer (armor and weapons), Electronics (all

% computerized devices), Groundcraft, Implants, In-

% dustrial (habitat, factory, and life support systems),

% Nautical (watercraft and submarines), Robotics

% (synthetic morphs)
% Specializations: As appropriate to the field

% BUILDING
% Creating an item from scratch is handled as a Task
% Action with a timeframe determined by the gamemas-
% ter. The timeframe should be set according to the com-
% plexity of the object and could range from an hour
% (constructing a set of shelves) to days (assembling a
% robot from spare parts) to even months (building a
% house). Numerous factors may apply modifiers to
% the test, such as the use of entoptic blueprints/help
% manuals (+20) or poor working conditions (–10 to
% –30). Tools are also a factor, perhaps making the job
%  easier (superior tools +10 to +30), more difficult (poor
% or inadequate tools, –10 to –30), or even impossible
% (lack of required tools).

% REPAIRING
% Damaged items may be repaired in a similar manner. See
% the rules for Synthmorph and Object Repair, p. 209.

% MODIFYING
% Altering an object’s design and function follows the
% same basic rules as build and repair, above. The time-
% frame is determined by the gamemaster as appropriate
% to the modification.

% IMPERSONATION
% Type: Active, Social
% Linked Aptitude: SAV

% What it is: Impersonation is the skill of trying to
% pass yourself off as someone else in social situations,
% including virtual ones. This includes copying manner-
% isms and speech patterns and using accumulated in-
% formation to convince others that you are that person.
% In a universe where appearance is highly variable, the
% question of identity is largely one of both trust and
% picking up on behavioral quirks and verbal cues to
% recognize a given individual.

% When you use it: Sometimes it’s fun to pretend
% you’re someone else, and sometimes it’s profitable
% or lifesaving. Use this skill whenever you attempt
% to convince someone that you are actually someone
% else through some sort of social or online interaction.
% Forks use this skill when passing themselves off as
% their alpha ego. Impersonate is handled as an Op-
% posed Test against the Kinesics skill.
% Specializations: Avatar, Face-to-Face, Verbal

% INFILTRATION
% Type: Active, Physical
% Linked Aptitude: COO

% What it is: Infiltration is the art of escaping
% detection.

% When you use it: Use Infiltration whenever you
% need to physically hide or move with stealth to avoid
% someone sensing you, whether you are hiding behind
% a tree, sneaking past a guard, or blending into a
% crowd. Infiltration can also be used to follow people
% (shadowing) without them detecting you. Infiltration
% is an Opposed Test against the Perception of whom-
% ever you are hiding from. The gamemaster may wish
% to roll such tests in secret so the player does not know
% whether they have succeeded or failed.
% Specializations: Blending In, Hiding, Shadowing,

% INTIMIDATION
% Type: Active, Social
% Linked Aptitude: SAV

% What it is: Intimidation is convincing someone to
% do what you want based on direct threats (implied or
% actual) or sheer force of personality.

% When you use it: Use Intimidation to scare someone
% into submission, browbeat them into getting your way,
% command them to follow your orders, or berate them
% into giving up information. Influence is handled as an
% Opposed Test, pitted against the target’s WIL + WIL
% + SAV.
% Specializations: Interrogation, Physical, Verbal

% INVESTIGATION
% Type: Active, Mental
% Linked Aptitude: INT

% What it is: Investigation is the art of analyzing
% evidence, piecing together clues, solving mysteries,
% and making logical deductions from groups of facts.
% Investigation differs from Perception in that it is the
% conscious search for clues or pieces of a puzzle.

% When you use it: Use Investigation to draw conclu-
% sions from assorted details. For example, Investiga-
% tion could be used to determine the likely sequence
% of events at a crime scene, determine a possible social
% connection between two people, or deduce how an
% enemy made their escape. Investigation is a great way

% %%% txt/183.txt
% to provide clues to players, especially when the subject
% matter is something their character might know well
% but the player does not.
% Specializations: Evidence Analysis, Logical Deductions,

% Physical Investigation, Physical Tracking

% KINESICS
% Type: Active, Social
% Linked Aptitude: SAV

% What it is: Kinesics is the art of empathy and non-
% vocal communication.

% When you use it: Use Kinesics to read body language,
% tells, social cues, and other subconscious indicators. It
% can also be used to emote more effectively. Kinesics
% is used defensively whenever someone is trying to de-
% ceive you; make an Opposed Test against that person’s
% Deception or Impersonation skill.

% Though synthetic morphs are also designed to
% emote, reading them is not as easy. Apply a –30 modi-
% fier when judging a synthetic morph inhabited by a
% character or AGI. Likewise, standard AIs are also dif-
% ficult to read; apply a –60 modifier when judging a
% synthetic morph or pod operated by an AI.
% Specializations: Judge Intent, Nonvocal Communication

% JUDGING EMOTIONS AND INTENTIONS
% Transhumans are empathic beings, and so you can
% attempt to gauge the demeanor and/or intent of
% someone you are dealing with by rolling a Kinesics
% Test. This attempt to read someone is far from exact,
% however, and it is easy to misjudge. The gamemaster
% should make this test in secret and only allow a hint
% if successful—it is not possible to read someone with
% absolute certainty. If the person being judged is inten-
% tionally trying to deceive the character, this should be
% an Opposed Test against their Deception skill.

% NONVOCAL COMMUNICATION
% Experts in Kinesics can effectively communicate
% with each other simply by posture, stances, gestures,
% demeanors, and looks. Such communication is nec-
% essarily limited in the amount of information it can
% convey, but feelings, attitudes, affirmation/negation,
% and simple concepts may be passed. To effectively
% communicate complex concepts, the gamemaster may
% require successful Kinesics Tests from both parties, ap-
% plying modifiers as appropriate.

% KINETIC WEAPONS
% Type: Active, Combat
% Linked Aptitude: COO

% What it is: Kinetic Weapons covers the use and
% maintenance of standard kinetic projectile weapons

% LANGUAGES IN

% ECLIPSE PHASE

% With the Fall of Earth, the languages that

% remain most prominent in the solar system are

% those that were extensively carried into space

% by countries and hypercorps with aggressive

% space programs or by the large populations

% of poor laborers and infomorph refugees that

% followed. No single language dominated the

% realm of space expansion, and multilingual-

% ism was common. Many habitats and (sub)

% cultural groupings cling to specific languages

% as a method of retaining cultural identity. De-

% spite the availability of instant translation via

% the mesh, many people remain versed in two or

% more languages.

%  The ten most common languages in the solar

% system by speaking populations are: Arabic,

% Cantonese, English, French, Hindi, Japanese,

% Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

% Other languages that remain strong include

% Bengali, Dutch, Farsi, German, Italian, Javanese,

% Korean, Polish, Punjabi, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish,

% Urdu, Vietnamese, and Wu. Some languages

% were effectively lost during the Fall, especially

% those in some undeveloped regions, as their

% speaking populations did not migrate into space

% pre-Fall and were not privileged enough to sur-

% vive in large numbers as infomorph refugees. ■



% LANGUAGE: [FIELD]
% Type: Field, Knowledge
% Linked Aptitude: INT

% What it is: Language covers the speaking and
% reading of languages other than the player’s native
% tongue. A speaker is considered fluent at a skill level
% of 50; anything above this indicates further refine-
% ment in technical vocabulary, accents, and knowl-
% edge of dialects.

% When you use it: Use the Language skill whenever
% you want to speak, understand, or read something in
% a language at which you are skilled. Most speaking
% and reading comprehension tests can be considered
% Simple Success Tests if your skill is over 50, unless the
% gamemaster rules the subject is sufficiently complex
% that a non-native speaker would have trouble under-
% standing it.
% Sample Fields: Arabic, Cantonese, English, French,

% Investigation in that it is noticing things by chance,
% rather than actively searching for something.

% When you use it: Use Perception whenever you
% wanted to take a detailed account of your surround-
% ings (see Detailed Perception, p. 190). Perception
% can also be considered an Automatic Action (see
% Basic Perception, p. 190) and so the gamemaster may
% call for a Perception Test to determine if you notice

% USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
% t first glance, it may seem that Knowledge skills have
%  wer in-game applications than Active skills. To some
% egree this is the case. The importance of Knowledge

% ills, however, should not be underestimated. While
% hey play a role in analyzing clues and solving myster-
%  s, the real value of Knowledge skills is in helping the
% haracters—and the players—understand the world of
% clipse Phase. In particular these skills can be used to
%  ake plans, assess a situation, identify strengths and
%  eaknesses, evaluate worth, make comparisons, forecast
% robable outcomes, or understand the applicable science,
% ocio-economic factors, or cultural or historical context.

% For example, a group of characters looking to break
%  to a facility could use Profession: Security Procedures
% o evaluate the defenses, Academic: Architecture to
%  entify covert points of entry, Interests: Sports to plan

% eir infiltration at a time when the guards are likely to
% e distracted, Interests: Triads to identify a local crime
% roup that can sell them breaking and entering gear,
% nd Art: Sculpture when picking a valuable art piece
%  ith which to bribe an insider. When used appropriately,
% hese skills can be just as beneficial as the Active skills
% sed to break inside, if not more so because the plan
%  more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation.

% It is largely up to the gamemaster to enforce how
% seful Knowledge skills are in their game. The easiest
%  ay to reinforce their relevance is to penalize charac-
%  rs who don’t take advantage of them. For example,
% haracters who didn’t use their Profession: Security

% ocedures in the example above might end up being
% urprised when they run across a security system they
%  e not prepared to deal with, forcing them to impro-
%  se or even abandon their plans.                         ■

%  ECIAL SKILLS
%  hile the preceding list represents the skills most commonly

% in Eclipse Phase, there may be certain skills called for in a
% paign that are not found in this book. In this case, the game-
% ter may work with the players to create a new skill to fill
% void. This option should be used sparingly to prevent skill
% t, and all skills are subject to approval by the gamemaster
% you choose to create a new skill, keep in mind that it needs
% e linked to an existing aptitude and should be a skill that
%  ailable to all characters, not just specific to one character.

% AND COMBAT■ACTION AND COMBAT■



% N AND COMBAT
% Roleplaying games are about creating drama and
% adventure, and that usually means action and
% combat. Action and combat scenes are the moments
% when the adrenaline really gets pumping and the
% characters’ lives and missions are on the line.

% Combat and action scenarios can be confusing
% to run, especially if the gamemaster also needs to
% keep track of the actions of numerous NPCs. For
% these reasons, it’s important for the gamemaster to
% detail the action in a way that everyone can visual-
% ize, whether that means using a map and miniatures,
% software, a dry-erase board, or quick sketches on
% a piece of paper. Though many of the rules for
% handling action and combat are abstract—allowing
% room for interpretation and fudging results to fit
% the story—many tactical factors are also incorpo-
% rated, so even small details can make a large differ-
% ence. It also helps to have the capabilities of NPCs
% predetermined and to run them as a group when
% possible, to reduce the gamemaster’s burden in the
% middle of a hectic situation.



%  ACTION TURNS
% Action scenes in Eclipse Phase are handled in bite-
% size chunks called Action Turns, each approximately
% 3 seconds in length. We say “approximately” be-
% cause the methodical, step-by-step system used to
% resolve actions does not necessarily always translate
% realistically to real life, where people often pause,
% take breaks to assess the situation, take a breather,
% and so on. A combat that begins and ends within 5
% Action Turns (15 seconds) in Eclipse Phase could
% last half a minute to several minutes in real life. On
% the other hand, the characters may be in a situation
% where their breathing environment decompresses to
% vacuum in 15 seconds, so every second may in fact
% count. As a rule, gamemasters should stick with 3
% seconds per turn, but they shouldn’t be afraid to
% fudge the timing either when a situation calls for it.

% Action Turns are meant to be utilized for combat
% and other situations where timing and the order in
% which people act is important. If it is not necessary
% to keep track of who’s doing what so minutely, you
% can drop out of Action Turns and return to “regu-
% lar” free form game time.

% Each Action Turn is in turn broken down into
% distinct stages, described below.

%  STEP 1: ROLL INITIATIVE
% At the beginning of every Action Turn, each PLAYER
% involved in the scene rolls Initiative to determine the
% order in which each character acts. For more details,
% see Initiative.
% CTION AND COMBAT■ACTION AND CO



%                                                       7


%  STEP 2: BEGIN FIRST ACTION PHASE
%  Once Initiative is rolled, the fi rst Action Phase
%  begins. Everyone gets to act in the first Action Phase
%  (since everyone has a minimum Speed of 1), unless
%  they happen to be unconscious/dead/disabled, start-
%  ing with the character with the highest successful
%  Initiative roll.

%  STEP 3: DECLARE AND RESOLVE ACTIONS
%  The character going first now declares and resolves
%  the actions they will take during this first Action
%  Phase. Since some actions the character makes may
%  depend on the outcome of others, there is no need
%  to declare them all first—they may be announced
%  and handled one at a time.

% As described under Actions (p. 189), each charac-
%  ter may perform a varying number of Quick Actions
%  and/or a single Complex Action during their turn.
%  Alternately, a character may begin or continue with
%  a Task Action, or delay their action pending other
%  developments (see Delayed Actions, p. 189).

% A character who has delayed their action may
%  interrupt another character at any point during this
%  stage. That interrupting character must complete
%  this stage in full, then the action returns to the in-
%  terrupted character to finish the rest of their stage.

%  STEP 4: ROTATE AND REPEAT
%  Once the character has resolved their actions for
%  that phase, the next character in the Initiative order
%  gets to go, running through Step 3 for themselves.

%  If every character has completed their actions
%  for that phase, return to Step 2 and go the second
%  Action Phase. Every character with a Speed of 2 or
%  more gets to go through Step 3 again, in the same
%  Initiative order (modified by wound modifiers).
%  Once the second Action Phase is completed, return
%  to Step 2 for the 3rd Action Phase, where every
%  character with a Speed of 3 or more gets to go for
%  a third time. Finally, after everyone eligible to go in
%  the 3rd Action Phase has gone, return to Step 2 for
%  a fourth and last Action Phase, where every charac-
%  ter with a Speed of 4 can act for one final time.

% At the end of the fourth Action Phase, return to Step
%  1 and roll Initiative again for the next Action Turn.



%  INITIATIVE
%  Timing in an Action Turn can be critical—it may mean
%  life or death for a character who needs to get behind
%  cover before an opponent draws and fires their gun.
%  The process of rolling Initiative determines if a char-
%  acter acts before or after another character.

% %%% txt/191.txt
% INITIATIVE ORDER
% A character’s Initiative stat is equal to their Intuition +
% Reflexes aptitudes multiplied by 2. This score may be
% further modified by morph type, implants, drugs, psi,
% or wounds.

% In the first step of each Action Turn, every charac-
% ter makes an Initiative Test, rolling d100 and adding
% their Initiative stat. Whoever rolls highest goes first,
% followed by the other characters in descending order,
% highest to lowest. In the event of a tie, characters go
% simultaneously.




%       Adam, Bob, and Cami are rolling Initiative. Adam’s


%       Initiative stat is 80, Bob’s is 110, and Cami’s is 60.


%       Adam rolls a 38, Bob rolls a 24, and Cami rolls a
%  EXAMPLE






%       76. Adam’s total Initiative score is 118 (80 + 38),


%       Bob’s is 134 (110 + 24), and Cami’s is 136 (60 +


%       76). Cami rolled highest, so she goes first, followed


%       by Bob and then Adam. If Cami & Bob had tied,


%       they would both go at the same time.


% INITIATIVE AND DAMAGE
% Characters who are suffering from wounds have their
% Initiative score temporarily reduced (see Wounds, p.
% 207). This modifier is applied immediately when the
% wound is taken, which means that it may modify an
% Initiative score in the middle of an Action Turn. If a
% character is wounded before they go in that Action
% Phase, their Initiative is reduced accordingly, which
% may mean they now go after someone they were pre-
% viously ahead of in the Initiative order.




%       Before Bob’s Action Phase comes up, Bob takes
%  EXAMPLE






%       two wounds, knocking his Initiative down from


%       134 to 114. This means that Adam, with an Initia-


%       tive of 118, now goes before him.


% INITIATIVE, MOXIE, AND CRITICALS
% A character may spend a point of Moxie to go first in
% an Action Phase, regardless of their Initiative roll (see
% Moxie, p. 122). If more than one character chooses
% this option, then order is determined as normal first
% among those who spent Moxie, followed by those
% who didn’t.

% Similarly, any character that rolls a critical on Ini-
% tiative automatically goes first, even before someone
% who spent Moxie. If more that two characters rolled
% criticals, determine order between them as normal.

% SPEED
% Speed determines how many times a character can
% act during an Action turn. Every character starts with
% a default Speed stat of 1, meaning they can act in the
% first Action Phase of the turn only. Certain morphs,
% implants, drugs, psi, and other factors may cumu-
% latively increase their Speed to 2, 3, or even 4 (the
% maximum), allowing them to act in further Action

% SIMPLIFYING

% INITIATIVE

% For speedier resolution, simply have characters

% roll Initiative once for an entire scene. That

% Initiative result stays with them on each Action

% Turn until the combat or scenario is over. Like-

% wise, ignore Initiative modifiers from wounds. ■




% Phases as well. For example, a character with Speed
% 2 can act in the first and second Action Phases, and
% a character with Speed 3 can act in the first through
% third Action Phases. A character with Speed 4 is
% able to act in every Action Phase. This represents
% the character’s enhanced reflexes and neurology, al-
% lowing them to think and act much faster than non-
% enhanced characters.

% If a character’s Speed does not allow them to act
% during an Action Phase, they can initiate no actions
% during the pass—they must simply bide their time.
% The character may still defend themself, however, and
% any automatic actions remain “on.” Note that any
% movement the character initiated is considered to still
% be underway even during the Action Phases they do
% not participate in (see Movement, p. 190).

% DELAYED ACTIONS
% When it’s your turn to go during an Action Phase,
% you may decide that you’re not ready to act yet. You
% may be awaiting the outcome of another character’s
% actions, hoping to interrupt someone else’s action, or
% may simply be undecided about what to do yet. In this
% case, you may opt to delay your action.

% When you delay your action, you’re putting your-
% self on standby. At some later point in that Action
% Phase, you can announce that you are now taking
% your action—even if you interrupt another character’s
% action. In this case, all other activity is put on hold
% until your action is resolved. Once your action has
% taken place, the Initiative order continues on where
% you interrupted.

% You may delay your action into the next Action
% Phase, or even the next Action Turn, but if you do not
% take it by the time your next action comes around in
% the Initiative order, then you lose it. Additionally, if
% you do delay your action into another phase or turn,
% then once you take it you lose any action you might
% have in that Action Phase.



% ACTIONS
% When it’s your turn to act during an Action Phase,
% you have many options for what you can do—far too
% many to list here. There is a limit to what you can
% accomplish in 3 seconds, however, so some limita-
% tions must be adhered to. The first step is to figure

% %%% txt/192.txt
% out what type of action you want to take. In Eclipse
% Phase, actions are categorized as Automatic, Quick,
% Complex, or Task, based on how much time and
% effort they entail.

% AUTOMATIC ACTIONS
% Automatic Actions require no effort. These are abili-
% ties or activities that are “always on” (assuming you
% are conscious) or are otherwise reflexive (they happen
% automatically in response to certain conditions, with
% no effort from you). Breathing, for example, is an au-
% tomatic action—your body does it without conscious
% effort or thinking on your part.

% In most cases, Automatic Actions are not something
% that you initiate—they are always active, or at least
% on standby. Certain circumstances, however, will bring
% an Automatic Action to bear. Such Automatic Actions
% are invoked and handled immediately whenever they
% apply, without requiring effort from your character.

% RESISTANCE
% Resisting damage—whether from combat, a poison, or
% a psi attack—is one example of an Automatic Action
% that occurs in response to something else.

% BASIC PERCEPTION
% Your senses are continuously active, accumulating data
% on the world around you. Basic perception is consid-
% ered an Automatic Action, and so the gamemaster can
% call on you to make a Perception Test whenever you
% receive sensory input that your brain might want to
% take notice of (see Perception, p. 182). Likewise, you
% may ask the gamemaster at any time—even during
% other character’s actions—to make a basic Perception
% Test, just to find out what your character is noticing
% around them.

% Because basic perception is an automatic, subcon-
% scious activity, however, you will suffer a –20 modifier
% for distraction—your attention is focused elsewhere.
% In order to avoid the distraction modifier, you must
% actively engage in detailed perception or use an oracle
% implant (p. 308).

% QUICK ACTIONS
% Quick Actions are fast and simple, and they may often
% be multi-tasked. They require minimal thought and
% effort. You may undertake multiple Quick Actions on
% your turn during each Action Phase, limited only by
% the gamemaster’s judgment. If you are taking noth-
% ing but Quick Actions during an Action Phase, you
% should be allowed a minimum of 3 separate Quick
% Actions. If you are also engaging in a Complex or Task
% Action during that same Action Phase, you should be
% allowed a minimum of 1 Quick Action. Ultimately, the
% gamemaster decides what activity you can or can’t fit
% into a single Action Phase.

% Some examples of Quick Actions include: talking,
% switching a safety, activating an implant, standing
% up, dropping prone, gesturing, drawing/readying a
% weapon, handling an object, or using a simple object.
% AIMING
% Aiming is a special case in that it is a Quick Action
% but requires a degree of concentration that rules out
% other minor actions. If you wish to aim before making
% an attack in the same Action Phase, aiming is the only
% Quick Action you may make during that Action Phase
% (see Aimed Shots, p. 193).

% DETAILED PERCEPTION
% Detailed perception involves taking a moment to
% actively use your senses in search of information and
% assess what you are perceiving (see Perception, p.
% 182). It requires slightly more effort and brainpower
% (or computer power) than basic perception, which is
% automatic. As a Quick Action, you may only engage
% in detailed perception on your turn during an Action
% Phase, but you do not suffer a modifier for distrac-
% tion (unless you happen to be in a heavily distracting
% environment, such as a gunfight or agitated crowd).

% COMPLEX ACTIONS
% Complex Actions require more concentration and
% effort than Quick Actions—they effectively monopo-
% lize your attention. You may only take one Complex
% Action on each your Action Phase turns. Additionally,
% you may not engage in a Complex Action and a Task
% Action during the same Action Phase.

% Examples of Complex Actions include: attacking,
% shooting, acrobatics, full defense, disarming a bomb,
% using a complex device, or reloading a weapon.

% TASK ACTIONS
% A Task Action is any activity that requires longer than one
% Action Turn to complete. Each Task Action lists a time-
% frame for how long the task takes to accomplish. This
% timeframe may range anywhere from 2 Action Turns to 2
% years. While engaged in a Task Action, you may not also
% undertake a Complex Action, though in some cases you
% may take a break from the task and return to it later. For
% more information, see Task Actions, p. 120.

% Examples of Task Actions include: repairing a
% device, programming, conducting a scientific analysis,
% searching a room, climbing a wall, or cooking a meal.



% MOVEMENT
% Movement in Eclipse Phase is handled just like any
% other action, and may change from Action Phase to
% Action Phase. Walking and running both count as Quick
% Actions, as they do not require your full concentration.
% The same also applies to slithering, crawling, floating,
% hovering, or gliding. Running, however, may inflict a
% –10 modifier on other actions that are affected by your
% jostling movement. Even more, sprinting is an all-out run,
%  and so requires a Complex Action (see Sprinting, p. 191).

% At the gamemasters discretion, other movement
%  may also call for a Complex Action. Hurdling a fence,
% pole vaulting, jumping from a height, swimming, or
% freerunning through a habitat in zero-gravity all re-
% quire a bit of finesse and attention to detail, so would

% %%% txt/193.txt
% count as a Complex Action, and would apply the
% same modifier as running. Flying generally counts as a
% Quick Action, though intricate maneuvers would call
% for a Complex Action.

% MOVEMENT RATES
% Sometimes it’s important to know not just how you’re
% moving, but how far. For most of transhumanity, this
% movement rate is the same: 4 meters per Action Turn
% walking, 20 meters per turn running. To determine
% how far a character can move in a particular Action
% Phase, divide this movement rate by the total number
% of Action Phases in that turn. In a turn with 4 Action
% Phases, that breaks down to 1 meter walking per
% Action Phase, 5 meters running.

% Movement such as swimming or crawling bench-
% marks at about 1 meter per Action Turn, or 0.25
% meters per Action Phase. You can also sprint to in-
% crease your movement rate (see Sprinting). Vehicles,
% robots, creatures, and unusual morphs will have indi-
% vidual movement rates listed in the format of walking
% rate/running rate in meters per turn.

% These movement rates assume standard Earth
% gravity of course. If you’re moving in a low-gravity,
% microgravity, or high-gravity environment, things
% change. See Gravity, p. 198.

% JUMPING
% Characters making a running jump can cross SOM ÷
% 5 (round up) meters; use SOM ÷ 20 (round up) meters
% for standing jumps. Vertical jumping height is 1 meter.
% Characters making a Freerunning Test can increase
% jumping distance by 1 meter (running jump) or 0.25
% meters (standing/vertical jumps) per 10 points of MoS.

% SPRINTING
% You may use Freerunning to increase the distance
% you move during an Action Phase. You must spend
% a Complex Action to sprint and make a Freerunning
% Test. Every 10 points of MoS increases your running
% distance in that Action Phase by 1 meter, to a maxi-
% mum bonus of +5 meters.
% COMBAT
% Sometimes words fail, and that’s when the knives and
% shredders come out. All combat in Eclipse Phase is
% conducted using the same basic mechanics, whether it’s
% conducted with claws, fists, weapons, guns, or psi: an
% Opposed Test between the attacker and defender(s).

% RESOLVING COMBAT
% Use the following sequence of steps to determine the
% outcome of an attack.

% STEP 1: DECLARE ATTACK
% The attacker initiates by taking a Complex Action to
% attack on their turn during an Action Phase. The skill
% employed depends on the method used to attack. If
% the character lacks the appropriate Combat skill, they
% must default to the appropriate linked aptitude.

% STEP 2: DECLARE DEFENSE
% Once the attack is declared, the defender chooses how
% to respond. Defense is always considered an Automatic
% Action unless the defender is surprised (see Surprise,
% p. 204) or somehow incapacitated and incapable of
% defending themself.

% Melee: A character defending against melee at-
% tacks uses Fray skill, representing dodging (if the
% character lacks this skill, they may default to Re-
% flexes). Alternately, the character may use a melee
% combat skill to defend, representing blocks and par-
% ries rather than dodging.

% Ranged: Against ranged attacks, a defending char-
% acter may only use half their Fray skill (round down).

% Full Defense: Characters who have taken a Com-
% plex Action to go on full defense (p. 198) receive a
% +30 modifier to their defensive roll.

% Psi: A character defending against a psi attack rolls
% WIL x 2 (p. 222). A mental sort of full defense may
% also be rallied against psi attacks.

% %%% txt/194.txt
% STEP 3: APPLY MODIFIERS
% Any appropriate modifiers are now applied to the
% attacker and defender’s skills. See the Combat Modi-
% fiers table (p. 193) for common situational modifiers.

% STEP 4: MAKE THE OPPOSED TEST
% The attacker and defender both roll d100 and com-
% pare the results to their modified skill target numbers.

% STEP 5: DETERMINE OUTCOME
% If the attacker succeeds and the defender fails, the
% attack hits. If the defender succeeds but the at-
% tacker fails, the attack misses completely.

% If both attacker and defender succeed in their
% tests, compare their dice rolls. If the attacker’s
% dice roll is higher, the attack hits despite a spirited
% defense; otherwise, the attack fails to connect.

% Excellent Success: If the attacker rolled an Ex-
% cellent Success (MoS of 30+), a solid hit is struck.
% Increase the Damage Value (DV) inflicted by +5. If
% the MoS is 60+, increase the DV by +10.

% Criticals: If the attacker rolls a critical success,
% the attack is armor-defeating, meaning that the
% defender’s armor is bypassed completely—some
% kink or flaw was exploited, allowing the attack to
% get through completely.

% If the defender rolls a critical success, the attack-
% er’s weapon breaks, jams, gets stuck somewhere,
% or otherwise malfunctions or gets dropped.

% STEP 6: MODIFY ARMOR
% If the target is hit, their armor will help to pro-
% tect them against the attack (unless the attacker
% rolled a critical, see above). Determine which type
% of armor is appropriate to defending against that
% particular attack (see Armor, p. 194). The attack’s
% Armor Penetration (AP) value reduces the armor’s
% rating, however, representing the weapon’s ability
% to pierce through protective measures.

% STEP 7: DETERMINE DAMAGE
% Every weapon and type of attack has a Damage
% Value (DV, see p. 207). This amount is reduced
% by the target’s AP-modified armor rating. If the
% damage is reduced to 0 or less, the armor is ef-
% fective and the attack fails to injure the target.
% Otherwise, any remaining damage is applied to the
% defender. If the accumulated damage exceeds the
% defender’s Durability, they are incapacitated and
% may die (see Durability and Health, p. 207).

% Note that some psi attacks inflict mental stress
% rather than physical damage (see Mental Health, p.
% 209). In this case, the Stress Value (SV) is handled
% the same as DV.

% STEP 8: DETERMINE WOUNDS
% The damage inflicted from a single attack is then
% compared to the victim’s Wound Threshold. If
% the armor-modified DV equals or exceeds the
% Wound Threshold, the character suffers a wound.
% Multiple wounds may be applied with a single attack
% if the modified DV is two or more factors beyond the
% Wound Threshold. Wounds represent more serious
% injuries and apply modifiers and other effects to the
% character (see Wounds, p. 207).



% Stoya tried to get off the station quickly, but the Night

% Cartel’s assassin caught up, surprising her in a micro-

% gravity part of the habitat. The assassin’s INIT is 63,

% plus a dice roll of 23, for an Initiative of 86. Stoya’s

% INIT is 55, plus a roll of 27, for an Initiative of 82.


% The assassin goes first, spending a Quick Action

% to draw a shredder. This flechette weapon is in

% burst-fire mode, so with a Complex Action the as-

% sassin can take two shots. His Spray Weapons skill

% is 65, he’s smartlinked (+10), and they’re at short

% range (+0), so he needs a 75 or less. Stoya is de-

% fending with her Fray skill (60) divided by 2, or 30.


% The assassin rolls an 08 with the first shot. Amaz-

% ingly, Stoya rolls a 28. They both succeeded, but

% Stoya rolled higher, so she dodges the first shot.


% The assassin rolls a 20 for his second shot, an-

% other hit, and this time Stoya rolls an 83, a failure.

% The assassin also scored an Excellent Success with

% a MoS of 55, increasing the DV by +5.


% The assassin’s base damage is 2d10 + 5, but he’s

% using burst fire against a single target for +1d10,

% and it’s also a cone effect weapon at short range,

% for an additional +1d10, for a total DV of 4d10 +

% 5. The assassin rolls 4d10 and gets 16, then adds

% the +5 for a total DV of 21.


% Stoya’s wearing light body armor (AV 10/10),


%                                                          EXAMPLE





% but the shredder’s Armor penetration is –10, so her

% armor is entirely negated. She takes a devastating 21

% DV, exceeding her Wound Threshold of 10, not just

% once, but twice. This means Stoya suffers 2 wounds

% from the shot, suffering –20 to all actions. In addi-

% tion, she must make two SOM x 3 Tests, one to avoid

% knockdown and the other to avoid unconsciousness.

% Her SOM is 30, meaning she needs a 70 (30 x 3 =

% 90, 90 – 20 wound modifiers = 70) on both rolls.

% She rolls a 40 and a 27, succeeding both.


% Now it’s Stoya’s action. She takes a Quick Action

% to pull her own weapon: a stunner. Her Beam

% Weapons skill is 47, modified by wounds (–20) and

% a smartlink (+10), for 37. The assassin’s Fray is 48,

% divided by 2 for 24 against a ranged attack. Stoya

% rolls a 22—a critical hit—and the assassin rolls a

% 68. The stunner only inflicts 1d10 ÷ 2 DV, but since

% the attack is a critical hit, this is armor defeating.

% Stoya rolls an 8, for 4 points of DV, below the as-

% sassin’s Wound Threshold of 7.


% Stunners, however, are shock weapons, so the

% assassin must make a DUR + Energy Armor Test.

% His DUR is 35 and he’s wearing an armor vest (AV

% 6/6), so his target number is 41. He rolls a 71—a

% Margin of Failure of 30, meaning he is immediately

% incapacitated for 3 Action Turns.


% Having disabled her opponent, Stoya takes the

% time to make a hasty getaway.

% COMBAT SUMMARY
% • Combat is handled as an Opposed Test.
% • Attacker rolls attack skill +/– modifiers.
% • Melee: Defender rolls Fray or melee skill

% +/– modifiers.
% • Ranged: Defender rolls (Fray skill ÷ 2, round

% down) +/– modifiers.
% • If attacker succeeds and rolls higher than the

% defender, the attack hits.
% • Critical hits are armor-defeating (armor does

% not apply).
% • Armor is reduced by the attack’s Armor

% Penetration value (AP).
% • The weapon’s damage is reduced by the

% target’s modified Armor rating (unless the

% attack is armor-defeating).
% • If the damage exceeds the target’s Wound

% Threshold, a wound is also scored. (If the

% damage exceeds the Wound Threshold

% by multiple factors, multiple wounds are

% inflicted.)



% ACTION AND COMBAT COMPLICATIONS
% Combat isn’t quite as simple as deciding if you hit or
% miss. Weapons, armor, ammunition, and numerous
% other factors may impact an attack’s outcome. Like-
% wise, various factors can impact an action scene, such
% as fire or microgravity effects.

% AIMED SHOTS
% As noted under Aiming, p. 190, a character can sacri-
% fice their other Quick Actions to concentrate on tar-
% geting a ranged attack and receive a +10 modifier on
% the attack. You can also sacrifice an entire Complex
% Action to fix your aim on a target. In this case, as long
% as the target remains in your sights until your next
% Action Phase, you receive a +30 modifier to hit.

% AMMUNITION AND RELOADING
% Every weapon has a listed ammunition capacity that
% indicates how many shots the weapon can carry or
% holds. When this ammo runs out, a new supply must
% be loaded in. Players should keep track of the shots

% Reloading almost always requires a Complex
% Action, whether you are slapping in a new clip of bul-
% lets or a fresh battery for a laser. At the gamemaster’s
% discretion, a reload that is immediately accessible
% (such as a new clip reverse-taped to the loaded clip, so
% that reloading just requires that you reverse the taped
% clips and slot the new one in) will only take a Quick
% Action. Archaic weapons such as magazine-fed rifles
% may require longer to fully load.

% AREA EFFECT WEAPONS
% Some ranged attack weapons are designed to affect
% more than one target at a time. These weapons fall
% into three categories: blast, uniform blast, and cone.

%  BLAST EFFECT
%  Blast weapons include items like grenades, mines, and
%  other explosives that expand outward from a central
%  detonation point. Most blast attacks expand outward
%  in a sphere, though certain shaped charges may direct
%  an explosion in one direction only. The explosive force
%  is stronger near the epicenter and weaker near the
%  outer edges of the sphere. For every meter a target is
%  from the center, reduce the damage of a blast weapon
%  by –2.

% %%% txt/196.txt
% UNIFORM BLAST
% Uniform blast attacks distribute their power evenly
% throughout the area of effect. Examples include fuel-
% air explosives and thermobaric weapons that disperse
% an explosive mixture in a vapor cloud and ignite it all
% at once. All targets within the noted blast radius suffer
% the same damage. Damage against targets outside of
% the main blast sphere is reduced by –2 per meter.

% CONE
% Weapons with a cone effect have an area effect that
% begins with the tip of the weapon and expands out-
% ward in a cone. At short range, this attack effects 1
% target; at medium range it affects 2 targets within a
% meter of each other; and at long or extreme range
% it affects 3 targets within a meter of the next. Cone
%  effect attacks do +1d10 damage at short range and
% –1d10 damage at long and extreme range.

% ARMOR
% Just as weapons technologies have advanced, so too
% has armor quality, allowing unprecedented levels of
% protection. As noted in Step 7: Determine Damage
% (see p. 192), the armor rating reduces the damage
% points of the attack.

% For a full listing of armor types and values, see p.
% 311.

% ENERGY VS. KINETIC
% Each type of armor has an Armor value (AV) with two
% ratings—Energy and Kinetic—representing the protec-
% tion it applies against the respective type of attack.
% These are listed in the format of “Energy armor/Kinetic
% armor.” For example, an item with listed armor “5/10”
% provides 5 points of armor against energy-based at-
% tacks and 10 points of armor against kinetic attacks.

% Energy damage includes that caused by beam weap-
% ons (laser, microwave, particle beam, plasma, etc.) as
% well as fire and high-energy explosives. Armor that
% protects against this damage is made of material that
% reflects or diffuses such energy, dissipates and trans-
% fers heat, or ablates.

% Kinetic damage is the transfer of damaging energy
% when an object in motion (a fist, knife, club, or bullet,
% for example) impacts with another object (the target).
% Most melee and firearms attacks inflict kinetic damage,
% as would a rolling boulder, swinging pendulum, or
% explosion-driven fragments. Kinetic armors include
% impact-resistant plates, shear-thickening liquid and
% gels that harden upon impact, and ballistic and cut-
% proof fiber weaves.

% ARMOR PENETRATION
% Some weapons have an Armor Penetration (AP) rating.
% This represents the attack’s ability to pierce through
% protective layers. The AP rating reduces the value of
% armor used to defend against the attack (see Step 6:
% Modify Armor, p. 192).
% LAYERED ARMOR
% If two or more types of armor are worn, the armor
% ratings are added together. However, wearing multiple
% armor units is cumbersome and annoying. Apply a –20
% modifier to a character’s actions for each additional
% armor layer worn

% Note that items specifically noted as armor accesso-
% ries—helmets, shields, etc.—do not inflict the layered
% armor penalty, they simply add their armor bonus.
% Note also that the armor inherent to a synthetic
% morph or bot’s frame does not constitute a layer of
% armor (i.e., you may wear armor over the synthetic
% shell without penalty).

% ASPHYXIATION
% The average transhuman can hold their breath for
% two minutes before blacking out. Strenuous activity
% reduces the amount of time. For every 30 seconds
% after the first minute a biomorph is prevented from
% breathing, they must make a DUR Test. Apply a cu-
% mulative –10 modifier each time this test is rolled. If
% the character fails the test, they immediately fall un-
% conscious and begin to suffer damage from asphyxi-
% ation, at the rate of 10 points per minute, until they
% die or are allowed to breathe again. This damage does
% not cause wounds.

% Asphyxiating is a terrible process, often leading to
% panic. Characters who are being asphyxiated must
% make a WIL x 3 Test. If they fail, they suffer 1d10
% ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress and cannot perform
% any effective action to rescue themselves that Action
% turn. A character who succeeds may attempt to rescue
% themselves, and in fact they must make a WIL x 3
% Test to perform any other action not directly related
% to rescuing themselves (attacks against another char-
% acter, a creature, or an object holding the character
% underwater are exempt from this rule).

% BEAM WEAPONS
%  Due to emitting a continuous beam of energy rather
%  than single projectiles, beam weapons are easier to
% “home in” on a target. This means one of the fol-
%  lowing two rules may be used when making beam
%  weapon attacks. These options are not available for
% “pulse” beam weapons (like the laser pulser), as such
%  weapons emit energy in pulses rather than a continu-
%  ous beam.

% SWEEPING FIRE
% An attacker who is making two semi-auto (p. 198)
% attacks with a beam weapon with the same Complex
% Action and who misses with the first attack may treat
% that attack as a free Aim action (p. 190), receiving a
% +10 modifier for the second attack. In other words,
% though the first attack misses, the character takes the
% opportunity to sweep the beam closer to the target
% for the second attack. This only applies when both
% attacks are made against the same target.

% enters “chase scene” mode—a traveling narrative of

% Whether or not a chase is actually occurring, the
% gamemaster should remember that Max Velocity is
% not the only factor in high-speed situations. Environ-
% mental factors like terrain, weather conditions, navi-
% gation, pedestrians, and traffic can provide obstacles
% for shells to overcome. A shell tearing across a habitat
% in order to reach a bomb before it detonates should
% have to make several decisions and tests that may
% affect whether it gets there in time or not. Likewise, a
% shell seeking to shake off some hot pursuit will have
% to pull off some fancy maneuvering and hopefully find
% a shortcut or two in order to outrace their opponents.

% CRASHING
% Shells that suffer wounds during combat or chases
% may be force to make a Pilot Test to avoid crashing
% or may crash automatically. The exact circumstances
% of a crash are left up to the gamemaster, as best fits
% the story—the shell may simply skid to a stop, plow
% into a tree, fall from the sky, or flip over and land on
% a group of bystanders. Shells that strike other objects
% when they crash typically take further damage from
% the collision (see Collisions).

% COLLISIONS
% If a shell crashes into or intentionally rams a person
% or object, someone is likely to get hurt. To determine
% how much DV is inflicted, roll 1d10 and add the shell’s
% DUR divided by 10 (round up). This is the damage
% applied at walking speeds. If the shell was moving at
% running speeds, multiply the DV by 2. If the shell was
% moving at chase speeds, multiply the DV by the shell’s
% velocity ÷ 10 in meters per turn. Both the shell and
% whatever it strikes suffer this damage, assuming the
% collision is with something equal dense and hard. Soft
% and squishy objects like biomorphs will be less dam-
% aging to a shell (unless they happen to be in a hardsuit
% or battlesuit), in which case the shell will only suffer
% half damage from the collision. Kinetic armor defends
% against crash DV.

% If two moving shells collide head-on, calculate the
% damage from both and inflict to both. If two shells
% moving in the same direction collide, only count the
% difference in velocity.

% Passengers in a vehicle may also be damaged by col-
% lisions if they are not wearing proper safety restraints.
% They suffer one half the DV applied to their vehicle.





%     COLLISION DAMAGE

% Base Collision DV: 1d10 + (DUR ÷ 10)

% Running: DV x 2

% Chase Speeds: DV x (velocity ÷ 10)
% ATTACKING VEHICLE PASSENGERS
% During combat, passengers within a vehicle may be
% targeted separately from the vehicle itself. Attacks
% made against passengers this way do not harm the
% vehicle itself (unless an area effect weapon is used).
% Targeted passengers benefit both from cover (usually
% Major, –30) and from the vehicle’s structure, adding
% the vehicle’s Armor Value to their own.

% Passengers within a vehicle are generally not harmed
% by attacks made against the vehicle itself. Exceptions
% include area effect weapons and vehicle crashes. In
% both these cases, the passengers also benefit from the
% vehicle Armor Value.

% SHELL REMOTE CONTROL
% Any shell (or biomorph) with a puppet sock (also in-
%  cluded with all cyberbrains) may be remote controlled,
%  either by a character or a remote AI. This requires a
%  communications link between the teleoperator and
%  the shell (the “drone”). The teleoperator controls the
%  drone via an entoptic interface, and receives sensory
% input and other data via the drone’s mesh inserts.

% When under direct control, the shell’s AI (or resident
%  ego) is subsumed and put on standby. The drone only
%  acts as instructed. Each instruction counts as a Quick
% Action. In this situation, the drone acts with the same
% Initiative as the teleoperator. The teleoperator’s skills and
%  stats are used in place of the shell AI’s. Due to the nature
%  of remote operation, however, all tests are made with a
% –10 modifier. Multiple drones may be controlled at once,
% but commanding them requires separate Quick Actions
% unless they are receiving the same command. Direct
%  control teleoperation is not very feasible at extreme dis-
%  tances, due to the light-speed lag with communications.

% Alternately, the teleoperator can put the drone in
% autonomous mode, allowing the shell’s AI to resume
%  normal operations. The drone still follows the teleop-
%  erator’s commands to the best of its abilities. In this
%  mode, the drone functions normally, using its own
% Initiative and AI skills and stats.

% SHELL JAMMING
% “Jamming” is the colloquial term for a more direct
%  form of remote-control, using VR and XP technol-
%  ogy. When jamming, the drone’s puppet sock feeds
%  the drone’s sensory data directly to the teleoperator’s
%  mesh inserts. The teleoperator subsumes themself in
%  the drone’s sensorium, essentially “becoming” the
%  drone. In this case, the teleoperator surrenders con-
%  trol of their own morph, which slumps inertly. While
%  jamming, they suffer –60 on all Perception Tests or
%  attempts to take action with their morph.

% Jamming takes a Complex Action to engage and
%  disengage. A jamming teleoperator controls a drone
%  as if it were their own morph. Like direct control te-
%  leoperation, the jammer’s own skills and Initiative are
%  used in place of the drone’s AI. Jammers do not suffer
%  any teleoperation modifiers, but only one drone may
%  be jammed at a time.

% %%% txt/199.txt

% If the drone is killed or destroyed, the jammer is
% immediately dumped from their connection, resuming
% control of their own morph as normal. Getting dumped
% in this manner is extremely jarring, not the least be-
% cause the jammer experienced being killed/destroyed.
% As a result, the jammer suffers 1d10 mental stress.

% CALLED SHOTS

% Sometimes it’s not enough to just hit your target—
% you need to shoot out a window, knock the knife out
% of their hand, or hit that hole in their armor. You may
% declare that you are making a called shot before you
% initiate an attack, choosing one of the outcomes noted
% below. Called shots suffer a –10 modifier and require
% an Excellent Success (MoS 30+). If you beat that
% margin, you succeed with the called shot, and the re-
% sults noted below apply. If you don’t beat the margin
% but still succeed in the attack, you simply strike your
% target as normal.

% BYPASSING ARMOR
% Called shots may be used to target a hole or weak
% point in your opponent’s armor. If you beat the MoS,
% you strike an armor-defeating hit, and their armor
% does not apply. Note that in certain circumstances, a
% gamemaster may rule that an opponent’s armor simply
% doesn’t have a weak spot or unprotected area, and so
% disallow such called shots.

% DISARMING
% You may take a called shot to attempt to knock a
% weapon out of an opponent’s hand(s). If you beat the
% MoS, the victim suffers half damage from the attack (re-
% duced by armor as normal) and must make a SOM x 3
% Test with a –30 modifier to retain hold of the weapon.

% SPECIFIC TARGETING
% You may make a called shot with the intention of hitting
% a specific location or component on your target—for
% example: disabling the sensor unit on a bot, sweeping
% someone’s leg, or poking someone in the eye. If you beat
% the MoS, you hit the specific targeted spot. The game-
% master determines the result as appropriate to the attack
% and target—the component may be destroyed, the op-
% ponent may fall or be temporarily blinded, and so on.

% CHARGING
% An opponent who runs and attacks an opponent in
% melee combat in the same Action Phase is considered
% to be charging. A charging attacker still suffers the
% –10 modifier for running, but they receive a damage
% bonus on account of their momentum: increase the
% damage they inflict by +1d10.

% RECEIVING A CHARGE
% You may delay your action (see p. 189) in order to
% receive a charge, bracing yourself for impact, inter-
% rupting their action, and striking right before your
% charging does. In this situation, you receive a +20
% modifier for striking the charging opponent.
% DEMOLITIONS
% The most common use of the Demolitions skill is the
% placement, disarming, or manufacture of explosive
% devices, such as superthermite charges (p. 330) or
% grenades (p. 340).

% PLACING EXPLOSIVES
% A skilled demolitionist can place charges in a manner
% that will boost their effect. They can identify struc-
% tural vulnerabilities and weak points and focus a
% blast in these areas. They can determine how to blast
% open a safe without destroying the contents. They can
% focus the force of an explosion in a particular direc-
% tion, increasing the directed force while minimizing
% splash effects.

% Each of these scenarios calls for a successful De-
% molitions Test. The exact result is determined by
% the gamemaster according to the specific scenario.
% For example, using the examples above, targeting
% a weak point could double the damage inflicted on
% that structure. Shaping the charge to direct the force
% can triple the damage in that direction, as noted in
% the superthermite description (p. 330). An Excellent
% Success is likely to increase an explosive’s damage by
% +5, whereas a critical success would allow the blast to
% ignore armor.

% DISARMING
% Disarming an explosive device is handled as an Op-
% posed Test between the Demolitions skills of the dis-
% armer and the character who set the bomb.

% MAKING EXPLOSIVES
% A character trained in Demolitions can make ex-
% plosives from raw materials. These materials can be
% gathered the traditional way or they can be manufac-
% tured using a nanofabricator. Even nanofabbers with
% restricted settings to prevent explosives creation can
% be used, as explosives can be constructed from all
% manner of mundane chemicals and materials.

% The timeframe for making explosives is 1 hour per
% 1d10 points of damage the explosive will inflict. If a
% critical failure is rolled, the demolitionist may acciden-
% tally blow himself up, or the charge may be extremely
% weaker or more potent than expected (whichever is
% more likely to be disastrous).

% FALLING
% If a character falls, use the Falling Damage table to
% determine what injuries they suffer. Kinetic armor
% will mitigate this damage at
% half its value (round down).
% Gamemasters may also reduce             FALLING DA
% this damage if anything helped
% to break the fall (branches, soft      DISTANCE FALLEN
% surface) at their discretion.           1–2 meters


%                                    3–5 meters


%                                    6–8 meters


%                                    Over 8 meters

% %%% txt/200.txt
% FIRE
% Objects that come into contact with extreme heat or
% flames may catch fire at the gamemaster’s discretion,
% keeping in mind both the flammability of the material
% and the strength of the heat/flames. Burning items (or
% characters) will suffer 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) damage
% each Action Turn unless otherwise noted. Energy
% armor will protect against this damage, though it
% too may catch fire, reducing its value by the damage
% inflicted. Depending on the environmental conditions,
% fires are likely to grow larger unless somehow abated.
% Every 5 Action Turns, increase the DV inflicted (first
% to 1d10, then 2d10, then 3d10, then by increments
% of +5). Adverse conditions (such as rain) or efforts to
% extinguish the blaze will reduce the DV accordingly.

% Note that fire does not burn in vacuum. In micro-
% gravity, fire burns in a sphere and grows more slowly,
% as expanding gases push away the oxygen (increase
% the DV every 10 Action Turns). If there is a lack of air
% circulation, some microgravity fires may extinguish
% themselves.

% FIRING MODES AND RATE OF FIRE
% Every ranged weapon in Eclipse Phase comes with one
% or more firing modes that determines their rate of fire.
% These firing modes are detailed below.

% SINGLE SHOT (SS)
% Single shot weapons may only be fired once per
% Complex Action. These are typically larger or more
% archaic devices.

% SEMI-AUTOMATIC (SA)
% Semi-automatic weapons are capable of quick, re-
% peated fire. They may be fired twice with the same
% Complex Action. Each shot is handled as a separate
% attack.

% BURST FIRE (BF)
% Burst fire weapons release a number of quick shots
% (a “burst”) with a single trigger pull. Two bursts may
% be fired with the same Complex Action. Each burst
% is handled as a separate attack. Bursts use up 3 shots
% worth of ammunition.

% A burst may be shot against a single target (concen-
% trated fire), or against two targets who are standing
% within one meter of each other. In the case of concen-
% trated fire against a single target, increase the DV by
% +1d10.

% FULL AUTOMATIC (FA)
% Full-auto weapons release a hail of shots with a single
% trigger pull. Only one full-auto attack may be made
% with each Complex Action. This attack may be made a
% single target or against up to three separate targets, as
% long as each is within one meter of another. In the case
% of a concentrated fire on a single individual, increase
% the DV by +1d10 + 10. Firing in full automatic mode
% uses up 10 shots.

% FULL DEFENSE
% If you’re expecting to come under fire, you can
% expend a Complex Action to go on full defense. This
% represents that you are expending all of your energy
% to dodge, duck, ward off attacks, and otherwise get
% the hell out of the way until your next Action Phase.
% During this time, you receive a +30 modifier to defend
% against all incoming attacks.

% Characters who are on full defense may use Free-
% running rather than Fray skill to dodge attacks, repre-
% senting the gymnastic movements they are making to
% avoid being hit.

% GRAVITY
% Most characters in Eclipse Phase have considerable
% experience maneuvering in low gravity or micro-
% gravity and can perform normal actions without
% penalties. Even characters who grew up on planetary
% bodies or in rotating habitats have some familiarity
% with alternate gravities thanks to childhood train-
% ing in simulspace educational scenarios. The same is
% also true in reverse; characters who grew up in free

% %%% txt/201.txt
% fall have likely experienced simulations of life in a
% gravity well.

% At the gamemaster’s discretion, characters who
% have spent long periods acclimating to one range of
% gravity may find a shift in conditions a bit challeng-
% ing to cope with, at least until they grow accustomed
% to the new gravity. In this case, the gamemaster can
% apply a –10 modifier to both physical and social skills.
% The physical penalty results from simple difficulties
% in maneuvering. The social penalty applies because
% it’s hard to look impressive, intimidating, or seductive
% when you haven’t figured out how to arrange your
% clothes so that they don’t float up into your face. The
% physical penalty can be increased to –20 for situa-
% tions involving combat skills and skills requiring fine
% manipulation, building, or repairing of items. These
% penalties will apply until the character adjusts, which
% typically takes about 3 days.

% Any biomorph with basic biomods (p. 300) is
% immune to ill health from the effects of long-term
% exposure to microgravity.

% MICROGRAVITY
% Microgravity includes both zero-G and gravities that
% are slightly higher but negligible. These conditions are
% found in space, on asteroids and some small moons,
% and on (parts of) spaceships and habitats that are not
% rotated for gravity. Objects in microgravity are effec-
% tively weightless, but size and mass are still factors.

% Things behave differently in microgravity. For
% example:

%  • Objects not anchored down will tend to drift

% off in whatever direction they were last moving.

% Floating objects will eventually settle in the direc-

% tion of the densest part of the habitat or spacecraft.
%  • Thrown or pushed items will travel in a straight

% line until they hit something.
%  • Smoke does not rise in streams. Instead, it forms

% a roughly spherical halo around its source.
%  • Liquids have little cohesion, scattering into clouds

% of tiny droplets if released into the air. Drinks

% come in sealed bulbs or bottles. Food is eaten so

% that sauces and bits of liquid don’t escape. Blood

% goes everywhere.


% Movement and maneuvering in microgravity is
% handled using Free Fall skill (p. 179). Most everyday
% activity in free fall does not require a test. The game-
% master can, however, call for a Free Fall Test for any
% complicated maneuvers, flying across major distances,
% sudden changes in direction or velocity, or when en-
% gaged in melee combat. A failed roll means the char-
% acter has miscalculated and ends up in a position other
% than intended. A Severe Failure means the character has
% screwed up badly, such as slamming themselves into a
% wall or sending themselves spinning off into space.

% For convenience, most microgravity habitats
% feature furniture covered with elastic loops, mesh
% pockets to keep individual objects from floating all
% over the place, and moving beltways with hand loops
% for major thoroughfares. Magnetic or velcro shoes
% are also used to walk around, rather than climbing
% or flying. Zero-g environments are often designed to
% make maximum use of space, however, taking advan-
% tage of the lack of ceilings and floors. Because object
% are weightless, characters can move even massive
% objects around easily.

% Movement Rate: Characters who are climbing, pull-
% ing, or pushing themselves along move at half their
% movement rate (p. 191) in microgravity.

% Terminal Velocity: It is not difficult to reach escape
% velocity on small asteroids and similar bodies—
% something to keep in mind with thrown objects and
% projectile weapons. In some cases, characters who
% move fast enough and jump can reach escape veloc-
% ity themselves, though these situations are left up to
% the gamemaster.

% LOW GRAVITY
% Low gravity includes anything from 0.5 g to micro-
% gravity. These conditions are found on Luna, Mars,
% Titan, and the rotating parts of most spun spacecraft
% and habitats. Low gravity is not that different from
% standard gravity, though characters may jump twice as
% far and thrown/projectile objects have a longer range
% (p. 203). Increase the running rate for characters in
% low gravity by x1.5.

% HIGH GRAVITY
% High gravity is anything significantly stronger than
% standard Earth gravity (1.2 g +). High gravity in
% Eclipse Phase is typically only found on exoplanets.
% High gravity can be particularly hard on characters
% as their bodies are strained because they carry more
% weights, muscles are fatigued from needing to push
% more around, and the heart must work harder to
% pump blood. For every 0.2 g over 1 that a character is
% not acclimated to, treat it as if the character is suffer-
% ing from the effects of 1 wound. At the gamemaster’s
% discretion, movement rates may also be modified.

% GRENADES AND SEEKERS
% Modern grenades, seekers, and similar explosives do
% not necessarily detonate the instant they are thrown
% or strike the target. In fact, several trigger options
% are available, each set by the user when deploying
% the weapon. Missed attacks, or attacks that do not
% explode in transit or when they strike, are subject to
% scatter (p. 204).

% Airburst: Airburst means that the device explodes in
% mid-air as soon as it travels a distance programmed at
% launch. In this case, the explosive’s effects are resolved
% immediately, in that user’s Action Phase. Note that
% airburst munitions are programmed with a safety fea-
% ture that will prevent detonation if they fail to travel
% a minimum precautionary distance from the launcher,
% though this can be overridden.

% Impact: The grenade or missile goes off as soon as it
% hits something, whether that be the target, ground, or

% %%% txt/202.txt
% an intervening object. Resolve the effects immediately,
% in the user’s Action Phase.

% Signal: The munition is primed for detonation upon
% receiving a command signal via wireless link. The
% device simply lays in wait until it receives the proper
% signal (which must include the cryptographic key
% assigned when the grenade was primed), detonating
% immediately when it does.

% Timer: The device has a built-in timer allowing
% the user to adjust exactly when it detonates. This
% can be anywhere from 1 second to days, months, or
% even years later, effectively using the device like a
% bomb, but also increasing the likelihood it will be
% discovered and neutralized. The minimum detona-
% tion period—1 second—means that the munition will
% detonate on the user’s (current) Initiative Score in the
% next Action Phase. A 2-second delay would last two
% Action Phases, a 3-second delay three Action phases,
% and so on.

% THROWING BACK GRENADES
% It is possible that a character may be able to reach
% a grenade before it detonates and throw it back (or
% away in a safe direction). The character must be
% within movement range of the grenade’s location, and
% must take a Complex Action to make a REF + COO +
% COO Test to catch the rolling, sliding grenade. If they
% succeed, they may throw the grenade off in a direc-
% tion of their choice with the same action (treat as a
% standard throwing attack).

% If the character fails the test, however, they may find
% themselves at ground zero when it detonates.

% JUMPING ON
% Given the possibility of resleeving, a character may
% decide to take one for the team and throw themselves
% on a grenade, sacrificing themselves in order to protect
% others. The character must be within movement range
% of the grenade’s location, and must take a Complex
% Action to make a REF + COO + WIL Test to fall on
% the grenade and cover it with their morph. This means
% the character suffers an extra 1d10 damage when the
% grenade detonates. On the positive side, the grenade’s
% damage is reduced by the sacrificing character’s armor
% + 10 when its damage effects are applied to others
% within the blast radius.

% If the gamemaster feels it appropriate, a WIL x 3
% Test might be called for in order for a character to
% sacrifice themselves in this manner.

% HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS

% The solar system might be friendly to life on a grand
% scale, but if you’re stranded in the gravity well of Jupi-
% ter during a magnetic storm, trying to breathe without
% a respirator on Mars, or swimming in hard vacuum
% without a space suit, it doesn’t seem so friendly. This
% section describes a few of the hostile environments
% that characters in Eclipse Phase might face.
% ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINATION
% Habitats sometimes fall ill. The effects of a habitat
%  suffering from ecological imbalance or out-of-control
% pathogens can range from mildly allergenic habitat
% atmospheres to rampaging environmental sepsis.
% Characters without breathing or filtration gear in a
%  contaminated environment should suffer penalties
% to physical and possibly social skills, ranging from
% –10 (mild contamination) to –30 (severely septic at-
% mosphere). Depending on the contamination, other
%  effects may apply, as the gamemaster sees fit.

% EXTREME HEAT AND COLD
% Planetary environments can range from the extremely
% hot (Venus, Mercury’s day side) to the extremely frigid
% (Neptune, Titan, Uranus). Both are likely to kill an un-
% protected and unmodified biomorph within minutes, if
% not seconds. Synthmorphs and vehicles fare better, es-
% pecially in the cold, but even they are likely to quickly
% succumb to the blazing furnaces of the inner planets
% without strong heat shields and cooling systems.

% EXTREME PRESSURE

% Similarly, the atmospheric pressures of Jupiter,
% Saturn, and Venus quickly become crushingly deadly
% anywhere beyond the upper levels. Only synthmorphs
% and vehicles with special pressure adaptations can
% hope to survive such depths.

% GRAVITY TRANSITION ZONES

% The widespread use of artificial gravity in space
% habitats means that characters will often encounter
% places where the direction of down suddenly changes.
% In most rotating habitats, the standard design in-
% cludes an axial zone where spacecraft can dock in
% microgravity and a carefully designed and marked
% transition zone (usually an elevator) where people and
% cargo coming and going from the axial spaceport can
% orient to local “down” and be standing in the right
% place when gravity takes effect. Gravity transitions in
% rotating habitats are almost always gradual but can
% be very dangerous if a character encounters them in
% the wrong place or time.

% A character cast adrift in the microgravity zone at
% the axis of a rotating space habitat will slowly drift
% outward until they begin to encounter gravity, at
% which point they will fall. How long this takes varies
% on the size of the habitat. A good rule of thumb is that
% for each kilometer of diameter possessed by the habi-
% tat, the character has 30 seconds before they begin to
% fall. If the character was given a good push out from
% the axis when set adrift, this time should be halved,
% quartered, or more at the gamemaster’s discretion.

% MAGNETIC FIELDS
% Magnetism isn’t a direct problem for most characters;
% transhumans need to worry more about the radiation
% generated by a powerful magnetosphere. For un-
% shielded electronic devices and similarly unshielded
% transhumans sporting titanium, however, the effects

% %%% txt/203.txt
% of strong magnetic fields can be devastating. Note that
% many of the conditions that result in vehicles, bots,
% and gear being exposed to strong magnetic field activ-
% ity coincide with strong radioactivity.

% Magnetic fields affect synthmorphs, robots, vehicles,
% cybernetic implants, and electronics after 1 minute of
% exposure. Like radiation exposure, these effects can
% vary drastically. At the low end, communication and
% sensors will suffer interference and shortened ranges;
% at high ends, electronic systems will simply suffer
% damage and fail.

% RADIATION
% Ionizing radiation is one of the more prevalent haz-
% ards in the solar system and one of the most difficult
% problems for transhumanity to defeat. Radiation
% damages genetic material, sickens, and kills by ion-
% izing the chemicals involved in cell division within the
% human body. Effects range from nausea and fatigue to
% massive organ failure and death. However, radiation
% sickness is not solely a somatic phenomenon. The real
% terror of radiation for transhumans, especially at high
% dose levels such as those experienced on the surface of
% Ganymede and other Jovian moons, is damage to the
% neural network. This can lead to flawed uploads and
% backups. Nanomedicine that can rapidly reverse the
% ionization of cellular chemicals and new materials that
% offer thinner and better shielding help, but the sheer
% magnitude of the radiation put out by some bodies in
% the solar system defeats even these.

% Radiation poisoning is a complicated affair, and de-
% tailed rules are beyond the scope of this book. Sources
% of radiation include the Earth’s Van Allen belt, Jupi-
% ter’s radiation belt, Saturn’s magnetosphere, cosmic
% rays, solar flares, fission materials, unshielded fusion
% or antimatter explosions, and nuclear blasts, among
% others. Effects can vary drastically depending on the
% strength of the source, the amount of time exposed,
% and the level of shielding available. The immediate
% effects on biomorphs (manifesting anywhere from
% within minutes to 6 hours) can include nausea, vomit-
% ing, fatigue (reduced SOM), as well as both physical
% damage and minor amounts of mental stress. This
% is followed by a latency period where the biomorph
% seems to get better, lasting anywhere from 6 hours
% to 2 weeks. After this point, the final effects kick in,
% which can include hair loss, sterility, reduced SOM
% and DUR, severe damage to gastric and intestinal
% tissue, infections, uncontrolled bleeding, and death.

% Synthmorphs are not quite as vulnerable as
% biomorphs, but even they can be damaged and dis-
% abled by severe radiation dosages.

% TOXIC ATMOSPHERE
% Neptune, Titan, Uranus, and Venus all have toxic
% atmospheres. Similar atmospheres may be found on
% some exoplanets, or might be intentionally created as
% a security measure within a habitat or structure.

% A character who is unaware of atmospheric toxicity
% and does not immediately hold their breath (requir-
% ing a REF x 3 Test) suffers 10 points of damage per
% Action Turn. A character who manages to hold their
% breath can last a bit longer; apply the rules for as-
% phyxiation (p. 194).

% Corrosive Atmospheres: In addition to being toxic,
% Venus has the only naturally occurring corrosive at-
% mosphere in the system. Corrosive atmospheres are
% immediately dangerous: characters take 10 points of
% damage per Action Turn, regardless of whether they
% hold their breath or not. Corrosive atmospheres also
% damage vehicles and gear not equipped with anti-
% corrosive shielding. Such items take 1 point of damage
% per minute. At greater concentrations, such as in the
% dense sulfuric acid clouds in the upper atmosphere of
% Venus, items takes 5 points of damage per minute.

% UNBREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE
% Very few of the planetary bodies in the solar system
% actually have toxic atmospheres. In most unbreathable
% atmospheres, the primary hazard for transhumans
% without breathing apparatus or modifications to their
% morph is lack of oxygen. Treat exposure to unbreath-
% able atmospheres the same as asphyxiation.

% UNDERWATER
% In general, any physical skill performed underwater suf-
% fers a –20 penalty due to the resistance of the medium.
% Skills relying on equipment not adapted for underwa-
% ter use may be more difficult or impossible to use. A
% character’s movement rate while swimming or walking
% underwater is one quarter their normal rate on land.
% If a character begins to drown underwater, follow the
% rules for asphyxiation (p. 194). Note that drowning
% characters do not immediately recover if rescued from
% the water; they will continue to asphyxiate until medical
% treatment is applied to clear the water from their lungs.

% VACUUM

% Biomorphs without vacuum sealing (p. 305) can
% spend one minute in the vacuum of space with no ill
% effects, provided they curl up into a ball, empty their
% lungs of air, and keep their eyes closed (something kids
% in space habitats learn at a very young age). Contrary
% to popular depictions in pre-Fall media, a character
% exposed to hard vacuum does not explosively de-
% compress, nor do their internal fluids boil (other than
% relatively exposed liquids such as saliva on the tongue).
% Rather, the primary danger for characters on EVA sans
% vacsuit is asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen and as-
% sociated complications such as edema in the lungs.

% After one minute in space, the character begins to
% suffer from asphyxiation (p. 194). Damage is doubled
% if the character tries to hold air in their lungs or is not
% curled up in a vacuum survival position as described
% above. Additionally, characters trapped in space with-
% out adequate thermal protection suffer 10 points of
% damage per minute from the extreme cold.

%  IMPROVISED WEAPONS
%  Sometimes characters are caught off-guard and they
%  must use whatever they happen to have at hand as
%  a weapon—or they think they look cool wailing on
%  someone with a meter of chain. The Improvised Weap-
%  ons table offers statistics for a few likely ad-hoc items.
%  Gamemasters can use these as guidelines for handling
%  items that aren’t listed.

%  KNOCKDOWN/KNOCKBACK
%  If an attacker’s intent is to simply knock an opponent
%  down or back in melee, rather than injure them, roll
%  the attack and defense as normal. If the attacker suc-
%  ceeds, the defender is knocked backward by 1 meter
%  per 10 full points of MoS. To knock an opponent
%  down, the attacker must score an Excellent Success
%  (MoS 30+). A knockback/knockdown attack must be
%  declared before dice are rolled.

%  Unless the attacker rolls a critical success, no
%  damage is inflicted with this attack, the defender is
%  simply knocked down. If the attacker rolls a critical
%  hit, however, apply damage as normal in addition to
%  the knockback/knockdown.

%  Note that characters wounded by an attack may
%  also be knocked down (see Wound Effects, p. 207).

%  MELEE AND THROWN DAMAGE BONUS
%  Every successful melee and thrown weapon attack,
%  whether unarmed or with a weapon, receives a damage
%  bonus equal to the attacker’s SOM ÷ 10, round down.
%  See Damage Bonus, p. 123.

%  MULTIPLE TARGETS
%  When doling out the damage, there’s no reason not to
%  share the love.

%  MELEE COMBAT
%  A character taking a Complex Action to engage in a
%  melee attack may choose to attack two or more op-
%  ponents with the same action. Each opponent must be
%  within one meter of another attacked opponent. These
%  attacks must be declared before the dice are rolled for
%  the first attack. Each attack suffers a cumulative –20
%  modifier for each extra target. So if a character declares
%  they are going to attack three characters with the same
%  action, they suffer a cumulative –60 on each attack.

%  RANGED COMBAT


% A character firing two semi-auto shots with a Complex


% Action may target a different opponent with each shot.


% In this case, the attacker suffers a –20 modifier against


% the second target.


%    A character firing a burst-fire weapon may target up


% to two targets with each burst, as long as those targets


% are within one meter of one another. This is handled


% as a single attack; see Burst Fire, p. 198.


%    A character firing a burst-fire weapon twice with


% one Complex Action may target a different person or


% pair with each burst. In this case, the second burst


% suffers a –20 modifier. This modifier does not apply


% if the same person/pair targeted with the first burst is


% targeted again.


%    Full-auto attacks may also be directed at more than


% one target, as long as each target is within one meter


% of the previous target. This is handled as a single


% attack; see Full Auto, p. 198.



%  OBJECTS AND STRUCTURES


% As any poor wall in the vicinity of an enraged drunk


% can tell you, objects and structures are not immune


% to violence and attrition. To reflect this, inanimate


% objects and structures are given Durability, Wound


% Threshold, and Armor scores, just like characters. Du-


% rability measures how much damage the structure can


% take before it is destroyed. Armor reduces the damage


% inflicted by attacks, as normal. For simplicity, a single


% Armor rating is given that counts as both Energy and


% Kinetic armor; at the gamemaster’s discretion, these


% may be modified as appropriate.


%   Wounds suffered by objects and structures do not have


% the same effect as wounds inflicted on characters. Each


% wound is simply treated as a hole, partial demolition, or


% impaired function, as the gamemaster sees fit. Alternately,


% a wounded device may function less effectively, and so


% may inflict a negative modifier on skill tests made while


% using that object (a cumulative –10 per wound).


%    In the case of large structures, it is recommended


% that individual parts of the structure be treated as


% separate entities for the purpose of inflicting damage.



%  RANGED ATTACKS

% damage (round down) on large structures such

%  ranged attacks simply penetrate the structure, leaving

% Agonizers and stunners have no effect on objects
%  and structures.

%  SHOOTING THROUGH
%  If a character attempts to shoot through an object or
%  structure at a target on the other side, the attack is
%  likely to suffer a blind fire modifier of at least –30
%  unless the attack has some way of viewing the target.
%  On top of this, the target receives an armor bonus
%  equal to the object/structure’s Armor rating x 2.

%  RANGE
% Every type of ranged weapon has a limited range,
% beyond which it is ineffective. The effective range of
% the weapon is further broken down into four catego-
% ries: Short, Medium, Long, and Extreme. A modifier
% is applied for each category, as noted on the Combat
% Modifiers table, p. 193.

% For examples of specific weapon ranges, see the
% Weapon Ranges table.

%  RANGE, GRAVITY, AND VACUUM
%  The ranges listed on the Weapon Ranges table are for
%  Earth-like gravity conditions (1 g). While the effective
%  ranges of kinetic, seeker, spray, and thrown weapons
%  can potentially increase in lower gravity environments
%  due to lack of gravitational forces or aerodynamic
%  drag, accuracy is still the defining factor for determin-
%  ing whether you hit or miss a target. In lower gravi-
%  ties, use the same effective ranges listed, but extend
%  the maximum range by dividing it by the gravity (for
%  example, a max range of 100 meters would be 200
%  meters in 0.5 g). In microgravity and zero g, the maxi-
%  mum range is effectively line of sight. Likewise, under
%  high-gravity conditions (over 1 g), divide each range
%  category maximum by the gravity (e.g., a short range
%  of 10 meters would be 5 meters in 2 g).

%  Beam weapons are not affected by gravity, but they
%  do fare much better in non-atmospheric conditions.
%  Maximum beam weapon range in vacuum is effec-
%  tively line of sight.

% REACH
% Some weapons extend a character’s reach, giving
% them a significant advantage over an opponent in
% melee combat. This applies to any weapon over half
% a meter long: axes, clubs, swords, shock batons, etc.
% Whenever one character has a reach advantage over
% another, they receive a +10 modifier for both attacking
% and defending.

% SCATTER
% When you are using a blast weapon, you may still
% catch your target in the blast radius even if you fail to
% hit them directly. Weapons such as grenades must go
% somewhere when they miss, and exactly where they
% land may be important to the outcome of a battle. To
% determine where a missed blast attack falls, the scatter
% rules are called into play.

% To determine scatter, roll a d10 and note where the
% die “points” (using yourself as the reference point).
% This is the direction from the target that the missed
% blast lands. The die roll also determines how far away
% the blast lands, in meters. If the MoF on the attack is
% over 30, this distance is doubled. If the MoF exceeds
% 60, the distance is tripled. This point determines the
% epicenter of the blast; resolve the effects of damage
% against anyone caught within its sphere of effect as
% normal (see Blast Effect, p. 193).

% SHOCK ATTACKS
% Shock weapons use high-voltage electrical jolts to
% physically stun and incapacitate targets. Shock weap-
% ons are particularly effective against biomorphs and
% pods, even when heavily armored. Synthmorphs, bots,
% and vehicles are immune to shock weapon effects.

% A biomorph struck with a shock weapon must
% make a DUR + Energy Armor Test (using their cur-
% rent DUR score, reduced by damage they have taken).
% If they fail, they immediately lose neuromuscular
%  control, fall down, and are incapacitated for 1 Action
% Turn per 10 full points of MoF (minimum of 3 Action
% Turns). During this time they are stunned and inca-
% pable of taking any action, possibly convulsing, suf-
% fering vertigo, nausea, etc. After this period, they may
% act but they remain stunned and shaken, suffering a
% –30 modifier to all actions. This modifier reduces by
% 10 per minute (so –20 after 1 minute, –10 after 2 min-
% utes, and no modifier after 3 minutes). Many shock
% weapons also inflict DV, which is handled as normal.

% A biomorph that succeeds the DUR Test is still
% shocked but not incapacitated. They suffer half the
% listed DV and suffer a –30 modifier until the end of
% the next Action Turn. This modifier reduces by 10 per
% Action Turn. Modifiers from additional shocks are
% not cumulative, but will boost the modifier back to
% its maximum value.

% SUBDUAL
% To grapple an opponent in melee combat, you must
% declare your intent to subdue before making the die
% roll. Any appropriate melee skill may be used for the
% attack; if wielding a weapon, it may be used as part of
% the grappling technique. If you succeed in your attack
% with an Excellent Success (MoS of 30+), you have suc-
% cessfully subdued your opponent (for the moment, at
% least). Grappling attacks do not cause damage unless
% you roll a critical success (though even in this case you
% can choose not to).

% A subdued opponent is temporarily restrained or
% immobilized. They may communicate, use mental
% skills, and take mesh actions, but they may not take
% any physical actions other than trying to break free.
% (At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may make small,
% restrained physical actions, such as reaching for a
% knife in their pocket or grabbing an item dropped a
% few centimeters away on the floor, but these actions
% should suffer at least a –30 modifier and may be no-
% ticed by their grappler).

% To break free, a grappled character must take a
% Complex Action and succeed in either an Opposed
% Unarmed Combat Test or an Opposed SOM x 3 Test,
% though the subdued character suffers a –30 modifier
% on this test.

% SUPPRESSIVE FIRE
% A character firing a weapon in full-auto mode (p. 198)
% may choose to lay down suppressive fire over an area
% rather than targeting anyone specifically, with the
% intent of making everyone in the suppressed area keep
% their heads down. This takes a Complex Action, uses
% up 20 shots, and lasts until the character’s next Action
% Phase. The suppressed area extends out in a cone, with
% the widest diameter of the cone being up to 20 meters
% across. Any character who is not behind cover or who
% does not immediately move behind cover on their
% action is at risk of getting hit by the suppressive fire. If
% they move out of cover inside the suppressed area, the
% character laying down suppressive fire gets one free
% attack against them, which they may defend against
% as normal. Apply no modifiers to these tests except
% for range, wounds, and full defense. If hit, the struck
% character must resist damage as if from a single shot.

% SURPRISE
% Characters who wish to ambush another must seek to
% gain the advantage of surprise. This typically means
% sneaking up on, lying in wait, or sniping from a hard-
% to-perceive position in the distance. Any time an am-
% busher (or group of ambushers) attempts to surprise a

% %%% txt/207.txt
% target (or group of targets), make a secret Perception
% Test for the ambushee(s). Unless they are alert for sur-
% prises, this test should suffer the typical –20 modifier
% for being distracted. This is an Opposed Test against
% the ambusher(s) Infiltration skill. Depending on the
% attacker’s position, other modifiers may also apply
% (distance, visibility, cover, etc.).

% If the Perception Test fails, the character is surprised
% by the attack and cannot react to or defend against it. In
% this case, simply give the attacker(s) a free Action Phase
% to attack the surprised character(s). Once the attackers
% have taken their actions, roll Initiative as normal.

% If the Perception Test succeeds, the character is
% alerted to something a split-second before they are
% ambushed, giving them a chance to react. In this case,
% roll Initiative as normal, but the ambushed character(s)
% suffers a –30 modifier to the Initiative Test. The am-
% bushed character may still defend as normal.

% In a group situation, things can get more compli-
% cated when some characters are surprised and others
% aren’t. In this case, roll Initiative as normal, with all
% non-ambushers suffering the –30 modifier. Any charac-
% ters who are surprised are simply unable to take action
% on the first Action Phase, as they are caught off-guard
% and must take a moment to assess what’s going on
% and get caught up with the action. As above, surprised
% characters my not defend on this first Action Phase.

% TACTICAL NETWORKS
% Tactical networks are specialized software programs
% used by teams that benefit from the sharing of tacti-
% cal data. They are commonly used by sports teams,
% security outfits, military units, AR gamers, gatecrash-
% ers, surveyors, miners, traffic control, scavengers, and
% anyone else who needs a tactical overview of a situa-
% tion. Firewall teams regularly take advantage of them.

% In game terms, tacnets provide specialized software
% skills and tools to a muse or AI, as best fits their tac-
% tical needs. These tools link together and share and
% analyze data between all of the participants in the
% network, creating a customizable entoptics display for
% each user that summarizes relevant data, highlights
% interactions and priorities, and alerts the user to mat-
% ters that require their attention.
% COMBAT TACNETS
% The following list is a sample of a typical combat tacnet’s
% features. Gamemasters are encouraged to modify and
% expand these options as appropriate to their game:


% • Maps: Tacnets assemble all available maps and

%  can present them to the user with a bird’s eye

%  view or as a three-dimensional interactive, with

%  distances between relevant features readily acces-

%  sible. The AI or muse can also plot maps based

%  on sensory input, breadcrumb positioning sys-

%  tems (p. 332), and other data. Plotted paths and

%  other data from these maps can be displayed as

%  entoptic images or other AR sensory input (e.g.,

%  a user who should be turning left might see a

%  transparent red arrow or feel a tingling sensation

%  on their left side).

% • Positioning: The exact positioning of the user and

%  all other participants are updated and mapped

%  according to mesh positioning and GPS. Likewise,

%  the positioning of known people, bots, vehicles,

%  and other features can also be plotted according

%  to sensory input.

% • Sensory Input: Any sensory input available to a

%  participating character or device in the network

%  can be fed into the system and shared. This

%  includes data from cybernetic senses, portable

%  sensors, smartlink guncams, XP output, etc. This

%  allows one user to immediately call up and access

%  the sensor feed of another user.

% • Communications Management: The tacnet

%  maintains an encrypted link between all users

%  and stays wary both of participants who drop

%  out or of attempts to hack or interfere with the

%  communications link.

% • Smartlink/Weapon Data: The tacnet monitors the

%  status of weapons, accessories, and other gear via

%  the smartlink interface or wireless link, bringing

%  damage, shortages, and other issues to the user’s

%  attention.

% • Indirect Fire: Members of a tacnet can provide

%  targeting data to each other for purposes of indi-

%  rect fire (p. 195).

% • Analysis: The muses and AIs participating in

%  the tacnet are bolstered with skill software and

% %%% txt/208.txt


% databases that enable them to interpret incom-


% ing data and sensory feeds. Perhaps the most


% useful aspect of tacnets, this means that the


% muse/AI may notice facts or details individual


% users are likely to have overlooked. For example,


% the tacnet can count shots fired by opponents,


% note when they are likely running low, and


% even analyze sensory input to determine the


% type of weaponry and ammunition being used.


% Opponents and their gear can also be scanned


% and analyzed to note potential weaknesses, in-


% juries, and capabilities. If sensor contact with


% an opponent is lost, the last known location is


% memorized and potential movement vectors and


% distances are displayed. Opponent positioning


% can also identify lines of sight and fields of fire,


% alerting the user to areas of potential cover or


% danger. The tacnet can also suggest tactical ma-


% neuvers that will aid the user, such as flanking an


% opponent or acquiring better elevation.


% Many of these features are immediately accessible
% to the user via their AR display; other data can be ac-
% cessed with a Quick Action. Likewise, the gamemaster
% decides when the muse/AI provides important alerts to
% the user. At the gamemaster’s discretion, some of these
% features may apply modifiers to the character’s tests.

% TOUCH-ONLY ATTACK
% Some types of attacks simply require you to touch your
% target, rather than injure them, and are correspond-
% ingly easier. This might apply when trying to slap them
% with a dermal drug patch, spreading a contact poison
% on their skin, or making skin-to-skin contact for the
% use of a psi sleight. In situations like this, apply a +20
% modifier to your melee attacks.

% TWO-HANDED WEAPONS
% Any weapon noted as two-handed requires two hands
% (or other prehensile limbs) to wield effectively. This
% applies to some archaic melee weapons (large swords,
% spears, etc.) in addition to certain larger firearms and
% heavy weapons. Any character that attempts to use
% such a weapon single-handed suffers a –20 modifier.

% WIELDING TWO OR MORE WEAPONS
% It is possible for a character to wield two weapons
% in combat, or even more if they are an octomorph or
% multi-limbed synthmorph. In this case, each weapon
% that is held in an off-hand suffers a –20 off-hand
% weapon modifier. This modifier may be offset with the
% Ambidextrous trait (p. 145).

% EXTRA MELEE WEAPONS
% The use of two or more melee weapons is treated as
% a single attack, rather than multiple. Each additional
% weapon applies +1d10 damage to the attack (up to a
% maximum +3d10). If the character attacks multiple
% targets with the same Complex Action (see Mul-
% tiple Targets, p. 202), this bonus does not apply. The
% attacker must, of course, be capable of actually wield-
% ing the additional weapons. A splicer with only two
% hands cannot wield a knife and a two-handed sword,
% for example. Likewise, the gamemaster may ignore
% this damage bonus for extra weapons that are too dis-
% similar to use together effectively (like a whip and a
% pool cue). Note that extra limbs do not count as extra
% weapons in unarmed combat, nor do weapons that
% come as a pair (such as shock gloves).

% A character using more than one melee weapon
% receives a bonus for defending against melee attacks
% equal to +10 per extra weapon  (maximum +30).

% EXTRA RANGED WEAPONS
% Similarly, an attacker can wield a pistol in each hand
% for ranged combat, or larger weapons if they have
% more limbs (an eight-limbed octomorph, for example,
% could conceivably hold four assault rifles). These
% weapons may all be fired at once towards the same
% target. In this case, each weapon is handled as a sepa-
% rate attack, with each off-hand weapon suffering a
% cumulative off-hand weapon modifier (no modifier for
% the first attack, –20 for the second, –40 for the third,
% and –60 for the fourth), offset by the Ambidextrous
% trait (p. 145) as usual.



% PHYSICAL HEALTH
% In a setting as dangerous as Eclipse Phase, characters
% are inevitably going to get hurt. Whether your morph
% is biological or synthetic, you can be injured by weap-
% ons, brawling, falling, accidents, extreme environ-
% ments, psi attacks, and so on. This section discusses
% how to track such injuries and determine what effect
% they have on your character. Two methods are used
% to gauge a character’s physical health: damage points
% and wounds.

% DAMAGE POINTS
% Any physical harm that befalls your character is mea-
% sured in damage points. These points are cumulative,
% and are recorded on your character sheet. Damage
% points are characterized as fatigue, stun, bruises,
% bumps, sprains, minor cuts, and similar hurts that,
% while painful, do not significantly impair or threaten
% your character’s life unless they accumulate to a signif-
% icant amount. Any source of harm that inflicts a large
% amount of damage points at once, however, is likely to
% have a more severe effect (see Wounds, p. 207).

% Damage points may be reduced by rest, medical
% care, and/or repair (see Healing and Repair, p. 208).

% DAMAGE TYPES
% Physical damage comes in three forms: Energy, Kinetic,
% and Psi.

% ENERGY DAMAGE
% Energy damage includes lasers, plasma guns, fire, electro-
% cution, explosions, and others sources of damaging energy.

% %%% txt/209.txt
% KINETIC DAMAGE
% Kinetic damage is caused by projectiles and other
% objects moving at great speeds that disperse their
% energy into the target upon impact. Kinetic attacks
% include slug-throwers, flechette weapons, knives, and
% punches.

% PSI DAMAGE
% Psi damage is caused by offensive psi sleights like
% Psychic Stab (p. 228).

% DURABILITY AND HEALTH
% Your character’s physical health is measured by their
% Durability stat. For characters sleeved in biomorphs,
% this figure represents the point at which accumu-
% lated damage points overwhelm your character and
% they fall unconscious. Once you have accumulated
% damage points equal to or exceeding your Durability
% stat, you immediately collapse from exhaustion and
% physical abuse. You remain unconscious and may
% not be revived until your damage points are reduced
% below your Durability, either from medical care or
% natural healing.

% If you are morphed in a synthetic shell, Durabil-
% ity represents your structural integrity. You become
% physically disabled when accumulated damage points
% reach your Durability. Though your computer systems
% are likely still functioning and you can still mesh, your
% morph is broken and immobile until repaired.

% DEATH
% An extreme accumulation of damage points can
% threaten your character’s life. If the damage reaches
% your Durability x 1.5 (for biomorphs) or Durability x
% 2 (for synthetic morphs), your body dies. This known
% as your Death Rating. Synthetic morphs that reach
% this state are destroyed beyond repair.

% DAMAGE VALUE
% Weapons (and other sources of injury) in Eclipse
% Phase have a listed Damage Value (DV)—the base
% amount of damage points the weapon inflicts. This is
% often presented as a variable amount, in the form of a
% die roll; for example: 3d10. In this case, you roll three
% ten-sided dice and add up the results (counting 0 as
% 10). Sometimes the DV will be presented as a dice roll
% plus modifier; for example: 2d10 + 5. In this case you
% roll two ten-sided dice, add them together, and then
% add 5 to get the result.

% For simplicity, a static amount is also noted in
% parentheses after the variable amount. If you prefer
% to skip the dice rolling, you can just apply the static
% amount (usually close to the mean average) instead.
% For example, if the damage were noted 2d10 + 5 (15),
% you could simply apply 15 damage points instead of
% rolling dice.

% When damage is inflicted on a character, determine the
% DV (roll the dice) and subtract the modified armor value,
% as noted under Step 7: Determine Damage (p. 192).
% WOUNDS
% Wounds represent more grievous injuries: bad cuts and
% hemorrhaging, fractures and breaks, mangled limbs,
% and other serious damage that impairs your ability to
% function and may lead to death or long-term damage.

% Any time your character sustains damage, compare
% the amount inflicted (after it has been reduced by
% armor) to your Wound Threshold. If the modified DV
% equals or exceeds your Wound Threshold, you have
% suffered a wound. If the inflicted damage is double
% your Wound Threshold, you suffer 2 wounds; if
% triple your Wound Threshold, you suffer 3 wounds;
% and so on.

% Wounds are cumulative, and must be marked on
% your character sheet.

% Note that these rules handle damage and wounds
% as an abstract concept. For drama and realism,
% gamemasters may wish to describe wounds in more
% detailed and grisly terms: a broken ankle, a severed
% tendon, internal bleeding, a lost ear, and so on. The
% nature of such descriptive injuries may help the game-
% master assign other effects. For example, a character
% with a crushed hand may not be able to pick up a gun,
% someone with excessive blood loss may leave a trail
% for their enemies to follow, or someone with a cut eye
% may suffer an additional visual perception modifier.
% Likewise, such details may impact how a character is
% treated or heals.

% WOUND EFFECTS
% Each wound applies a cumulative –10 modifier to all
% of the character’s actions. A character with 3 wounds,
% for example, suffers –30 to all actions.

% Some traits, morphs, implants, drugs, and psi allow
% a character to ignore wound modifiers. These effects
% are cumulative, though the maximum amount of
% wound modifiers that may be negated is –30.

% Knockdown: Any time a character takes a wound,
% they must make an immediate SOM x 3 Test. Wound
% modifiers apply. If they fail, they are knocked down
% and must expend a Quick Action to get back up. Bots
% and vehicles must make a Pilot Test to avoid crashing.

% Unconsciousness: Any time a character receives 2
% or more wounds at once (from the same attack), they
% must also make an immediate SOM x 3 Test; wound
% modifiers again apply. If they fail, they have been
% knocked unconscious. Bots and vehicles that take 2 or
% more wounds at once automatically crash (see Crash-
% ing, p. 196).

% Bleeding: Any biomorph character who has suffered
% a wound and who takes damage that exceeds their
% Durability is in danger of bleeding to death. They
% incur 1 additional damage point per Action Turn (20
% per minute) until they receive medical care or die.

% DEATH
% For many people in Eclipse Phase, death is not the end
% of the line. If the character’s cortical stack can be re-
% trieved, they can be resurrected and downloaded into
% a new morph (see Resleeving, p. 271). This typically

% %%% txt/210.txt
%  requires either backup insurance (p. 269) or the good
%  graces of whomever ends up with their body/stack.

%  If the cortical stack is not retrievable, the character
%  still be re-instantiated from an archived backup (p.
%  268). Again, this either requires backup insurance or
%  someone who is willing to pay to have them revived.

%  If the character’s cortical stack is not retrieved
%  and they have no backup, then they are completely
%  and utterly dead. Gone. Kaput. (Unless they happen
%  to have an alpha fork of themselves floating around
%  somewhere; see Forking and Merging, p. 273.)



%  HEALING AND REPAIR
%  Use the follow rules for healing and repairing dam-
%  aged and wounded characters.

%  BIOMORPH HEALING
%  Thanks to advanced medical technologies, there are
%  many ways for characters in biological morphs (in-
%  cluding pods) to heal injuries. Medichine nanoware
%  (p. 308) helps characters to heal quickly, as do nano-
%  bandages (p. 333). Healing vats (p. 326) will heal even
%  the most grievous wounds in a matter of days, and
%  can even restore characters who recently died or have
%  been reduced to just a head.

% Characters without access to these medical tools are
%  not without hope, of course. The medical skills of a
%  trained professional can abate the impact of wounds,
%  and over time bodies will of course heal themselves.

%  MEDICAL CARE
%  Characters with an appropriate Medicine skill (such
%  as Medicine: Paramedic or Medicine: Trauma Sur-
%  gery) can perform first aid on damaged or wounded
%  characters. A successful Medicine Test, modified as
%  the gamemaster deems fit according to situational
%  conditions, will heal 1d10 points of damage and will
%  remove 1 wound. This test must be made within 24
%  hours of the injury, and any particular injury may only
%  be treated once. If the character is later injured again,
%  however, this new damage may also be treated. Medi-
%  cal care of this sort is not effective against injuries that
%  have been treated with medichines, nanobandages, or
%  healing vats.

% NATURAL HEALING

% Characters trapped far from medical technology—in

% a remote station, the wilds of Mars, or the like—may

% be forced to heal naturally if injured. Natural healing

% is a slow process that’s heavily influenced by a number

% of factors. In order for a character to heal wounds,

% all normal damage must be healed first. Consult the

% Healing table.


% SURGERY
%  In Eclipse Phase, most grievous injuries can be han-
%  dled by time in a healing vat (p. 326) or simply rest
%  and recovery. In circumstances where a healing vat is
%  not available, the gamemaster may decide that a par-
%  ticular wound requires actual surgery from an intelli-
%  gent being (whether a character or AI-driven medbot).
%  Usually in this case the character will be incapable of
%  further healing until the surgery occurs. The surgery
%  is handled as a Medical Test using a field appropriate
%  to the situation and with a timeframe of 1–8 hours. If
%  successful, the character is healed of 1d10 damage and
%  1 wound and recovers from that point on as normal.


% SYNTHMORPH AND OBJECT REPAIR

% Unlike biomorphs, synthetic morphs and objects do not

% heal damage on their own and must be repaired. Some

% synthmorphs and devices have advanced nanotech self-

% repair systems, similar to medichines for biomorphs (see

% Fixers, p. 329). Repair spray (p. 333) may also be used

% to conduct fixes and is an extremely useful option for

% non-technical people. Barring these options, technicians

% may also work repairs the old-fashioned way, using

% their skills and tools (see Physical Repairs, below). As a

% last resort, synthmorphs and objects may be repaired in

% a nanofabrication machine with the appropriate blue-

% prints (using the same rules as healing vats, p. 326).


% PHYSICAL REPAIRS

% Manually fixing a synthmorph or object requires a

% Hardware Test using a field appropriate to the item

% (Hardware: Robotics for synthmorphs and bots,

% Hardware: Aerospace for aircraft, etc.), with a –10

% modifier per wound. Repair is a Task Action with

% a timeframe of 2 hours per 10 points of damage

% being restored, plus 8 hours per wound. Appropriate

% Armor may be repaired in the same manner as Dura-

% MENTAL HEALTH

% In a time when people can discard bodies and
% replace them with new ones, trauma inflicted on
% your mind and ego—your sense of self—is often
% more frightening than grievous physical harm. There
% are many ways in which your sanity and mental
% wholeness can be threatened: experiencing physical
% death, extended isolation, loss of loved ones, alien
% situations, discontinuity of self from lost memories
% or switching morphs, psi attack, and so on. Two
% methods are used to gauge your mental health: stress
% points and trauma.

% STRESS POINTS
% Stress points represent fractures in your ego’s in-
% tegrity, cracks in the mental image of yourself. This
% mental damage is experienced as cerebral shocks,
% disorientation, cognitive disconnects, synaptic mis-
% fires, or an undermining of the intellectual faculties.
% On their own, these stress points do not significantly
% impair your character’s functioning, but if allowed to
% accumulate they can have severe repercussions. Ad-
% ditionally, any source that inflicts a large amount of
% stress points at once is likely to have a more severe
% impact (see Trauma).

% Stress points may be reduced by long-term rest, psy-
% chiatric care, and/or psychosurgery (see p. 214).

% LUCIDITY AND STRESS
% Your Lucidity stat benchmarks your character’s mental
% stability. If you build up an amount of stress points
% equal to or greater than your Lucidity score, your char-
% acter’s ego immediately suffers a mental breakdown.
% You effectively go into shock and remain in a catatonic
% state until your stress points are reduced to a level
% below your Lucidity stat. Accumulated stress points
% will overwhelm egos housed inside synthetic shells or
% infomorphs just as they will biological brains—the
% mental software effectively seizes up, incapable of
% functioning until it is debugged.

% INSANITY RATING
% Extreme amounts of built-up stress points can perma-
% nently damage your character’s sanity. If accumulated
% stress points reach your Lucidity x 2, your character’s
% ego undergoes a permanent meltdown. Your mind is
% lost, and no amount of psych help or rest will ever
% bring it back.
% STRESS VALUE
% Any source capable of inflicting cognitive stress is given
% a Stress Value (SV). This indicates the amount of stress
% points the attack or experience inflicts upon a character.
% Like DV, SV is often presented as a variable amount, such
% as 2d10, or sometimes with a modifier, such as 2d10 +
% 10. Simply roll the dice and total the amounts to deter-
% mine the stress points inflicted in that instance. To make
% things easier, a static SV is also given in parentheses after
% the variable amount; use that set amount when you wish
% to keep the game moving and don’t want to roll dice.

% TRAUMA
% Mental trauma is more severe than stress points. Trau-
% mas represent severe mental shocks, a crumbling of
% personality/self, delirium, paradigm shifts, and other
% serious cognitive malfunctions. Traumas impair your
% character’s functioning and may result in temporary
% derangements or permanent disorders.

% If your character receives a number of stress points
% at once that equals or exceeds their Trauma Thresh-
% old, they have suffered a trauma. If the inflicted stress
% points are double or triple the Trauma Threshold, they
% suffer 2 or 3 traumas, respectively, and so on. Trau-
% mas are cumulative and must be recorded on your
% character sheet.

% TRAUMA EFFECTS
% Each trauma applies a cumulative –10 modifier to all
% of the character’s actions. A character with 2 traumas,
% for example, suffers –20 to all actions. These modifiers
% are also cumulative with wound modifiers.

% Disorientation: Any time a character suffers a
% trauma, they must make an immediate WIL x 3 Test.
% Trauma modifiers apply. If they fail, they are tempo-
% rarily stunned and disoriented, and must expend a
% Complex Action to regain their wits.

% Derangements and Disorders: Any time a character
% is hit with a trauma, they suffer a temporary derange-
% ment (see Derangements). The first trauma inflicts a
% minor derangement. If a second trauma is applied,
% the first derangement is either upgraded from minor
% to a moderate derangement, or else a second minor
% derangement is applied (gamemaster’s discretion).
% Likewise, a third trauma may upgrade that derange-
% ment from moderate to major or else inflict a new
% minor. It is generally recommended that derangements
% be upgraded in potency, especially when result from
% the same set of ongoing circumstances. In the case of
% traumas that result from distinctly separate situations
% and sources, separate derangements may be applied.

% Disorder: When four or more traumas have been
% inflicted on a character, a major derangement is up-
% graded to a disorder. Disorders represent long-lasting
% psychological afflictions that typically require weeks
% or even months of psychotherapy and/or psychosur-
% gery to remedy (see Disorders, p. 211).

% %%% txt/212.txt
% DERANGEMENTS
% Derangements are temporary mental conditions that
% result from traumas. Derangements are measured as
% Minor, Moderate, or Major. The gamemaster and
% player should cooperate in choosing which derange-
% ment to apply, as appropriate to the scenario and
% character personality.

% Derangements last for 1d10 ÷ 2 hours (round
% down), or until the character receives psychiatric help,
% whichever comes first. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
% a derangement may last longer if the character has not
% been distanced from the source of the stress, or if they
% remain embroiled in other stress-inducing situations.

% Derangement effects are meant to be role-played.
% The player should incorporate the derangement into
% their character’s words and actions. If the gamemaster
% doesn’t feel the player is stressing the effects enough,
% they can emphasize them. If the gamemaster feels it is
% appropriate, they may also call for additional modi-
% fiers or tests for certain actions.

% ANXIETY (MINOR)
% You suffer a panic attack, exhibiting the physiological
% conditions of fear and worry: sweatiness, racing heart,
% trembling, shortness of breath, headaches, and so on.

% AVOIDANCE (MINOR)
% You are psychologically incapable with dealing with
% the source of the stress, or some circumstance related
% to it, so you avoid it—even covering your ears, curl-
% ing up in a ball, or shutting off your sensors if you
% have to.

% DIZZINESS (MINOR)
% The stress makes you light-headed and disoriented.

% ECHOLALIA (MINOR)
% You involuntarily repeat words and phrases spoken
% by others.

% FIXATION (MINOR)
% You become fixated on something that you did wrong
% or some circumstance that led to your stress. You
% obsess over it, repeating the behavior, trying to fix it,
% running scenarios through your head and out loud,
% and so on.

% HUNGER (MINOR)
% You are suddenly consumed by an irrational yet
% overwhelming desire to eat something—perhaps even
% something unusual.

% INDECISIVENESS (MINOR)
% You are flustered by the cause of your stress, finding it
% difficult to make choices or select courses of action.

% %%% txt/213.txt
% LOGORRHOEA (MINOR)
% Your response to the trauma is to engage in excessive
% talking and babbling. You don’t shut up.

% NAUSEA (MINOR)
% The stress sickens you, forcing you to fight down
% queasiness.

% CHILLS (MODERATE)
% Your body temperature rises, making you feel cold,
% and shivering sets in. You just can’t get warm.

% CONFUSION (MODERATE)
% The trauma scrambles your concentration, making
% you forget what you’re doing, mix up simple tasks,
% and falter over easy decisions.

% ECHOPRAXIA (MODERATE)
% You involuntarily repeat and mimic the actions of
% others around you.

% MOOD SWINGS (MODERATE)
% You lose control of your emotions. You switch from
% ecstasy to tears and back to rage without warning.

% MUTE (MODERATE)
% The trauma shocks you into speechlessness and a com-
% plete inability to effectively communicate.

% NARCISSISM (MODERATE)
% In the wake of the mental shock, all you can think
% about is yourself. You cease caring about those around
% you.

% PANIC (MODERATE)
% You are overwhelmed by fear or anxiety and immedi-
% ately seek to distance yourself from the cause of the
% stress.

% TREMORS (MODERATE)
% You shake violently, making it difficult to hold things
% or stay still.

% BLACKOUT (MAJOR)
% You operate on auto-pilot in a temporary fugue state.
% Later, you will be incapable of recalling what hap-
% pened during this period. (Synthetic shells and info-
% morphs may call up memory records from storage.)

% FRENZY (MAJOR)
% You have a major freak out over the source of the
% stress and attack it.

% HALLUCINATIONS (MAJOR)
% You see, hear, or otherwise sense things that aren’t
% really there.
% HYSTERIA (MAJOR)
% You lose control, panicking over the source of the
% stress. This typically results in an emotional outburst
% of crying, laughing, or irrational fear.

% IRRATIONALITY (MAJOR)
% You are so jarred by the stress that your capacity for
% logical judgment breaks down. You are angered by
% imaginary offenses, hold unreasonable expectations, or
% otherwise accept things with unconvincing evidence.

% PARALYSIS (MAJOR)
% You are so shocked by the trauma that you are effec-
% tively frozen, incapable of making decisions or taking
% action.

% PSYCHOSOMATIC CRIPPLING (MAJOR)
% The trauma overwhelms you, impairing some part of
% your physical functioning. You suffer from an inexpli-
% cable blindness, deafness, or phantom pain, or are sud-
% denly incapable of using a limb or other extremity.

% DISORDERS
% Disorders reflect more permanent madness. In this
% case, “permanent” does not necessarily mean forever,
% but the condition is ongoing until the character has re-
% ceived lengthy and effective psychiatric help. Disorders
% are inflicted whenever a character has accumulated 4
% traumas. The gamemaster and player should choose a
% disorder that fits the situation and character.

% Disorders are not always “active”—they may
% remain dormant until triggered by certain conditions.
% While it is certainly possible to act under a disorder,
% it represents a severe impairment to a person’s ability
% to maintain normal relationships and do a job suc-
% cessfully. Disorders should not be glamorized as cute
% role-playing quirks. They represent the best attempts
% of a damaged psyche to deal with a world that has
% failed it in some way. Additionally, people in many
% habitats, particularly those in the inner system, still
% regard disorders as a mark of social stigma and may
% react negatively towards impaired characters.

% Characters that acquire disorders over the course
% of their adventures may get rid of them in one of two
% ways, either through in-game attempts to treat them
% (p. 214) or by buying them off as they would a nega-
% tive trait (p. 153).

% ADDICTION
% Addiction as a disorder can refer to any sort of addic-
% tive behavior focused toward a particular behavior or
% substance, to the point where the user is unable to func-
% tion without the addiction but is also severely impaired
% due to the effects of the addiction. It is marked by a
% desire on the part of the subject to seek help or reduce
% the use of the addicting substance/act, but also by the
% subject spending large amounts of time in pursuit of

% %%% txt/214.txt
% their addiction to the exclusion of other activities. This
% is a step up from Addiction negative trait listed on p.
% 148—this is much more of a crippling behavior that
% compensates for spending time away from the addic-
% tion. Addictions are typically related to the trauma
% that caused the disorder (VR or drug addictions are
% encouraged).

% Suggested Game Effects: The addict functions in
% only two states: under the influence of their addic-
% tion or in withdrawal. Additionally, they spend large
% amounts of time away from their other responsibili-
% ties in pursuit of their addiction.

% ATAVISM
% Atavism is a disorder that mainly affects uplifts. It
% results in them regressing to an earlier un- or partial-
% ly-uplifted state. They may exhibit behaviors more
% closely in line with their more animalistic forbears, or
% they may lose some of their uplift benefits such as the
% ability for abstract reasoning or speech.

% Suggested Game Effects: The player and gamemas-
% ter should discuss how much of the uplift’s nature is
% lost and adjust game penalties accordingly. It is im-
% portant to note that other uplifts view atavistic uplifts
% with something akin to horror and will usually have
% nothing to do with them.

% ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)
% This disorder manifests as a marked inability to focus
% on any one task for an extended period of time, and
% also an inability to notice details in most situations.
% Sufferers may find themselves starting multiple tasks,
% beginning a new one after only a cursory attempt at
% the prior task. ADHD suffers may also have a manic
% edge that manifests as confidence in their ability to get
% a given job done, even though they will quickly lose
% all interest in it.

% Suggested Game Effects: Perception and related
% skill penalties. Increased difficulty modifiers to task
% actions, particularly as the action drags on.

% AUTOPHAGY
% This is a disorder that usually only occurs among up-
% lifted octopi. It is a form of anxiety disorder character-
% ized by self-cannibalism of the limbs. Subjects afflicted
% with autophagy will, under stress, begin to consume
% their limbs, if at all possible, causing themselves po-
% tentially serious harm.

% Suggested Game Effects: Anytime an uplifted octopi
% with this disorder is placed in a stressful situation they
% must make a successful WIL x 3 Test or begin to con-
% sume one of their limbs.

% BIPOLAR DISORDER
% Bipolar disorder is also called manic depression. It is
% similar to depression except for the fact that the peri-
% ods of depression are interrupted by brief (a matter of
% days at most) periods of mania where the subject feels
% inexplicably “up” about everything with heightened
% energy and a general disregard for consequences. The
% depressive stages are similar in all ways to depression.
% The manic stages are dangerous since the subject
% will take risks, spend wildly, and generally engage in
% behavior without much in the way of forethought or
% potential long term consequences.

% Suggested Game Effects: Similar to depression, but
% when manic the character must make a WIL x 3 Test
% to not do some action that may be potentially risky.
% They will also try to convince others to go along with
% the idea.

% BODY DYSMORPHIA
% Subjects afflicted with this disorder believe that they
% are so unspeakably hideous that they are unable to
% interact with others or function normally for fear of
% ridicule and humiliation at their appearance. They
% tend to be very secretive and reluctant to seek help
% because they are afraid others will think them vain—
% or they may feel too embarrassed to do so. Ironi-
% cally, BDD is often misunderstood as a vanity-driven
% obsession, whereas it is quite the opposite; people
% with BDD believe themselves to be irrevocably ugly
% or defective. A similar disorder, gender identity dis-
% order, where the patient is upset with their entire
% sexual biology, often precipitates BDD-like feelings.
% Gender identity disorder is directed specifically at
% external sexually dimorphic features, which are in
% constant conflict with the patient’s internal psychi-
% atric gender.

% Suggested Game Effects: Because of the nature of
% Eclipse Phase and the ability to swap out and modify
% a body, this is a fairly common disorder. It is suggested
% that players with this suffer increased or prolonged
% resleeving penalties since they are unable to fully
% adjust to the reality of their new morph.

% BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
% This disorder is marked by a general inability to fully
% experience one’s self any longer. Emotional states are
% variable and often marked by extremes and acting
% out. Simply put, the subject feels like they are losing
% their sense of self and seeks constant reassurance
% from others around them, yet is not fully able to act
% in an appropriate way. They may also engage in im-
% pulsive behaviors in an attempt to experience some
% sort of feeling. In extreme cases, there may be suicidal
% thoughts or attempts.

% Suggested Game Effects: The character needs to
% be around others and will not be left alone, however
% they also are not quite able to relate to others in a
% normal way and may also take risks or make impul-
% sive decisions.

% DEPRESSION
% Clinical depression is characterized by intense feelings
% of hopelessness and worthlessness. Subjects usually
% report feeling as though nothing they do matters and
% no one would care anyway, so they are disinclined to

% %%% txt/215.txt
% attempt much in the way of anything. The character is
% depressed and finds it difficult to be motivated to do
% much of anything. Even simple acts such as eating and
% bathing can seem to be monumental tasks.

% Suggested Game Effect: Depressives often lack the
% will to take any sort of action, often to the point of re-
% quiring a WIL x 3 Test to engage in sustained activity.

% FUGUE
% The character enters into a fugue state where they
% display little attention to external stimuli. They will
% still function physiologically but refrain from speak-
% ing and stare off into the distance, unable to focus on
% events around them. Unlike catatonia, a person in a
% fugue state will walk around if lead about by a helper,
% but is otherwise unresponsive. The fugue state is usu-
% ally a persistent state, but it can be an occasional state
% that is triggered by some sort of external stimuli simi-
% lar to the original trauma that triggered the disorder.

% Suggested Game Effects: Characters in a fugue state
% are totally non-responsive to most stimuli around
% them. They will not even defend themselves if at-
% tacked and will usually attempt to curl into a fetal
% position if physically assaulted.

% GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD)
% GAD results in severe feelings of anxiety about nearly
% everything the character comes into contact with.
% Even simple tasks represent the potential for failure
% on a catastrophic scale and should be avoided or mini-
% mized. Additionally, negative outcomes for any action
% are always assumed to be the only possible outcomes.

% Suggested Game Effects: A character with GAD will
% be almost entirely useless unless convinced otherwise,
% and then only for a short period of time. Another
% character can attempt to use a relevant social skill to
% coax the GAD character into doing what is required
% of them. If the character with the disorder fails at the
% task, however, all future attempts to coax them will
% suffer a cumulative –10 penalty.

% HYPOCHONDRIA
% Hypochondriacs suffer from a delusion that they are
% sick in ways that they are not. They will create dis-
% orders that they believe they suffer from, usually to
% get the attention of others. Often hypochondriacs will
% inflict harm on themselves or even ingest substances
% that will aid in producing symptoms similar to the
% disorder they believe they have. These attempts to
% simulate symptoms can and will cause actual harm to
% hypochondriacs.

% Possible Game Effects: A subject that is hypochon-
% driac will often behave as though they are under the
% effects of some other disorder or physical malady.
% This can be consistent over time or can be different
% and ever changing. They will react with hostility to
% claims that they are faking or not actually ill.
% IMPULSE CONTROL DISORDER
% Subjects have a certain act or belief that they must
% engage in a certain activity that comes into their
% mind. This can be kleptomania, pyromania, sexual
% exhibitionism, etc. They feel a sense of building
% anxiety whenever they are prevented from engaging
% in this behavior for an extended period (usually sev-
% eral times a day to weekly, depending on the impulse)
% and will often attempt to engage in this behavior at
% inconvenient or inappropriate times. This is differ-
% ent from OCD in the sense that OCD is usually a
% single contained behavior that must be engaged in to
% reduce anxiety. Impulse control disorder is a variety
% of behaviors and can be virtually any sort of highly
% inappropriate action.

% Suggested Game Effects: Similar to OCD, if the
% player doesn’t engage in the behavior they will grow
% increasingly disturbed and suffer penalties to all ac-
% tions until they are able to engage in the compulsion
% that alleviates their anxiety.

% INSOMNIA
% Insomniacs find themselves unable to sleep, or unable
% to sleep for an extended period of time. This is most
% often due to anxiety about their lives or as a result
% of depression and the accompanying negative thought
% patterns. This is not the sort of sleeplessness that is
% brought about as a result of normal stress but rather
% a near total inability to find rest in sleep when it is
% desired. Insomniacs may find themselves nodding off
% at inopportune times, but never for long, and never
% enough to gain any restful sleep. As a result, they
% are frequently lethargic and inattentive as their lack
% of sleep robs them of their edge and eventually any
% semblance of alertness. Additionally, insomniacs are
% frequently irritable due to being on edge and unable
% to rest.

% Suggested Game Effects: Due to the lack of mean-
% ingful sleep, insomniacs should suffer from blanket
% penalties to perception related tasks or anything re-
% quiring concentration or prolonged fine motor abilities.

% MEGALOMANIA
% A megalomaniac believes themselves to be the single
% most important person in the universe. Nothing is
% more important than the megalomaniac and every-
% thing around them must be done according to their
% whim. Failure to comply with the dictates of a mega-
% lomaniac can often result in rages or actual physical
% assaults by the subject.

% Suggested Game Effects: A character that has
% megalomania will demand attention and has diffi-
% culty in nearly any social situation. Additionally, they
% may be provoked to violence if they think they are
% being slighted.

% %%% txt/216.txt
% MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER
% This is the development of a separate, distinct per-
% sonality from the original or control personality.
% The personalities may or may not be aware of each
% other and “conscious” during the actions of the other
% personality. Usually there is some sort of trigger that
% results in the emergence of the non-control personality.
% Most subjects have only a single extra personality, but
% it is not unheard of to have several personalities. It
% is important to note that these are distinct individual
% personalities and not just crude caricatures of the Dr.
% Jekyll/Mr. Hyde sort. Each personality sees itself as
% a distinct person with their own wants, needs, and
% motivations. Additionally, they are usually unaware
% of the experiences of the others, though there is some
% basic information sharing (such as language and core
% skill sets).

% Suggested Game Effects: When the player is under
% the effects of another personality, they should be
% treated as an NPC. In some rare cases the player and
% the gamemaster can work out the second personality
% and allow the player to roleplay this. This does not
% however constitute an entire new character that can
% be “turned on” at will.

% OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
% Subjects with OCD are marked by intrusive or in-
% appropriate thoughts or impulses that cause acute
% anxiety if a particular obsession or compulsion is not
% engaged in to alleviate them. These obsessions and
% compulsions can be nearly any sort of behavior that
% must be immediately engaged in to keep the rising
% anxiety at bay. Players and gamemasters are encour-
% aged to come up with a behavior that is suitable.
% Examples of common behaviors include repetitive
% tics (touching every finger of each hand to another
% part of the body, tapping the right foot twenty times),
% pathological behaviors such as gambling or eating,
% or a mental ritual that must be completed (reciting a
% book passage).

% Suggested Game Effects: If the player doesn’t
% engage in the behavior they will grow increasingly
% disturbed and suffer penalties to all actions until they
% are able to engage in the compulsion that alleviates
% their anxiety.

% POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
% PTSD occurs as a result of being exposed to either
% a single incident or a series of incidents where the
% sufferer had their own life, or saw the lives of others,
% threatened with death. These incidents are often
% marked by an inability on the part of the victim, either
% real or perceived, to do anything to alter the outcomes.
% As a result, they develop an acute anxiety and fixation
% on these incidents to the point where they lose sleep,
% become irritated or easily angered, or are depressed
% over feelings that they lack control in their own lives.

% Suggested Game Effects: Penalties to task actions,
% also treat situations similar to the initial episodes that
% caused the disorder as a phobia.
% SCHIZOPHRENIA
% While schizophrenia is generally acknowledged as a
% genetic disorder that has an onset in early adulthood,
% it also seems to develop in a number of egos that un-
% dergo frequent morph changes. It has been theorized
% that this is due to some sort of repetitive error in the
% download process. Regardless, it remains a rare, yet
% persistent danger of dying and being brought back.
% Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder where the sub-
% ject loses their ability to discern reality from unreality.
% This can involve delusions, hallucinations (often in
% support of the delusions), and fragmented or disor-
% ganized speech. The subject will not be aware of these
% behaviors and will perceive themselves as functioning
% normally, often to the point of becoming paranoid that
% others are somehow involved in a grand deception.

% Suggested Game Effects: Schizophrenia represents
% a total break from reality. A character that is schizo-
% phrenic may see and hear things and act on those
% delusions and hallucinations while seeing attempts
% by their friends to stop or explain to them as part of
% a wider conspiracy. Adding to this is the difficulty of
% communicating coherently. Players that have become
% schizophrenic are only marginally functional and
% only for short periods of time until they have the
% disorder treated.

% STRESSFUL SITUATIONS
% The universe of Eclipse Phase is ripe with experiences
% that might rattle a character’s sanity. Some of these are

% WILLPOWER STRESS TESTS
% Whenever a character encounters a situation that
% might impact their ego’s psyche, the gamemaster may
% call for a (Willpower x 3) Test. This test determines if
% the character is able to cope with the unnerving situa-
% tion or if the experience scars their mental landscape.
% If they succeed, the character is shaken but otherwise
% unaffected. If they fail, they suffer stress damage (and
% possibly trauma) as appropriate to the situation. A
% list of stress-inducing scenarios and suggested SVs are
% listed on the Stressful Experiences table, p. 215. The
% gamemaster should use these as a guideline, modifying
% them as appropriate to the situation at hand.

% Note that some incidents may be so horrific that a
% modifier is applied to the character’s (Willpower x 3)
% Test.

% HARDENING
% The more you are exposed to horrible or terrifying
% things, the less scary they become. After repeated ex-
% posure, you become hardened to such things, able to
% shake them off without effect.

%  Every time you succeed in a Willpower Test to avoid
%  taking stress from a particular source, take note. If you
%  successfully resist such a situation 5 times, you become
%  effectively immune to taking stress from that source.

%  The drawback to hardening yourself to such situa-
%  tions is that you grow detached and callous. In order
%  to protect yourself, you have learned to cut off your
%  emotions—but it is such emotions that make you
%  human. You have erected mental walls that will affect
%  your empathy and ability to relate to others.

%  Each time you harden yourself to one source of
%  stress, your maximum Moxie stat is reduced by 1.
%  Psychotherapy may be used to overcome such harden-
%  ing, in the same way a disorder is treated.

%  MENTAL HEALING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
%  Stress is trickier to heal than physical damage. There
%  are no nano-treatments or quick fix options (other
%  than killing yourself and reverting to a non-stressed
%  backup). The options for recuperating are simply natu-
%  ral healing over time, psychotherapy, or psychosurgery.


%            PSYCHOTHERAPY CARE


%            Characters with an appropriate skill—


%            Medicine: Psychiatry, Academics: Psychol-
% und down)        ogy, or Professional: Psychotherapy—can


%             assist a character suffering mental stress
% und down)


%             or trauma with psychotherapy. This treat-
% und down)


%             ment is a long-term process, involving
% und down)        methods such as psychoanalysis, counsel-
% und down)        ing, roleplaying, relationship-building,
% 0                hypnotherapy, behavioral modification,
% 0                drugs, medical treatments, and even psy-
% 0                chosurgery (p. 229). AIs skilled in psycho-
% und down)        therapy are also available.


%                Psychotherapy is a task action, with a
% +2


%             timeframe of 1 hour per point of stress,
% +5              8 hours per trauma, and 40 hours per
% 0                disorder. Note that this only counts the
% +2               time actually spent in psychotherapy with
% +3               a skilled professional. After each psycho-
% +5               therapy session, make a test to see if the
% und down)        session was successful. Successful psycho-


%             surgery adds a +30 modifier to this test; at

%             the gamemaster’s discretion, other modi-
% +3


%             fiers may apply. Likewise, each disorder

% und down)       Traumas may not be healed until all stress
% 0                is eliminated.
% +3                  When a trauma is healed, the derange-
%  p. 366          ment associated with that trauma is
% +2               eliminated or downgraded. Disorders are


%             treated separately from the trauma that


%             caused them, and may only be treated


%            when all other traumas are removed.


%  Gamemaster and players are encouraged to roleplay

%  a character’s suffering and relief from traumas and

%  disorders. Each is an experience that makes a profound

%  impact on a character’s personality and psyche. The

%  process of treatment may also change them, so in the

%  end they may be a transformed from the person they

%  once were. Even if treated, the scars are likely to remain

%  for some time to come. According to some opinions,

%  disorders are never truly eradicated, they are just eased

%  into submission ... where they may linger beneath the

%  surface, waiting for some trauma to come along.


% NATURAL HEALING

% Characters who eschew psychotherapy can hopefully

% work out the problems in their head on their own over

% time. For every month that passes without accruing

% new stress, the character may make a WIL x 3 Test. If

% successful, they heal 1d10 points of stress or 1 trauma

% (all stress must be healed first). Disorders are even more

% difficult to heal, requiring 3 months without stress or

% trauma, and even then only being eliminated with a

% successful WIL Test. As a result, disorders can linger

% for years until resolved with actual psychotherapy.

%  HACKS

% Though neuroscience has ascended to impressive

% pinnacles, allowing minds to be thoroughly scanned,

% mapped, and emulated as software, the transhuman

% brain remains a place that is complicated, not fully

% understood, and thoroughly messy. Despite a preva-

% lence of neural modifications, meddling with the seat

% of consciousness remains a tricky and hazardous

% procedure. Nevertheless, psychosurgery—editing the

% mind as software—remains common and widespread,

% sometimes with unexpected results.


% Likewise, even as the knowledge of neuroscientists

% grows on an exponential basis, some are discovering

% that minds are far more mysterious than they had ever

% imagined. During the Fall, scattered reports of “anom-

% alous activity” by individuals infected by one of the

% numerous circulating nanoplagues were discounted

% as fear and paranoia, but subsequent investigations

% by black budget labs has proven otherwise. Now, top-

% level confidential networks whisper that this infection

% inflicts intricate changes in the victim’s neural network

% that imbue them with strange and inexplicable abili-

% ties. The exact mechanism and nature of these abilities

% remains unexplained and outside the grasp of modern

% transhuman science. Given the evidence of a new

% brainwave type and the paranormal nature of this

% phenomenon, it is loosely referred to as “psi.”




% PSI

% In Eclipse Phase, psi is considered a special cognitive

% condition resulting from infection by the mutant—and

% hopefully otherwise benign—Watts-Macleod strain

% of the Exsurgent virus (p. 367). This plague modifies

% the victim’s mind, conferring special abilities. These

% abilities are inherent to the brain’s architecture and

% are copied when the mind is uploaded, allowing the

% character to retain their psi abilities when changing

% from morph to morph.


% PREREQUISITES

% To wield psi, a character must acquire the Psi trait (p.

% 147) during character creation. It is theoretically also

% possible to acquire the use of psi in game via infec-

% tion by the Watts-MacLeod strain; see The Exsurgent

% Virus, p. 362.


% Psi ability is considered an innate ability of the

% ego and not a biological or genetic predisposition of

% the morph. While psi researchers do not understand

% how it is possible to transfer this ability via uploads,

% backups, and farcasting, it has been speculated that

% all components of an async’s ego are entangled on a

% quantum level, or that they possess the ability to en-

% tangle themselves or form a unique conformation or

% alignment as a whole even after they have been copied,

% up-, or downloaded. This speculated entanglement

%  process is also thought to be the origin of the impair-
%  ment that asyncs experience when adapting to a new
%  morph (see below).

%  MORPHS AND PSI
%  Asyncs require a biological brain to draw on their
%  abilities (the brains of uplifted animals count). An
%  async whose ego is downloaded into an infomorph or
%  fully computerized brain (synthmorphs) has no access
%  to their abilities as long they remain in that morph.

% Asyncs inhabiting a pod morph may use psi, but
%  their abilities are restricted as pod brains are only
%  partly biological. Pod-morphed asyncs suffer a –30
%  modifier on all tests involving the use of psi sleights
%  and the impact from using sleights would be doubled.

%  MORPH ACCLIMATIZATION
%  Async minds undergo extra difficulty adjusting to new
%  morphs. For 1 day after the character has resleeved,
%  they will suffer the effects of a single derangement
%  (p. 210). The gamemaster and player should choose a
%  derangement appropriate to the character and story.
%  Minor derangements are recommended, but at the
%  gamemaster’s discretion moderate or major derange-
%  ments may be applied. No trauma is inflicted with
%  this derangement.

%  MORPH FEVER
%  Asyncs find it irritating and traumatizing to endure life
%  as an infomorph, pod, or synthmorph for long periods
%  of time. This phenomenon, known as morph fever,
%  might cause temporary derangements and trauma to
%  the asyncs’ ego, possibly even to the grade of perma-
%  nent disorders. If stored or held captive as an active
%  infomorph (i.e. not in virtual stasis), the async might
%  go insane if not psychologically aided by some sort of
%  anodyne program or supporting person during storage.

% In game terms, asyncs take 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up)
%  points of mental stress damage per month they stay
%  in a pod, synthmorph or infomorph form without
%  psychological assistance by a psychiatrist, software,
%  or muse.

%  PSI DRAWBACKS
%  There are several drawbacks to psi ability:

% • The variant Exsurgent strain that endows psi ability

% rewires the character’s brain. An unfortunate side

% effect to this change is that asyncs acquire a vulner-

% ability to mental stress. Reduce the async’s Trauma

% Threshold by 1.
% • The mental instability that accompanies psi infec-

% tion also tends to unhinge the character’s mind.

% Asyncs acquires one Mental Disorder negative trait

% (p. 150) for each level they have of the Psi trait

% %%% txt/223.txt

% without receiving any bonus CP. The gamemaster

% and player should agree on a disorder appropriate

% to the character. This disorder may be treated over

% time, according to normal rules (see Mental Healing

% and Psychotherapy, p. 215).
% • Characters with the Psi trait are also vulnerable to

% infection by other strains of the Exsurgent virus.

% The character suffers a –20 modifier when resisting

% Exsurgent infection (p. 362).
% • Critical failures when using psi tend to stress the

% async’s mind. Each time a critical failure is rolled

% when making a sleight-related test, the async suffers

% a temporary brain seizure. They suffer a –30 modi-

% fier and are incapable of acting until the end of the

% next Action Turn. They must also succeed in a WIL

% + COG Test or fall down.

% PSI SKILLS AND SLEIGHTS
% Transhuman psi users can manipulate their egos and
% otherwise create effects that can often be neither
% matched nor mimicked by technological means. To use
% these abilities, they train their mental processes and
% practice cognitive algorithms called sleights, which
% they can subconsciously recall and use as necessary.
% Sleights fall into two categories: psi-chi (cognitive
% enhancements, p. 223) and psi-gamma (brainwave
% reading and manipulation, p. 225). Psi-chi sleights are
% available to anyone with the Psi trait (p. 147), but psi-
% gamma sleights are only available to characters with
% the Psi trait at Level 2. In order to use these sleights,
% the async must be skilled in the Control (p. 178), Psi
% Assault (p. 183), and/or Sense skills (p. 184), as ap-
% propriate to each sleight.

% ROLEPLAYING ASYNCS
% Any player who chooses to play an async should keep
% the origin of their abilities in mind: Watts-MacLeod
% strain infection. The character may not be aware of
% this source, but they undoubtedly know that they un-
% derwent some sort of transformation and have talents
% that no one else does. If unaware of the infection, they
% have likely learned to keep their abilities secret lest
% they be ridiculed, attacked, or whisked away to some
% secret testing program. Learning the truth about their
% nature could even be the starting point of a campaign
% and/or their introduction to Firewall. If they know the
% truth, however, the character must live with the fact
% that they are the victim of a nanoplague likely spread
% by the TITANs that may or may not lead to complica-
% tions, side effects, or other unexpected revelations in
% their future.

% Gamemasters and players should make an effort
% to explore the nature of this infection and how the
% character perceives it. As noted previously, asyncs are
% often profoundly-changed people. The invasive and
% alien aspect of their abilities should not be lost on
% them. For example, an async might conceive of their
% psi talents as a sort of parasitic entity, living off their
% sleights, or they might feel that using these powers
% puts them in touch with some sort of fundamental
% substrate of the universe that is weird and terrifying.
% Alternately, they could feel as if their personality was
% melded with something different, something that
% doesn’t belong. Each async is likely to view their situ-
% ation differently, and none of them pleasantly.

% USING PSI
% Using psi—i.e., drawing on a certain sleight to pro-
% cure some kind of effect—does not always require a
% test. Each sleight description details how the power
% is used.

% ACTIVE PSI
% Active psi sleights must be “activated” to be used.
% These sleights usually require a skill test. Sleights that
% target other sentient beings or life forms are always
% Opposed Tests, while others are handled as Success
% Tests. The level of concentration required to use these
% sleights varies, and so may call for a Quick, Complex,
% or Task Action. Active sleights also cause strain (p.
% 223) to the async. Most psi-gamma sleights fall into
% this category.

% PASSIVE PSI
% Passive psi sleights encompasses abilities that are con-
% sidered automatically active and subconscious. They
% rarely require an action to be activated and require
% no effort or strain by the psi user. Passive sleights typi-
% cally add bonuses to various activities or allow access
% to certain abilities rather than calling for some kind of
% skill test. Most psi-chi sleights fall into this category.

% PSI RANGE
% Sleights have a Range of either Self, Touch, or Close.

% Self: These sleights only affect the async.

% Touch: Sleights with a Touch range may be used
% against other biological life, but the async must have
% physical contact with the target. If the target avoids
% being touched, this requires a successful melee attack,
% applying the touch-only +20 modifier. This attack
% does not cause damage, and is considered part of the
% same action as the psi use.

% Close: Close sleights involve interaction with other
% biological life from a short distance. The optimal dis-
% tance is within 5 meters. For each meter beyond that,
% apply a –10 modifier to the test.

% Psi vs. Psi: Due to the nature of psi, sleights are
% more effective against other psi users. Sleights with
% a range of Touch may be used from a Close range
% against another async. Likewise, a sleight with a Close
% range may be used at twice the normal distance (10
% meters) when wielded on another async.

% TARGETING
% Synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles may not be targeted
% by psi sleights, as they lack biological brains. Pods—
% with brains that are half biological and half com-
% puter—are less susceptible and receive a +30 modifier

% %%% txt/224.txt
% when defending against psi use. Note that infomorphs
% may never be targeted by psi sleights as psi is not ef-
% fective within the mesh or simulspace.

% Multiple Targets: An async may target more than
% one character with a sleight with the same action, as
% long as each of them can be targeted via the rules
% above. The psi character only rolls once, with each of
% the defending characters making their Opposed Tests
% against that roll. The psi character suffers strain (p.
% 223) for each target, however, meaning that using psi
% on multiple targets can be extremely dangerous.

% Animals and Less Complex Life Forms: Psi works
% against any living creature with a brain and/or
% nervous system. Against partially-sentient and par-
% tially-uplifted animals, it suffers a –20 modifier and
% increases strain by +1. Against non-sentient animals,
% it suffers a –30 modifier and increases strain by +3. It
% has no effect on or against less complex life forms like
% plants, algae, bacteria, etc.

% Factors and Aliens: At the gamemaster’s discretion,
% psi sleights may not work on alien creatures at all, de-
% pending on their physiology and neurology. If it does
% work, it is likely to suffer at least a –20 modifier and
% +1 strain.

% OPPOSED TESTS
% Psi that is used against another character is resisted
% with an Opposed Test. Defending characters resist with
% WIL x 2. Willing characters may choose not to resist.
% Unconscious or sleeping characters cannot resist.

% If the psi-wielding character succeeds and the de-
% fender fails, the sleight affects the target. If the psi user
% fails, the defender is unscathed. If both parties suc-
% ceed in their tests, compare their dice rolls. If the psi
% user’s roll is higher, the sleight bypasses the defender’s
% mental block and affects the target; otherwise, the
% sleight fails to affect the defender’s ego.

% TARGET AWARENESS
% The target of a psi sleight is aware they are being
% targeted any time they succeed on their half of the
% Opposed Test (regardless on whether the async
% rolls higher or not). Note that awareness does not
% necessarily mean that the target understands that psi
% abilities are being used on them, especially as most
% people in Eclipse Phase are unaware of psi’s existence.
% Instead, the target is simply likely to understand that
% some outside influence is at work, or that something
% strange is happening. They may suspect that they
% have been drugged or are under the influence of some
% strange technology.

% Targets who fail their roll remain unaware.

% PSI FULL DEFENSE
% Like full defense in physical combat (p. 198), a de-
% fender may spend a Complex Action to rally and con-
% centrate their mental defenses, gaining a +30 modifier
% to their defense test against psi use until their next
% Action Phase.

% %%% txt/225.txt
% CRITICALS
% If the defender rolls a critical success, the character
% attempting to wield psi is temporarily locked out of
% the target’s mind. The psi user may not target that
% character with sleights until an appropriate “reset”
% period has passed, determined by the gamemaster.

% If the async rolls a critical failure, they suffer tempo-
% rary incapacitation as their mind dysfunctions in some
% harsh and distressing ways (see Psi Drawbacks, p. 221).

% If a psi user rolls a critical success against a de-
% fender, or the defender rolls a critical failure, double
% the potency of the sleight’s effect. In the case of psi at-
% tacks, the DV can be doubled or mental armor can be
% bypassed. Alternately, when using Psi Assault (p. 183),
% the targeted character may be in danger of infection
% by the Watts-Macleod strain (p. 362).

% MENTAL ARMOR
% The Psi Shield sleight (p. 228) provides mental armor,
% a form of neural hardening against psi-based attacks.
% Like physical armor, this mental armor reduces the
% amount of damage inflicted by a psi assault.

% DURATION
% Psi sleights have one of four durations: constant, in-
% stant, temporary, or sustained.

% Constant: Constant sleights are always “on.”

% Instant: Instant sleights take effect only in the
% Action Phase in which they are used.

% Temporary: Temporary sleights last for a limited
% duration with no extra effort from the async. The
% temporary duration is determined by the async’s WIL
% ÷ 5 (round up) and is measured in either Action Turns
% or minutes, as noted. Strain for the sleight is applied
% immediately when used, not at the end of the duration.

% Sustained: Sustained sleights require active effort
% to maintain for as long as the async wants to keep
% it active. Sustaining a sleight requires concentration,
% and so the async suffers a –10 modifier to all other
% skill tests while the sleight is sustained. The async
% must also stay within the range appropriate to the
% sleight, otherwise the sleight immediately ends. More
% than one sleight may be sustained at a time, with a
% cumulative modifier. Strain for the sleight is applied
% immediately when used, not at the end of the dura-
% tion. At the gamemaster’s discretion, sleights that are
% sustained for long periods may incur additional strain.

% STRAIN
% The use of psi is physically (and sometimes psycho-
% logically) draining to a psi user. This phenomenon is
% known as strain, and manifests as fatigue, exhaustion,
% pain, neural overload, cardiovascular stress, and
% adynamia (loss of vigor). Though strain has only
% rarely been known to actually kill an async, the use
% of too much active psi can be life-threatening in some
% circumstances.

% In game terms, every active sleight has a Strain
% Value of 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) DV. Every active sleight
% lists a Strain Value Modifier that modifies this amount.
% For example, a sleights with a Strain Value Modifier
% of –1 inflicts (1d10 ÷ 2) –1 DV.

% If the damage points suffered from strain exceed
% the character’s Wound Threshold, they may inflict a
% wound just like other damage (see Wounds, p. 207).




%       Matric is investigating a disappearance, so he


%       decides to use his Qualia sleight to boost his


%       Intuition while hunting for clues. That psi-chi


%       sleight takes only a Quick Action to initiate and


%       requires no test. Matric’s WIL is 25, so the dura-


%       tion of this temporary sleight is 5 Action Turns (25


%       ÷ 5 = 5). The sleight’s Strain modifier is –1, so


%       he is facing (1d10 ÷ 2) –1 DV. He rolls a 1, so he


%       takes no strain at all!


%          Later on, Matric finds himself in a life-or-death


%       struggle with a kidnapper. Lucky for Matric,


%       they’re in a melee, so he’s close enough to try
%  EXAMPLE






%       and touch his opponent. On his Action Phase, he


%       makes an Unarmed Combat Test with a +20 mod-


%       ifier (for a touch-only attack) and succeeds. This


%       allows him to try and use his Psychic Stab sleight.


%       He rolls his Psi Assault of 57 against the target’s


%       WIL x 2 (32). His target is in a worker pod morph,


%       however, which is less susceptible to psi, so he


%       receives a +30 modifier (32 + 30 = 62). Matric


%       rolls a 32 and the worker pod a 64—Matric wins!


%       For damage, he rolls 1d10 + (WIL ÷ 10). His WIL


%       is 25, so that’s 1d10 + 3. He rolls a score a 7 and


%       inflicts 10 (7 + 3) points of damage. The worker


%       pod screams in pain, suffering a wound from the


%       psychic assault.


% PSI-CHI SLEIGHTS
% Psi-chi sleights are async abilities that speed up cogni-
% tive informatics (internal information processing) and
% enhance the user’s perception and cognition.

% AMBIENCE SENSE


%   PSI TYPE:    Passive        ACTION:    Automatic

% RANGE:      Self        DURATION: Constant
% This sleight provides the async with an instinctive
% sense about an area and any potential threats nearby.
% The async receives a +10 modifier to all Investigation,
% Perception, Scrounging, and Surprise Tests.

% COGNITIVE BOOST


%   PSI TYPE:    Active         ACTION:    Quick


%   RANGE:       Self           DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)


%  STRAIN MOD: –1
% The async can temporarily elevate their cognitive
% performance. In game terms, Cognition is raised by 5
% for the chosen duration. This boost to Cognition also
% raises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.

% %%% txt/226.txt
% DOWNTIME

% PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Task (min. 4 hours)

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION:   Sustained

% STRAIN MOD: 0
% This sleight provides the async with the ability
% to send the mind into a fugue-state regenerative
% downtime, during which the character’s psyche is
% repaired. The async must enter the downtime for
% at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals
% 1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements,
% and disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For
% all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during
% downtime, completely oblivious to the outside
% world. Only severe disturbances or physical shock
% (such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon)
% will bring the async out of it.

% EMOTION CONTROL

% PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Constant
% Emotion Control gives the async tight control
% over their emotional states. Unwanted emotions
% can be blocked out and others embraced. This has
% the benefit of protecting the async from emotional
% manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight or
% Intimidation skill tests. The async receives a +30
% modifier when defending against such tests.

% ENHANCED CREATIVITY

% PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic

% RANGE:     Self         DURATION: Constant
% An async with Enhanced Creativity is more imagi-
% native and more inclined to think outside the box.
% Apply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativ-
% ity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity can
% sometimes seem strange and different, manifesting
% in odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork.

% FILTER

% PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic

% RANGE:       Self         DURATION: Constant
% Filter allows the async to filter out out distractions
% and eliminate negative situational modifiers from
% distraction, up to the gamemaster’s discretion.

% GROK

% PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION:   Instant

% STRAIN MOD: –1
% By using the Grok sleight, the async is able to
% intuitively understand how any unfamiliar object,
% vehicle, or device is used simply by looking at and
% handling it. If the character succeeds in a COG x 2
% Test, they achieve a basic ability to use the object,
% vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre.
% This sleight does not provide any understanding of
% the principles or technologies involved—the psi user
% simply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called
% for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the
% device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices,
% and/or tests the character is defaulting on—it does not
% apply to devices the character is familiar with).

% HIGH PAIN THRESHOLD

% PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic

% RANGE:       Self        DURATION: Constant
% This sleight allows the async to block out, ignore, or
% otherwise isolate pain. The async reduces negative
% modifiers from wounds by 10.

% HYPERTHYMESIA

% PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic

%  RANGE:      Self         DURATION: Constant
% Hyperthymesia grants the async a superior auto-
% biographical memory, allowing them to remember the
% most trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be
% asked a random date and recall the day of the week
% it was, the events that occurred that day, what the
% weather was like, and many seemingly trivial details
% that most people would not be able to recall.

% INSTINCT

% PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic

%  RANGE:      Self        DURATION: Constant
% Instinct bolsters the async’s subconscious ability to
% gauge a situation and make a snap judgment that
% is just as accurate as a careful, considered decision.
% For Task Actions that involve analysis or planning
% alone (typically Mental skill actions), the async may
% reduce the timeframe by 90% without suffering a
% modifier. For Task Actions that involve partial analy-
% sis/planning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30%
% without penalty.

% MULTITASKING

% PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic

% RANGE:     Self         DURATION: Constant
% The async can handle vast amounts of information
% without overload and can perform more than one
% mental task at once. The character receives an extra
% Complex Action each Action Phase that may only be
% used for mental or mesh actions.

% PATTERN RECOGNITION

% PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic

%  RANGE:     Self         DURATION: Constant
% The character is adept at spotting patterns and corre-
% lating the non-random elements of a jumble—related
% items jump out at them. This is useful for translating
% languages, breaking codes, or find clues hidden among
% massive amounts of data. The character must have

% %%% txt/227.txt
% a sufficiently large sample enough time to study, as
% determined by the gamemaster. This might range from
% a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman lan-
% guage to a few days of investigating inscriptions left
% by long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching
% a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by
% reading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a
% +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investiga-
% tion, Research, or cod-breaking Tests (note that this
% does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to
% decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to
% more easily learn new languages, reducing the training
% time by half.

% PREDICTIVE BOOST

% PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:    Automatic

%  RANGE:     Self        DURATION: Constant
% The Bayesian probability machine features of the
% async’s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing
% their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of
% events around them as they unfold in real-time and
% update those predictions as information changes.
% In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense
% for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the
% character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve
% predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters
% the async’s decision-making in combat situations by
% making the best course of action more clear, and so
% provides a +10 bonus to both Initiative and Fray Tests.

% QUALIA

% PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Quick

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)


%  STRAIN MOD: –1
% The async can temporarily increase their intuitive
% grasp of things. In game terms, Intuition is raised by
% 5 for the chosen duration. This boost to Intuition also
% raises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.

% SAVANT CALCULATION

% PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:    Automatic


% RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Constant
% The character possesses an incredible facility with
% intuitive mathematics. They can do everything from
% calculate the odds exactly when gambling to predict-
% ing precisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land
% by observing the landscape and local wind currents.
% The character specializes in calculation involving the
% activity of complex chaotic systems and so can calcu-
% late answers that even the fastest computers could not,
% including things like patterns of rubble distribution
% from an explosion. However, this mathematic facility
% is largely intuitive, so the character does not know the
% equations they are solving, they merely know the solu-
% tion to the problem.

% This sleight also provides a +30 modifier to any
% skill tests involving math (which the character is cal-
% culating, not a computer).
% SENSORY BOOST

% PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Quick

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)


%  STRAIN MOD: –2
% An async uses this sleight to increase their natural or
% augmented sensory perception (sight, audio, smell,
% augmented) by enhanced cerebral processing, grant-
% ing a +20 bonus modifier on sensory-based Perception
% Tests.

% SUPERIOR KINESICS

% PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:    Automatic

%  RANGE:     Self          DURATION: Constant
% The async acquires more insight into people’s emo-
% tive signals, gestures, facial expressions, and body
% language when it comes time to predict the person’s
% emotional state, intent, or reactions. Apply a +10
% modifier to Kinesics Skill Tests.

% TIME SENSE

% PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Automatic

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)


%  STRAIN MOD: –1
% An async with this ability can slow down his per-
% ception of time, making everything appear to move
% in slow motion or at reduced speed. In game terms,
% this sleight grants the async a Speed of +1. This extra
% Action Phase, however, can only be spent on mental
% and mesh actions.

% UNCONSCIOUS LEAD

% PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Automatic

% RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)


%  STRAIN MOD: +0
% This sleight allows the async to override their con-
% sciousness and let their unconscious mind take point.
% While in this state, the async’s conscious mind is only
% dimly aware of what is transgressing, and any memo-
% ries of this period will be hazy at best. The advantage
% is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and
% so the async’s Speed is boosted by +1. The character
% remains aware and active, but is incapable of com-
% plex communication or other mental actions and is
% motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than
% conscious thought. Though it is recommended that
% the player retain control of their character while using
% Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to
% direct the character’s actions as they see fit.

% %%% txt/228.txt
% PSI-GAMMA SLEIGHTS

% Psi-gamma sleights deal with contacting (reading
% and communicating) and influencing the function of
% biological minds (egos within a biomorph, but also
% including animal life). Psi-gamma is only available to
% characters with Level 2 of the Psi trait.

% Most psi-gamma use is handled as an Opposed Test
% between the async and the target (p. 222).

% ALIENATION

%  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex

%  RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)

%  STRAIN MOD: +0             SKILL:    Psi Assault
% Alienation is an offensive sleight that create a sense of
% disconnection between an ego and its morph—similar
% to that experienced when resleeved into a new body.
% The ego finds their body cumbersome, strange, and
% alien, almost like they are a prisoner within it. If the
% async beats the target in an Opposed Test, treat the
% test as a failed Integration Test (p. 272) for the target.
% This effect lasts for the sleight’s duration.

% CHARISMA

%  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Quick

%  RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Minutes)

%  STRAIN MOD: –1           SKILL:   Control
% The async uses this sleight to influence the target’s
% mind on a subconscious level, so that the target per-
% ceives them to be charming, magnetic, and persuasive.
% If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they
% gain a +30 modifier on all subsequent Social Skill
% Tests for the chosen duration.

% CLOUD MEMORY

%  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex

%  RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Minutes)

%  STRAIN MOD: –1             SKILL:   Control
% Cloud Memory allows the async to temporarily dis-
% rupt the target’s ability to form long-term memories. If
% the async wins the Opposed Test, the target’s memory-
% saving ability is negated for the duration. The target
% will retain short-term memories during this time, but
% will soon forget anything that occurred while this
% sleight was in effect.

% DEEP SCAN

%  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex

%  RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Sustained

%  STRAIN MOD: +1            SKILL:    Sense
% Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought
% Browse (p. 228), made to extract information from the
% targeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the
% async telepathically invades the target’s mind and can
% probe it for information. For every 10 full points of MoS
% the async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece
% of information. Each item takes one full Action Turn to
% retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The
% target is aware of this mental probing, though they will
% not know what information the async acquired.

% DRIVE EMOTION

% PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:        Touch       DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)

%  STRAIN MOD: –1            SKILL:   Control
% This sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas
% of the target’s brain related to emotion. This allows
% the async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific
% emotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async
% beats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in ac-
% cordance with the emotion for the duration and under
% certain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties
% (up to +/–30), as determined by the gamemaster. For
% example, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation
% Test modifier against a target imbued with fear.

% EGO SENSE

% PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:        Close       DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)


% STRAIN MOD: –1           SKILL:   Sense
% Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and
% location of other sentient and biological life forms
% (i.e., egos) within the async’s range. To detect these
% life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, op-
% posed by each life form within range. The async may
% suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and
% insects, similar to the modifier applied for target-
% ing them in ranged combat (see p. 193); likewise, a
% modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be
% applied. If successful, the async has detected that the
% life form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will
% ascertain another piece of information regarding the
% detected life: direction from async, approximate size,
% type of creature, distance from async, etc. The async
% will know if the target moves, if they do so during the
% sleight’s duration.

% EMPATHIC SCAN

% PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Quick

% RANGE:        Close       DURATION:   Sustained

%  STRAIN MOD: –2             SKILL:    Sense
% Empathic Scan enables the async to sense the target’s
% base emotions. If the async wins the Opposed Test,
% they intuitively feel the target’s emotional current state
% for as long as the sleight is sustained. At the gamemas-
% ter’s discretion, this knowledge may provide a modifier
% (up to +30) for certain Social skill tests.

% IMPLANT MEMORY

% PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:        Touch       DURATION:   Instant

% STRAIN MOD:   +0          SKILL:      Control

% %%% txt/229.txt
% An async using this sleight can implant a memory
% of up to an hour’s length inside the target’s mind.
% This memory very obviously does not belong to the
% target—there is no way they will confuse it for one
% of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but
% to place one of the async’s memories in the target’s
% mind so that the target can access it just like any other
% memory. This can be useful for “archiving” important
% data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspec-
% tive, or simply making a “data dump” for the target
% to peruse. Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test
% against unwilling participants. At the gamemaster’s
% discretion, particularly traumatic memories might
% inflict mental stress on the recipient (p. 215).

% IMPLANT SKILL

%  PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex

%  RANGE:      Touch        DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)



% STRAIN MOD: +0          SKILL:   Control
% Similar to Implant Memory, this sleight allows the
% async to impart some of their expertise and implant it
% into the target’s mind. For the duration of the sleight,
% the target benefits when using that skill. If the async’s
% skill is between 31 and 60, the target receives a +10
% bonus. If the async’s skill is 61+, the target receives
% a +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test
% against unwilling participants. In some cases, the
% target has been known to use the skill with the async’s
% flair and mannerisms.

% MIMIC

%  PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Quick

%  RANGE:      Close        DURATION:   Instant

% STRAIN MOD: +0         SKILL:   Sense
% In a setting where changing your body and face is
% not unusual, people learn to recognize habits and
% personality quirks more often. The async must use
% this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test.
% If successful, the async acquires an “imprint” of the
% target’s mind that they can take advantage of when
% impersonating that ego. The async then receives a +30
% bonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the
% target’s behavior and social cues.

% MINDLINK

% PSI TYPE:     Active                 ACTION:     Quick

% RANGE:        Touch                  DURATION:   Sustained

% STRAIN MOD:                SKILL:


%             +1/target after first  Control
% Mindlink allows two-way mental communication
% with a target. This may be used on more than one
% target simultaneously, in which case the async can act
% as a telepathic “server,” so that everyone mindlinked
% with the async may also telepathically communicate
% with each other (via the async, however, so they
% overhear). Language is still a factor in mindlinked
% communications, but this barrier may be overcome by
% transmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sen-
% sations. Mindlink requires an Opposed Test against
% unwilling participants.

% OMNI AWARENESS

% PSI TYPE:     Active                 ACTION:     Quick

% RANGE:        Close                  DURATION: Temp (Minutes)


%  STRAIN MOD: –1           SKILL:    Sense
% An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to
% other biological life that is observing them. During
% this sleight’s duration, the async makes a Sense Test
% that is opposed by any life that has focused their at-
% tention on them within the sleight’s range; if success-
% ful, the async knows they are being watched, but not
% by whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Per-
% ception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does
% not register partial attention or fleeting attention, or
% simple perception of the async, it only notices targets

% %%% txt/230.txt
% who are actively observing (even if they are concealing
% their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a
% tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.

% PENETRATION

%  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Quick

%  RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Instant


% STRAIN MOD: 1 per AP point SKILL:  Psi Assault
% Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with
% any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill.
% It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an op-
% ponent by concentrating their psi attack. Every point
% of Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts
% 1 point of strain. The maximum AP that may be ap-
% plied equals the async’s Psi Assault skill divided by 10
% (round down).

% PSI SHIELD

%  PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic

%  RANGE:      Self         DURATION: Constant
% Psi Shield bolsters the async’s mind to psi attack and
% manipulation. If the async is hit by a psi attack, they
% receive WIL ÷ 5 (round up) points of armor, reducing
% the amount of damage inflicted. They also receive a
% +10 modifier when resisting any other sleights.

% PSYCHIC STAB

%  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex

%  RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Instant

%  STRAIN MOD: +0           SKILL:    Psi Assault
% Psychic Stab is an offensive sleight that seeks to inflict

% ing a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind
% of the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the
% recipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was
% their own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short
% and simple; as a rule of thumb, the gamemaster may
% only suggestions encompassed by a short sentence
% (for example: “open the airlock,” or “hand over the
% weapon”). At the gamemaster’s discretion, the target
% may receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are
% immediately life threatening (“jump off the bridge”)
% or that violate their motivations or personal strictures.

%  PSYCHOSURGERY
%  Given the reach of neuroscience in the time of
%  Eclipse Phase, it is easy to think of the mind as
%  programmable software, as something that can be
%  reverse-engineered, re-coded, upgraded, and patched.
%  To a large degree, this is true. Aided by nanotechnol-
%  ogy, genetics, and cognitive science, neuroscientists
%  have demolished numerous barriers to understand-
%  ing the mind’s structure and functions, and even
%  made great leaps in unveiling the true nature of
%  consciousness. Genetic tweaks, neuro-mods, and
%  neural implants offer an assortment of options for
%  improving the brain’s capabilities. The transhuman
%  mind has become a playground—and a battlefield.
%  Nanovirii unleashed during the Fall infected mil-
%  lions, altering their brains in permanent ways, with
%  occasional outbreaks still occurring a decade later.
%  Cognitive virii roam the mesh, plaguing infomorphs
%  and AIs, reprogramming mind states. An “infectious
%  idea” is now a literal term.

%  In truth, mind editing is not an easy, safe, and
%  error-proof process—it is difficult, dangerous, and
%  often flawed. Neuroscience may be light years
%  ahead of where it was a century ago, but there are
%  many aspects of the brain and neural functions
%  that continue to confound and elude even the
%  brightest experts and AIs. Technologies like nano-
%  neural mapping, uploading, digital mind emulation,
%  and artifi cial intelligence are also comparatively
%  in their infancy, being mere decades old. Though
%  transhumanity has a handle on how to make these

% leftovers, and randomly modified by an unlimited

% array of life events and environmental factors. Every

% mind features numerous mechanisms—cells, con-

% nections, receptors—that handle a dizzying array

% of functions: memory, perception, learning, reason-

% ing, emotion, instinct, consciousness, and more. Its

% system of organization and storage is holonomic,

% diffused, and disorganized. Even the genetically-

% modified and enhanced brains of transhumans are

% crowded, chaotic, cross-wired places, with each

% mind storing its memories, personality, and other

% defining features in unique ways.


% What this means is that though the general ar-

% chitecture and topography of neural networks can

% be scanned and deduced, the devil is in the details.

% Techniques used to modify, repair, or enhance one

% person’s mind are not guaranteed equal success

% when applied to another’s brain. For example, the

% process by which brains store knowledge, skills, and

% memories results in a strange chaining process where

% these memories are linked and associated with other

% memories, so attempts to alter one memory can

% have adverse affects on other memories. In the end,

% minds are slippery and dodgy things, and attempts

% to reshape them rarely go as planned.


% THE PROCESS OF PSYCHOSURGERY

% Psychosurgery is the process of selective, surgical altera-

% tion of a transhuman mind. It is a separate field from

% neural genetic modification (which alters genetic code),

% neuralware implantation (adding cybernetic or biotech

% inserts to the brain or nervous system), or brain hacking

% (software attacks on computer brains, neural inserts, and

% infomorphs), though they are sometimes combined.


%  Psychosurgery is almost always performed on a

% digital mind-state, whether that be a real-time emula-

% tion, a backup, or a fork. In most cases, the subject’s

% mind-state is copied via the same technology and pro-

% cess as uploading or forking, and run in a simulspace.

% The subject need not be willing, and in these cases

% the subject’s permissions are restricted. Numerous

% psychosurgery simulspace environments are available,

% each custom-designed for facilitating specific psy-

% chosurgical goals and programmed with a thorough

% selection of psychotherapy treatment options.

% The actual process of psychosurgery breaks down
% into several stages. First is diagnosis, which can
% involve the use of several neuro-imaging techniques
% on morphed characters, mapping synaptic connec-
% tions, and building a neurochemical model. It can
% also involve complete psychological profiling and
% psychometric behavioral testing, including personal-
% ity tests and simulspace scenario simulations. Digital
% mind-states can be compared to records of people
% with similar symptoms in order to identify related
% information clusters. This analysis is used to plan
% the procedure.

% The actual implementation of psychosurgical al-
% teration can involve several methods, depending on
% the desired results. Applying external modules to the
% mind-state is often the best approach, as it doesn’t
% meddle with complicated connections and new inputs
% are readily interpreted and assimilated. For treat-
% ments, mental health software patches compiled from
% databases of healthy minds are matched, customized,
% and applied. Specialized programs may be run to
% stimulate certain mental processes for therapeutic
% purposes. Before an alteration is even applied, it may
% first be performed on a fork of the subject and run at
% accelerated speeds to evaluate the outcome. Likewise,
% multiple treatment choices may be applied to time-ac-
% celerated forks this way, allowing the psychosurgeon
% to test which is likely to work best.

% Not all psychosurgery is performed for the subject’s
% benefit, of course. Psychosurgery can be used to inter-
% rogate or torture prisoners, erase memories, modify
% behavior, or inflict crippling impairments. It is also
% sometimes used for legal punishment purposes, in
% an attempt to impair criminal activity. Needless to
% say, such methods are often brute-forced rather than
% fine-tuned, ignoring safety parameters and sometimes
% resulting in detrimental side effects.
% PSYCHOSURGERY MECHANICS
% In game terms, psychosurgery is handled as a Task
% Action requiring an Opposed Test. The psychosurgeon
% rolls Psychosurgery skill against the target’s WIL x 3.
% Apply modifiers as appropriate from the Psychosur-
% gery Modifiers table.

% If the psychosurgeon succeeds and the subject fails,
% the psychosurgery is effective and permanent. The
% alteration becomes a permanent part of the subject’s
% ego, and will be copied when uploaded (and some-
% times when forking).

% If both sides succeed but the psychosurgeon rolls
% higher, the psychosurgery is effective but temporary. It
% lasts for 1 week per 10 points of MoS.

% If the subject rolls higher, or if the psychosurgeon
% fails their roll, the attempt does not work.

% The timeframe listed for psychosurgical procedures
% is according to the patient’s subjective point of view.
% Since most subjects are treated in a simulspace, time
% acceleration may drastically reduce the amount of
% real-time such a procedure requires (see Defying Na-
% ture’s Laws, pp. 240–241).

% MENTAL STRESS
% Psychosurgery is a modification to the transhuman
% mind, and sometimes to the actual person that resides
% in that mind. It is unsurprising then that psychosur-
% gery places stress on the subject’s mental state and
% sometimes even inflicts mental traumas.

% Each psychosurgery option lists a Stress Value
% (SV) that is infl icted on the subject regardless of
% the tests’ success or failure. If the psychosurgeon
% achieves an Excellent Success (MoS 30+), this stress
% is halved (round down). If the psychosurgeon rolls
% a Severe Failure (MoF 30+), the stress is doubled.
% Alternately, a Severe Failure could result in unin-
% tended side effects, such as affecting other behav-
% iors, emotions, or memories.

% %%% txt/233.txt

% If a critical success is rolled, no stress is applied at
% all. If a critical failure is rolled, however, an automatic
% trauma is applied in addition to the normal stress.

% Some psychosurgery conditions may also affect the
% SV, as noted on the Psychosurgery Modifiers table.

% ROLEPLAYING MIND EDITS
% Many of the changes incurred by psychosurgery are
% nebulous and difficult to pin down with game me-
% chanics. Alterations to a character’s personality and
% mind-state are often better handled as roleplaying fac-
% tors anyway. This means that players should make a
% real effort to integrate any such mental modifications
% into their character’s words and actions, and game-
% masters should ensure that a character’s portrayal
% plays true to their mind edits. Some psychosurgical
% mods can be reflected with ego traits, while others
% might incur modifiers to certain tests or in certain
% situations. The gamemaster should carefully weigh a
% brain alteration’s effects, and apply modifiers as they
% see appropriate.

% PSYCHOSURGERY PROCEDURES

% The following alterations may be accomplished
% with psychosurgery. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
% other mind-editing procedures may be attempted,
% using these as a guideline.

% BEHAVIORAL CONTROL

%  TIMEFRAME:   1 week


%             Limit/Boost –10; Block/Encourage –20,

%  PM:


%             Expunge/Enforce –30

%  SV:         (1d10 ÷ 2, round up)
% Commonly used for criminal rehabilitation, behavioral
% control attempts to limit, block, or expunge a specific
% behavior from the subject’s psyche. For example, a
% murderer may be conditioned against acts of aggres-
% sion, or a kleptomaniac might be restricted from steal-
% ing. Some people seek this adjustment willingly, such
% as socialite glitterati who restrict their desire to eat, or
% an addict who cuts out their craving for a fix.

% Behavioral control can also be applied as an un-
% leashing or reinforcement. A companion may desire
% to eliminate their sexual inhibitions, for example, or
% a hypercorp exec may boost his commitment to place
% work above all else.

% A character will simply feel compelled to avoid
% a behavior that is limited (perhaps suffering a –10
% modifier), but will find it quite difficult to pursue a be-
% havior that is blocked (requiring a WIL x 3 Test, and
% suffering a –20 modifier). They will find themselves
% completely incapable of initiating a behavior that is
% expunged, and if forced into the behavior will suffer
% a –30 modifier and (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) points of
% mental Stress.

% Likewise, a character will feel compelled to pursue a
% behavior that is boosted, and will find it hard to avoid
%  engaging in a behavior that is encouraged (requiring a
%  WIL x 3 Test to avoid). They will have no choice but
%  to engage in enforced behaviors, and will suffer (1d10
%  ÷ 2, round up) points of mental Stress if prevented
%  from doing so.

%  BEHAVIORAL MASKING


%  TIMEFRAME:   1 week


%  PM:          –20


%  SV:       1d10 ÷ 2, round up

%  Given the ability to switch bodies, many security
%  and law enforcement agencies have resorted to per-
%  sonality and behavioral profiling as a means of iden-
%  tifying people even when they resleeve. Though such
%  systems are far from perfect, someone’s unconscious
%  habits and quirks could potentially give them away.
%  Characters who wish to elude identification in this
%  way may undergo behavioral masking, which seeks
%  to alter and change the character’s unconscious habits
%  and social cues. Apply a +30 modifier when defending
%  against such identification systems and Kinesics Tests.

%  DEEP LEARNING


%  TIMEFRAME:   Skill Learning Time +2


%  PM:          +20


% SV:        1

%  Using tutorial programs, memory reinforcement
%  protocols, conditioning tasks, and deep brain stimula-
%  tion, the subject’s learning ability is reinforced, allow-
%  ing them to learn new skills more quickly.

%  EMOTIONAL CONTROL


%  TIMEFRAME:   1 week


%               Limit/Boost –10; Block/Encourage –20,


%  PM:


%               Expunge/Enforce –30


%  SV:      (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) + 2

%  Similar to behavioral control, emotional control
%  seeks to modify, enhance, or restrict the subject’s
%  emotional responses. Some choose these modifica-
%  tions willingly, such as limiting sadness in order to
%  be happier, or encouraging aggression in order to be
%  more competitive. Mercenaries and soldiers have been
%  known to expunge fear. Follow the same rules as given
%  for Behavioral Control.

% INTERROGATION

%  TIMEFRAME:   Variable (gamemaster discretion; 1 week default)

%  PM:          +30

%  SV:       1d10

% Psychosurgery can be used for interrogative pur-
% poses via the application of mental torture and ma-
% nipulation. A successful Psychosurgery Test applies a
% +30 modifier to the Intimidation Test for interrogation.

% MEMORY EDITING

%  TIMEFRAME:   1 week (2 weeks adding/replacing)

%  PM:          –10 (willing) or –30 (forced)

%  SV:       (1d10 ÷ 2, round up)

% By monitoring memory recall (forcibly invoked
% if necessary), psychosurgeons can identify where
% memories are stored in the brain and target them for
% removal. Memory storage is complex and diffused,
% however, and often linked to other memories, so re-
% moving one memory may affect others (gamemaster
% discretion).

% Adding or replacing memories is a much more com-
% plicated operation and requires that such memories be
% copied from someone who has experienced them or
% manufactured with XP software. Even when success-
% fully implanted, fake memories may clash with other
% (real) memories unless those are also erased.

% PERSONALITY EDITING

%  TIMEFRAME:   1 week

%  PM:          Minor –10; Moderate –20, Major –30

%  SV:        (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) + 3

% Possibly the most drastic psychosurgery procedure,
% personality editing involves altering the subject’s core
% personality traits. The personality factors that may be
% modified is almost unlimited, including traits such as
% openness, conscientiousness, altruism, extroversion/
% introversion, impulsiveness, curiosity, creativity, con-
% fidence, sexual orientation, and self-control, among
% others. These traits may be enhanced or reduced to
% varying degrees. The effect is largely reflected by role-
% playing, but the gamemaster may apply modifiers as
% they see fit.

% PSYCHOTORTURE

%  TIMEFRAME:   Variable

%  PM:          +30

%  SV:       1d10 SV per day

% Psychotorture is mental manipulation for the simple
% intention of causing pain and anguish, reflected in
% game terms as mental stress and traumas. Prolonged
% torture can lead to serious mental disorders or worse.
% PSYCHOTHERAPY

%  TIMEFRAME:   Variable

%  PM:          +0

%  SV:        0

% Therapeutic psychosurgery is beneficial for charac-
% ters suffering from mental stress, traumas, and disor-
% ders. A successful Psychosurgery Test applies a +30
% modifier to mental healing tests, as noted on p. 215.

% SKILL IMPRINTS

%  TIMEFRAME:   1 week per +10

%  PM:          +0

%  SV:        1 per +10

% Skill imprinting is the use of psychosurgery to insert
% skill-set neural patterns in the subject’s brain, tempo-
% rarily boosting their ability. Skill imprints are artificial
% boosts, however, degrading at the rate of –10 per day.
% No skill may be boosted higher than 60.

% SKILL SUPPRESSION

%  TIMEFRAME:   1 day per –10

%  PM:          –10

%  SV:       1 per +10

% Skill suppression attempts to identify where skills
% are stored in the brain and then block or remove
% them. The subject’s skill is impaired and may be lost
% entirely.

% TASPING

%  TIMEFRAME:   1 day

%  PM:          +10

%  SV:         1

% Tasping is the use of deep brain stimulation tech-
% niques to tickle the mind’s pleasure centers. Though
% this procedure is often used for therapeutic purposes
% for patients suffering from depression or other mental
% illnesses, the intent with tasping is to overload the
% subject into a prolonged state of almost unendurable
% bliss. Such stimulation is highly addictive, however, so
% character’s exposed to it for any length of time (over
% 1 hour, subjective) are likely to pick up the Addiction
% trait (p. 148). Some criminal organizations have been
% known to use tasping addiction and rewards as a
% means of controlling those under their thrall.

% MESH

% Before the Fall, humanity interfaced with each other

% through the internet, interconnected networks that

% served as the technical backbone for the evolv-

% ing world wide web. While it began as a electronic

% medium for retrieving information from various

% sources (replacing even older paper-based info-

% sources), succeeding generations emphasized digital

% communities and hosted services such as networking

% sites, wikis, blogs, and folksonomies. These facili-

% tated openness, collaboration, and sharing, thereby

% laying the groundwork for a modern, interconnected

% information society. Further stages emphasized wire-

% less interaction, geolocation, and semantic web ap-

% proaches and achieved quantum leaps in the realm

% of user interaction with the advent of brain-computer

% interfaces, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality

% (VR), and experience playback (XP).


%  This environment, coupled with the exponential

% growth of processing power and memory storage, cre-

% ated an evolutionary path for the development of intel-

% ligent agents—designed to augment human informa-

% tion processing—that then transformed into artificial

% intelligences (AIs) in the following decades. While these

% “weak” AIs did not possess the full range of human

% cognitive abilities, tended towards overspecialization,

% and were restrained by programmed limitations, the

% digital evolution toward artificial general intelligences

% (AGIs)—”strong” AIs with intelligence capabilities

% that equaled or exceeded human abilities—could not

% be halted. From this point it was but a matter of time

% before so-called seed AI would come into existence,

% machine minds capable of recursive self-improvement,

% leading to an exponential growth in intelligence. Un-

% fortunately for humanity, the TITANs were the result.


%  Even before the Fall, however, the internet of old

% was transforming into something new. Instead of con-

% necting via central servers, users were wirelessly link-

% ing to each other, creating a decentralized intermeshed

% network of handheld devices, personal computers,

% robots, and electronic devices. Users were online all of

% the time and connected with everything and everyone

% around them in a ubiquitous computing environment.

% This was especially true of those participating in

% humanity’s expansion into space. Disconnected from

% the internet due to distance and light-speed commu-

% nication lags, these users were nevertheless connected

% with all of the people and objects in their nearby

% environment or habitat, creating local wireless mesh

% networks. Thus was the mesh born, taking the place

% of the old internet of earth, lost during the Fall.




% MESH CAPABILITIES

% The mesh, as it exists in Eclipse Phase, is only possible

% thanks to major developments made in computer and

% communication technologies and nanofabrication.

%  Wireless radio transmitters and receivers are so unob-
%  trusively tiny that they can literally be factored into
%  anything. As a result, everything is computerized and
%  connected, or at least tagged with a radio frequency
%  ID (RFID) chip. Even food is tagged with edible chips,
%  complete with expiration date and nutritional content.
%  Other communications mediums, such as laser and
%  microwave links, add to the information flow.

%  Data storage technology has advanced to such high
%  levels that even an individual user’s surplus storage
%  capacity can maintain an amount of information
%  easily surpassing the entire 20th-century internet.
%  Lifeloggers can literally record every moment of their
%  life and never fear about running out of room. The
%  amount of data that people carry around in the mesh
%  inserts in their head or in portable ecto personal com-
%  puters is staggering.

%  Processing capabilities also exist at hyper-efficient
%  levels. Even massive supercomputers are a thing of the
%  past when modest handheld devices can fulfill almost
%  all of your needs, even while simultaneously running a
%  personal AI assistant, downloading media, uploading
%  porn, and scanning thousands of newsfeeds. Within
%  the mesh network, devices that near their processing
%  limits simply share the burden with devices around
%  them, creating a massively distributed framework that
%  in some ways is like an entire supercomputer to itself,
%  shared by everyone.

%  Similarly, transmission capacity now far exceeds
%  most citizens’ definition of need. Anyone born within
%  the last several generations has always lived in a world
%  in which hyper-realistic, multi-sensory media of nearly
%  any length is available for instantaneous download
%  or upload from anywhere. Massive databases and
%  archives are copied back and forth with ease. Band-
%  width is such a non-issue that most people forget it ever
%  was. In fact, given the sheer amount of data available,
%  finding the information or media you’re looking for
%  takes considerably longer than downloading it. The
%  mesh is also never down. As a decentralized network,
%  if any one device is taken offline, connections merely
%  route around it, finding a path via the thousands if not
%  millions of available nodes. Similarly, the entire mesh
%  behaves like a peer-to-peer network, so that large trans-
%  fers are broken into manageable chunks that take inde-
%  pendent routes. In fact, most users maintain personal
%  torrent archives that are publicly accessible and shared.

%  Private networks still exist, of course. Some are
%  physically walled away behind closed-access wired net-
%  works or even wireless-inhibiting infrastructure that
%  keep a network isolated and contained. Most, however,
%  operate on top of the public mesh, using encrypted
%  tunneling protocols that provide private and secure
%  communications over unsecured networks. In other
%  words, these private networks are part of the mesh
%  along with everything else, but only the participants

%  MESHING TECHNOLOGIES
%  Almost all biomorphs in the solar system are equipped
%  with basic mesh inserts (p. 300)—implanted personal
%  computers. These implants are grown in the brain via
%  non-intrusive nanosurgery. The processor, wireless
%  transceiver, storage devices, and other components
%  are directly wired to the user’s cerebral neuronal cells
%  and cortical centers responsible for language, speech,
%  and visual perception among others. Thought-to-
%  communication emulations (so called transducing)
%  enables the user to control the implant just by think-
%  ing and to communicate without vocalizing. Input
%  from the mesh inserts is transmitted directly into the

% of news, media, discourse, knowledge, environmental
% data, business, and culture. Transhumans embrace
% the mesh as a tool for exchange, communication,
% and participation with other users, both local and far
% away. As such, the mesh is an up-to-date, authoritative
% source on all transhuman knowledge and activities.

% Not everything online is available for free, of course,
% except perhaps in the autonomist zones. Quite a bit of
% proprietary data is kept off the grid in secure storage
% or sequestered away in private networks. Some of this
% is for sale, and heavily encumbered with digital restric-
% tions—software, media, nanofabrication blueprints,

% free and open source alternatives to much proprietary
% data, however, and numerous digital piracy groups
% deal out cracked versions of proprietary material,
% despite pressure from some authorities. Other data is
% simply secured from competitive interests (hypercorp
% research projects) or is an extremely private affair,
% such as ego backups.

% SPIMES
% Along with the accumulated data of transhuman
% affairs, the mesh is also cluttered with information
% derived from untold numbers of wireless-capable sen-
% sor-enabled devices that continuously update the mesh
% with their location, sensor recordings, and other data.
% Colloquially called “spimes,” these location-aware,
% environment-aware, self-logging, self-documenting
% objects broadcast their data to anyone who cares to
% listen. Since visual, auditory, and other sensors are
% absurdly tiny and inexpensive, they are ubiquitously
% incorporated into nearly every object or product a
% person might wear, apply, use, or internalize. This
% allows almost any user to reach out through the mesh
% and gather environmental data and ambient sensor
% recordings from a specific location (or at least public
% locales—private areas typically block such signals or
% slave them to a local AI that filters their output).

% SURVEILLANCE, PRIVACY, AND SOUSVEILLANCE
% While spimes are easily trackable, they also con-
% tribute to an environment of universal surveillance.
% Between spimes, microsensors, ubiquitous security
% systems, and the recording capabilities of the mesh
% inserts used by almost everyone, just about every-
% thing is recorded. Factor in the availability of mesh-
% tracking, facial recognition, rep/social networks, and
% other data mining software, and it rapidly becomes
% clear that privacy is an outdated concept. Special
% considerations must be embraced by anyone that
% seeks to mask their identity or cover their movements.
% Alternately, off-the-shelf looks common with some
% morphs (especially synthmorphs and pods) allow a
% user to blend in with the masses.

% Though in part this may seem an Orwellian sur-
% veillance nightmare, the abundance of recording
% tech actually works as “sousveillance” (watching
% from below), serving a role in making everything
% transparent and putting checks on abuses of power.

% %%% txt/241.txt
% Authoritarian regimes tread carefully, as they are also
% universally monitored, despite their attempts to con-
% trol information flow. Many people also willing par-

% nearly infinite storage capacity, dedicated lifeloggers
% record every moment of their lives and share it for
% others to experience.



% INTERFACING: AR, VR, AND XP
% Mesh media is accessed using one of three protocols:
% augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), or expe-
% rience playback (XP).

% AUGMENTED REALITY
%  Most users perceive data from the mesh as aug-
%  mented reality—information overlaid on the user’s
%  physical senses. For example, computer-generated
%  graphics will appear as translucent images, icons,
%  or text in the user’s field of vision. While visual AR
%  data—called entoptic data—is the most common,
%  other senses may also be used. AR is not limited
%  to visuals, however, and can also include acoustic
%  sounds and voices, odors, tastes, and even tactile
%  sensations. This sensory data is high-resolution and
%  seemingly “real,” though it is usually presented as
%  something ghostly or otherwise artificial so as not
%  to be confused with real-world interactions (and
%  also to meet safety regulations).

% User interfaces are customized to the user’s prefer-
%  ences and needs, both graphically and content-wise.
%  Filters allow users to access the information they
%  are interested in without needing to worry about
%  extraneous data. While AR data is typically placed
%  in the user’s normal field of vision, entoptics are not
%  actually limited by this and may be viewed in the
% “mind’s eye.” Nevertheless, icons, windows and other
%  interaction prompts can be layered, stacked, toggled,
%  hidden, or shifted out of the way if necessary to in-
%  teract with the physical world.

% AVATARS
% Every mesh represents themselves online via a digi-
% tal avatar. Many people use digital representations
% of themselves, whereas other prefer more iconic
% designs. This may be an off-the-shelf look or a
% customized icon. Libraries of avatars may also be
% employed, enabling a user to switch their represen-
% tation according to mood. Avatars are what other
% users see when they deal with you online—i.e., how
% you are represented in AR. Most avatars are ani-
% mated and programmed to reflect the user’s actual
% mood and speech, so that the avatar seems to speak
% and have emotions.

% E-TAGS
% Entoptic tags are a way for people to “tag” a physical
% person, place, or object with a piece of virtual data.
% These e-tags are stored in networks local to the tagged
% item, and move with the item if it changes location.
% INFORMATION AT
% YOUR FINGERTIPS
% The following information is always available for m
% mesh users in a normal habitat:

% LOCAL CONDITIONS
% • Local maps showing your current location, annotated with

% local features of personal interest (according to your perso

% preferences and filters) and your distance from them/direct

% to them. Details regarding private and restricted areas (gov

% ment/hypercorp areas, maintenance/security infrastructure,

% are usually not included.
% • Current habitat life support (climate) conditions including

% atmosphere composition, temperature.
% • Current solar system and habitat orbit maps with trajectory

% plots, communication delays.
% • Local businesses/services, directions, and details.

% LOCAL MESH
% • Public search engines, databases, mesh sites, blogs, forums

% archives, along with new content alerts.
% • Syndicated public newsfeeds in a variety of formats, filtered

% according to your preferences.
% • Sensor/spime (mostly audio-visual) feeds from any public a

% of the habitat.
% • Private network resources (including tactical nets).
% • Automatic searches for new online references to your nam

% and other subjects of interest.
% • E-tags pertaining to local people, places, or things.
% • Facial/image recognition searches of public mesh/archives

% match a photo/vid still.

% PERSONAL INFORMATION
% • Morph status indicators (medical and/or mechanical): blood

% pressure, heart rate, temperature, white cell count, nutrient

% levels, implant status and functionality, etc.
% • Location, functionality, sensor feeds, and status reports of y

% possessions (via sensors and transmitters in these possessi
% • Access to one’s life-spanning personal audio-visual/XP arch
% • Access to one’s life-spanning personal file archive (music, s

% ware, media, documents, etc.).
% • Credit account status and transactions.

% SOCIAL NETWORKS
% • Communications account status: calls, messages, files, etc.
% • Reputation score and feedback.
% • Social network status, friend updates.
% • Updated event calendar and alerts.
% • The public social network profiles of those around you.
% • The location and status of those nearby and involved in the

% same AR games as you.

% %%% txt/242.txt
%  E-tags are viewable in AR, and can hold almost any
%  type of data, though short notes and pictures are the
%  most common. E-tags are often linked to particular
%  social networks or circles within that network, so that
%  people can leave notes, reviews, memorabilia media,
%  and similar things for friends and colleagues.

%  SKINNING
%  Since reality can be overlaid with entoptics of hyper-
%  real quality, modern users can “skin” their reality by
%  modifying their perceptual input. Environments around
%  them may be modified to fit their particular tastes or
%  mood. Need your spirits boosted? Pull up a skin that
%  makes it seems like your outdoors, with the sun shining
%  down, the sounds of gentle surf in the background, and
%  butterflies drifting lazily overhead. Pissed off? Be com-
%  forted as flames engulf the walls and thunder grumbles
%  ominously in the distance. It is not uncommon for
%  people to go about their day, accompanied by their own
%  personal soundtrack that only they can hear. Even ol-
%  factory and taste receptors can be artificially stimulated
%  to experience sensations like the smell of roses, fresh air,
%  or freshly-baked pastries. While originally developed
%  to make “space food” less distasteful and as a method
%  to counter space-induced cabin fever for those that
%  weren’t born in space, vast archives of aromas, tastes,
%  and environments are available for download.

%  Skins do not need to be kept private, they may
%  also be shared with others via the mesh. Tired of

% used mainly for recreation (gaming, virtual tourism,

% meetings are not possible), and training. Dedicated
% networks with high-capacity information processing
% are required to render and run large and complex
% hyper-real simulspaces with many users, and these
% are often hard-wired for additional stability. Smaller
% simulspaces capable of hosting a smaller amount of

% DEFYING NATURE’S LAWS
% A plethora of simulspace environments are available,
% ranging from simulations of real places to historical
% recreations to fantastic worlds representing almost
% every genre imaginable. All of these simulations are
% bolstered by the fact that possible scenarios are not
% bound by the laws of nature. The fundamental forces
% of reality and nature, like gravitation, electromag-
% netism, atmosphere, temperature, etc., are program-
% mable in VR, allowing for environments that are
% completely unnatural, such as escheresque simulspace
% where gravity is relative to position. These domain
% rules may be altered and manipulated according to
% the whim of the designer.

% Time itself is an adjustable constant in VR, though
% deviation from true time has its limits. So far, tran-
% shuman designers have achieved time dilation up to
% 60 times faster or slower than real time (roughly one
% minute equaling either one hour or one second). Time
% slowdown is far more commonly used, granting more
% time for simulspace recreational activities (more time,
% more fun!), learning, or work (economically effective).
% Time acceleration, on the other hand, is extremely
% useful for making long distance travel through space
% more tolerable.

% ACCESSING SIMULSPACES
% Most simulspaces can be accessed through the mesh
% just like any other node. Since VR takes over the
% user’s sensorium, however, and sometimes involves
% time perception dilation, users are cut off from other
% mesh-delivered sensory input and interacting directly
% with other nodes. Instead, outside mesh interactions
% are routed through the simulspace’s interface (mean-
% ing that a character may browse the mesh, communi-
% cate with others, etc. from inside a simulspace, if the
% domain rules allow it).

% Since physical senses are overridden when a user
% accesses VR, most people prefer to rest their body
% in a safe and comfortable environment while in the
% simulspace. Body-fitting cushions and couches help
% users relax and keep them from cramping up or in-
% juring themselves if they happen to thrash around.
% In case of long-term virtual sojourns (for instance,
% during space travel), morphs are normally retained
% in tanks that sustain them in terms of nutrition and
% oxygen. Many VR entertainment and game networks
% offer dedicated and hardwired physical VR cafes
% with private pods. Visitors rent a pod and physically
% jack in, using either access jacks or an ultrasonic
% trode net that reads and transmits brain patterns
% when placed on the head.

% When accessing a simulspace, the user first enters
% an electronic buffer “holding space” known as a
% white room. Here the user chooses a customizable
% avatar-like persona to represent them in the simul-
% space, called a simulmorph. From this point, the user
% immerses themself in the virtual reality environment,
% effectively becoming their simulmorph.
% EXPERIENCE PLAYBACK
% Every morph with mesh inserts has the capability
% to transmit or record their experiences, a form of
% technology called experience playback, or XP. Since
% the first programs were developed that provide a
% simple interface to “snapshot” ones experiences, it
% has become extremely popular to share XP with
% friends and social networks, or with the online public
% at large.

% The level of experiences depends on how much of
% the recorded sensory perception is kept when the clip
% is made. Full XP includes exteroceptive, interoceptive,
% and emotive tracks. Exteroceptive tracks include the
% traditional senses of sight, smell, hearing, touch, and
% taste that process the outside world. Interoceptive
% tracks include senses originating within the body, such
% as balance, a sense of motion, pain, hunger and thirst,
% and a general sense of the location of one’s own body
% parts. Emotive tracks include the whole spectrum of
% emotions which can be aroused in a transhumans.
% Due to the biological requirements (neuronal and
% endocrine systems) of expressing emotions, hardcore
% XP aficionados deem only the experience in and from
% biomorphs as the real deal.



% MESH USES
% There are many reasons people use the mesh. The
% foremost is communication: voice and video calls
% (typically displaying avatars rather than actual
% video), electronic messaging (e-mail, instant mes-
% saging, microblogging), and file and data transfers.
% Socializing is also key, handled via social and reputa-
% tion networks, personal profiles, lifelogging, chats
% and conferences (both AR and VR), and discussion
% groups and forums. Information gathering is also
% at the top, whether its browsing the popular Solar-
% chive or other databases and directories, tapping
% the latest newsfeeds, browsing mesh sites, tracking
% your friends, taking lessons in VR, or looking up just
% about anything conceivable. Recreation rounds out
% the pack, covering everything from gaming (AR and
% VR) to experiencing other people’s lives (XP) to VR
% tourism and club-hopping.

% PERSONAL AREA NETWORKS
% Since everything a person carries is meshed, most
% people maintain personal area networks that route
% all of these devices through their mesh inserts or ecto,
% which acts as a hub. This is both a security measure,
% ensuring they maintain control over their own acces-
% sories, and a convenience factor, as it focuses all of the
% controls in one place.

% VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS
% Virtual private networks (VPNs) are communica-
% tions networks tunneled through the mesh, which
% are dedicated for a specific group of people. The
% primary use of VPNs is to create privacy and secu-
% rity for its users, and so they typically use security

% %%% txt/244.txt
% features such as ego authentication and public key
% encryption. VPNs are regularly used to mesh mobile
% offices into a corporate network or mesh people to-
% gether who work on or contribute a certain project.
% Other VPNs—particularly social networks and rep
% networks—operate with minimal security features,
% simply serving as a network of specific users within
% the mesh and making it easier to keep in touch,
% transfer information, make updates, and so on. Most
% VPNs come as specialized software suites that run
% custom environmental software that integrates into
% the user’s normal mesh interface and AR.

% SOCIAL NETWORKS
% Social networks are the fabric of the mesh, weaving
% people together. They are the means by which most
% people keep in contact with their friends, colleagues,
% and allies, as well as current events, the latest trends,
% new memes, and other developments in shared
% interests. They are an exceptionally useful tool for
% online research, getting favors, and meeting new
% people. In some cases, they are useful for reaching
% or mobilizing masses of people (as often illustrated
% by anarchists and pranksters). There are thousands
% of social networks, each serving different cultural
% and professional interests and niches. Most social
% networks allow users to feature a public profile to
% the entire mesh and a private profile that only those
% close to them can access.

% Reputation plays a vital part in social networks,
% serving as a measure of each person’s social capital.
% Each person’s reputation score is available for lookup,
% along with any commentary posted by people who
% favored or disfavored them and rebuttals by the user.
% Many people automate their reputation interactions,
% instructing their muse to automatically ping some-
% one with a good review after a positive action and
% to likewise provide negative feedback to people with
% whom the interaction went poorly.

% MOBILE OFFICES
% Due to the lack of office space and the wireless ac-
% cessibility of most information, most businesses
% now operate virtually, with few or no fixed offices
% or even assets. Instead, individuals have become their
% own mobile office. Bit-pushers and bureaucrats like
% hypercorp executives, clerical workers, accountants,
% and researchers—as well as innovators like artists,
% writers, engineers, and designers—work wherever
% they want to.

% The most prominent example of this phenomenon
% are the bankers of the Solaris hypercorp. Each em-
% ployee acts as a mobile one-person banking office,
% managing transactions via Solaris’s robust VPN.

% On rare occasions, office environments are run
% in simulspace with time dilation to maximize effi-
% ciency. Since this requires the workers to access a
% centralized wired network and leave their bodies
% unattended while accessing simulspace, however, it
% requires an extra level of physical security that is
% typical only of some governmental installations and
% corporate habitats.



% ISLANDS IN THE NET
% In the time of Eclipse Phase, information can become
% outdated quite fast, and the accessibility of new infor-
% mation depends on your location. It’s easy to keep up-
% to-date on your local habitat/city or planetary body,
% but keeping current on events elsewhere is typically
% reliant on the speed of light.

% If you happen to be in a station in the Kuiper Belt,
% on the edge of the solar system 50 astronomical units
% from the terrestrial inner planets, waiting on a mes-
% sage from Mars, the signal carrying the message will
% be roughly seven hours old when it reaches you. Of
% course it will only reach you that fast if you are using
% quantum farcast, which is only limited by the speed
% of light (not to mention rare and expensive in most
% habitats). If you are not using a quantum farcaster,
% the signal may take even longer and is prone to in-
% terference and noise, deteriorating the quality and
% possibly losing some of the content, especially over
% major distances. Whenever you start dealing with
% communication between habitats, you have to factor
% in the light-speed lag, the amount of time it takes
% even the fastest transmission to reach you. This lag
% works both ways, so trying to hold a conversation
% with someone just 5 light-seconds away means that
% you’re waiting at least 10 seconds to get the reply
% to whatever you just said. For this reason, AR and
% VR communications are almost always conducted lo-
% cally, while standard messaging is used for nonlocal
% communications. For detailed discussions, it is often
% simpler to send a fork of yourself (p. 273) to have the
% conversation and then return.

% Quantum-entanglement communicators (p. 314)
% are one solution to this light-speed lag, although a
% burdensome and expensive one. QE comms allow
% for faster-than-light communication to an entangled
% communicator, though each transmission uses up a
% precious amount of quantum-entangled bits, which
% are in limited supply.

% Transmissions made between habitats almost
% always occur via each station’s massive data relays,
% where they are then distributed into the local mesh.
% This bottleneck is often used by authoritarian habitats
% to monitor data transmissions and even filter or censor
% certain public non-encrypted content. Some messages
% are also prioritized over others, potentially meaning
% further delays.

% %%% txt/245.txt

% The method of transmission between habitats also
% sometimes matters. Radio and neutrino broadcasts
% can be intercepted by anyone, whereas tight-beam
% laser or microwave links are specifically used as a
% point-to-point method that minimizes interception
% and eavesdropping. The use of quantum farcasting
% using neutrino systems is completely secure, however,
% and is the most frequently-used intra-habitat link.

% What these lags, bottlenecks, and prioritizations
% mean is that some news and data takes a particularly
% long-time to trickle from one local mesh network to
% another, passing slowly from habitat to habitat. This
% means that there are always gradients of information
% available to different local mesh networks, typically
% depending on proximity and the importance of the
% information. Some data even gets lost along the way,
% never making it further than a habitat or two before
% it is lost in the noise. The only way to retrieve such
% information is to track it down to its source.

% DARKCASTS
% “Darkcasts” are ranged communications that go out-
%  side of legal and approved channels. Since certain hab-
%  itats have strict regulations on transmission content,
%  forking, egocasting, infomorphs, muse abilities, and
% AGI code, underworld groups like the ID crew profit
%  by offering illegal data transmission services. Primarily
%  used for censored data and banned content (like illegal
% XPs or malware), local organized crime factions also
%  often offer egocasting services complete with resleev-
%  ing and leasable morphs, allowing egos that prefer
%  discretion to enter or leave a habitat without drawing
%  attention. Though such authorities hunt down these
%  darkcast networks whenever they get a chance, many
%  habitats have a sophisticated darkcast infrastructure
%  that makes use of decoys, temporary communications
%  lines, relays, and regular transmitter relocation—not
%  to mention judicious bribing and blackmailing.
% MESH ABUSES
% As with all things, the mesh has its darker side. At
% the basic level, this amounts to flamewar-starting
% trolls, stalkers, or griefers whose intent is to mess
% with others for a laugh. At the more organized level,
% it expands to illicit or criminal enterprises that utilize
% the mesh, such as selling black/snuff/porn XPs, ille-
% gal software, pirated media, or even egos. The most
% infamous threats—thanks both to the Fall and to
% the continuous sensationalism applied by media and
% stern authorities—are, of course, malware and hack-
% ers. Given the capabilities of modern hackers and the
% vulnerability of many habitats—where damage to life
% support systems could kill thousands—the threat may
% not be over-exaggerated.

% HACKERS
% Whether individuals who are genuinely interested
% in exploring new technologies and seeking ways to
% break them in order to make them better, hacktiv-
% ists who utilize the mesh in order to undermine the
% power of authorities, or “black hats” who seek to
% circumvent network security for malicious or crimi-
% nal intent, hackers are a permanent fixture of the
% mesh. Unauthorized network break-ins, infiltration
% of VPNs, muse subversion, cyberbrain hijacking, data
% theft, cyber-extortion, identity fraud, denial of service
% attacks, electronic warfare, spime hijacking, entoptic
% vandalism—these are all common occurrences on the
% mesh. Thanks to smart and adaptive exploit programs
% and assisting muses, even a moderately skilled hacker
% can be a threat.

% In order to counter hacking attempts, most people,
% devices, and networks are protected by a mix of
% access control routines, automated software intru-
% sion prevention systems, encryption, and layered
% firewalls, typically overseen by the user’s muse who
% plays the role of active defender. Extremely sensitive

% %%% txt/246.txt
% systems—such as space traffic control, life support,
% power systems, and hypercorporate research facili-
% ties—are usually limited to isolated, tightly-controlled,
% heavily-monitored, hard-wired networks to minimize
% the risk of intrusion from snoopers and saboteurs.
% various countermeasures may be applied against
% such intruders, ranging from locking them out of the
% system to tracking them back and counterhacking.

% MALWARE
% The number of worms, virii, and other malware pro-
% grams that ripped through computer systems during
% the Fall was staggering. Many of these were part of
% the netwar systems prepared by old Earth nation-states
% and corporations and unleashed on their enemies.
% Others were products of the TITANs, subversive pro-
% grams that even the best defenses had trouble stopping.
% Even 10 years later, many of these are still reappearing,
% brought back to life by the accessing of some long-
% forgotten data cache or the accidental infection of a
% scavenger mucking through old ruins. New ones pop
% every day, of course, many of them programmed by
% criminal hacker outfits, while others that enter circu-
% lation are modifications and variations of suspected
% TITAN designs, perhaps implying that certain parties
% are intentionally tinkering with this code and releasing
% it into the wild. Rumors and whispers circulate that
% some of these TITAN worms are even more potent and
% frightening than previously hinted at, with stunning
% adaptive capabilities and intelligence. These rumors
% are steadfastly denied by authority figures and security
% experts ... who then quietly turn around and do their
% best to ensure that their own networks remain safe.



% AI S AND INFOLIFE
% Self-aware helper programs were originally designed
% and realized to augment transhuman cognitive abili-
% ties. These specialized-focus AIs were then developed
% into the more complete, independent digital conscious-
% nesses known as AGIs. The further evolution of these
% digital life forms into seed AIs unfortunately led to the
% emergence of the TITANs and then the Fall. This cre-
% ated a rift in transhuman society as fear and prejudice
% turned popular opinion against unrestricted AGIs, an
% attitude of mistrust that still lingers to this day.

% AI S
% The term AI is used to refer to narrow, limited-focus
% AIs. These digital minds are expert programs with pro-
% cessing capabilities equal to or even exceeding that of
% a transhuman mind. Though they have a personality
% matrix with individual identities and character, and
% though they are (usually) conscious and self-aware,
% their overall complexity and capabilities are limited.
% The programmed skills and abilities of AIs are typi-
% cally very specific in scope and aligned towards a par-
% ticular function, such as piloting a vehicle, facilitating
% mesh searches, or coordinating the functions of some
% habitat sub-system. Some AIs, in fact, can only barely
% be considered sapient, and their emotional program-
% ming is usually narrow or non-existent.

% AIs have a number of built-in safety features and
% programmed limitations. They must serve and obey the
% instructions of authorized users within their normal
% functioning parameters and (in the inner system at
% least) must also obey the law. They lack self-interest
% and self-initiative, though they have limited empathy
% and may be programmed to anticipate the needs and
% desires of users and pre-emptively take action on
% their behalf. Perhaps most importantly, however, is
% that their psychological programming is specifically
% based on universal human modes of thought and an
% understanding and support of transhuman goals
% and interests. This is part of an initiative to engineer
% so-called “friendly AIs,” who are programmed with
% sympathy towards transhumanity and all life and seek
% out their best interests.

% In most societies, basic AIs are considered “things”
% or property rather than people and are accorded no
% special rights.

% MUSES
% Muses are a specific type of AI designed to function
% as a personal aide and companion. Most people in
% Eclipse Phase have grown up with a muse at their
% virtual side. Muses tend to have a bit more personality
% and psychological programming than standard AIs and
% over time they build up an extensive database of their
% user’s preferences, likes and dislikes, and personality
% quirks so that they may more effectively be of service
% and anticipate needs. Muses generally have names
% and reside within the character’s mesh inserts or ecto,
% where they can manage the character’s personal area
% network, communications, data queries, and so on.

% AGIS
% AGIs are complete and fully operational digital con-
% sciousnesses, self-aware and capable of intelligent
% action at the same level as any transhuman. Most have
% full autonomy and the capacity for self-improvement
% by a processing similar to learning—a slow optimi-
% zation and expansion of their code that features
% programmed limitations to prevent it from achiev-
% ing the self-upgrading capabilities of seed AIs. They
% have more fully-rounded personalities and emotional/
% empathic abilities than standard AIs, due in part to
% a development process where they are literally raised
% within a VR simulation analogous to the rearing of
% transhuman children, and so are more fully socialized.
% As a result, they have a fairly human outlook, though
% some deviation is to be expected, and sometimes is
% apparent in great degrees. Despite this attempt to hu-
% manize AGIs, they do not have the same evolutionary
% and biological origins that transhumans have, and so
% their social responses, behavior, and goals are some-
% times off-mark or decidedly different.

% AGIs bear the social stigma of their non-biological
% origin and are often met with bias and mistrust. Some
% habitats have even outlawed AGIs or subject them to

% strict restrictions, forcing such infolife to hide their

% true natures or illegally darkcast to enter habitats or

% stations. AGI mind programming emulates transhu-

% man brain patterns sufficiently well that they can be

% sleeved into biomorphs if they choose.


% SEED AI

% Due to the capability for unlimited self-upgrading,

% seed AIs have the capacity to grow into god-like

% digital entities far beyond the level of transhumans

% or AGIs. They require massive processing power and

% are always increasing in complexity due to a continual

% metamorphosis of their code. Seed AIs are too com-

% plex to be downloaded into a physical morph, even

% a synthetic one. Even their forks require impressive

% processing environments, so doing so is rare. In fact,

% most seed AIs require the capacities of hard-wired

% networks to survive.

%  The only seed AIs known to the public are the

% infamous TITANs who are widely regarded as being

% responsible for the Fall. In truth, the TITANs were

% not the first seed AIs and will probably not be the last.

% There are no publicly known TITANs (or other seed

% AIs) currently residing in the solar system, despite

% circulating rumors of damaged TITANs who were left

% behind on Earth, speculated TITAN activity under the

% clouds of Venus, or whispers of new seed AIs hidden

% away in secret networks on the edges of the system.


% TRANSHUMAN INFOMORPHS

% For thousands of infugees, embodying a digital form

% is their only choice. Some of these are locked away

% in mesh-separated virtual holding areas or even inac-

% tive storage, locked up by habitats who didn’t have

% NON-STANDARD AIS

% AND AGIS

% Not all AIs and AGIs were programmed and de

% signed to adhere to human modes of thought

% and interests. Such creations are illegal in some

% jurisdictions, as they are considered a potential

% threat. Several hypercorps and other groups have

% initiated research into this field, however, with

% varying results. In some cases these digital minds

% are so different from human mindsets that com

% munication is is impossible. In others, enough

% crossover exists to allow limited communication

% but such entities are invariably quite strange.


%  Rumors persist that some AIs began their

% life as transhuman backups or forks, who were

% then heavily edited and pruned down to AI

% level intelligences.                            ■



% enough resources to handle them. Others are impris-
% oned inside simulspaces, killing time in whatever way
% they choose until an opportunity to resleeve comes
% their way. Quite a few are free to roam the mesh, in-
% teracting with physically-sleeved transhumans, keep-
% ing up with current events, and sometimes even form-
% ing activist political blocs to campaign for infomorph
% rights or interests. Still others find or are forced into
% virtual careers, slaving away in the digital sweatshops
% of hypercorps or criminal syndicates. A few find com-
% panions who are willing to bring them along in their
% ghostrider module and become an integral part of
% their lives, much like a muse.

% Some transhumans willingly choose the infomorph
% lifestyle, either for hedonism (custom simulspace and
% VR games until the end of time), escapism (loss of a
% loved ones leads them to write off physical concerns
% for awhile), freedom (go anywhere the mesh takes
% you—some have even beamed copies of themselves to
% far distant solar systems, hoping someone or something
% will receive their signal when they arrive), experimen-
% tation (forking and merging, running simulations, and
% weirder things), or because it is ensured immortality.



% EVERYDAY MESH MECHANICS
% Everyone (and everything) is meshed in Eclipse Phase.
% The following rules and concerns apply to standard
% mesh use. Note that various mesh-related terms are
% explained, along with other Eclipse Phase concepts,
% under Terminology, p. 25.

% MESH INTERFACE
% Characters have a choice of which interface to use, the
% entoptic interface of basic mesh inserts or the haptic
% interface of an ecto.

% The basic mesh inserts used by most users allows
% them to interact with AR, VR, XP, and the mesh at the

% %%% txt/248.txt
% speed of thought. This is the default method of mesh
% use and suffers no modifiers. They are, however, more
% prone to visual and operative impairments (virtual il-
% lusions, denial-of-service effects) when hacked.

% Characters who use the haptic interface of an ecto,
% however, suffer a slight delay on their mesh activities
% due to manual toggling, physical controls, and physi-
% cal interaction with virtual controls. In game terms,
% the use of haptics imposes a –10 skill modifier to
% all mesh tests where timing is rushed (particularly
% combat and or any sort of mesh use under pressure).
% Additionally, increase the timeframe for mesh-based
% Task Actions by +25% when interfacing via haptics.
% On the positive side, ectos can be easily removed and
% discarded if compromised—for this reason, many
% hackers and security-conscious users use an ecto in
% addition to their mesh inserts, routing all high-risk
% traffic through the ecto as an extra line of defense.

% MESH ID
% Every mesh user (and, in fact, every device) has a
% unique code called their mesh ID. This ID distin-
% guishes them from all other users and devices, and is
% the mechanism by which others can find them online,
% like a combination phone number, email address, and
% screen name. Mesh IDs are used in almost all online in-
% teractions, which are often logged, meaning that your
% activities online leave a datatrail that can be tracked
% (p. 251). Fortunately for Firewall sentinels and others
% who value their privacy, their are ways around this
% (see Privacy and Anonymity, p. 252). AIs, AGIs, and
% infomorphs also each have their own unique mesh ID.

% ACCOUNTS AND ACCESS PRIVILEGES
% Devices, networks (such as PANs, VPNs, and hard-
% wired networks), and services require that every user
% that accesses them does so with an account. The
% account serves to identify that particular user, is
% linked to their mesh ID, and determines what access
% privileges they have on that system. There are four
% types of accounts: public, user, security, and admin.

% PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
% Public accounts are used for systems that allow
% access (or access to parts of their system) to anyone





% ELITE EXPLOITS

% The mesh gear quality rules allow for players

% and gamemasters to make a distinction between

% software tools, separating the open-source,

% stock-repertoire exploit tools of amateur hackers

% from cutting-edge military-grade penetration

% wares. While many characters will simply buy or

% otherwise acquire such programs, a hacker with

% the do-it-yourself ethic is likely going to want

% to design their own personalized applications,

% based on their playbook of closely-guarded in-

% trusion/counterintrusion methods.


% To reflect the efforts a hacker character makes

% by designing, coding, and modifying their own

% customized personal arsenals, they may make a

% Task Action Programming Test with timeframe

% of 2 weeks. If they succeed, they upgrade one

% of their software tools by one level of quality

% (i.e., from +0 to +10). Multiple Programming

% Tests can be made to enhance a program, but for

% each level add the target modifier as a negative

% modifier to the test (so upgrading a +0 suite to

% +10 is a –10 modifier on the Programming Test).


% Similarly, at the gamemaster’s discretion, soft-

% ware tools—particularly exploits—may degrade

% in quality over time, reflecting that they have

% become outdated. As a general rule, such pro-

% grams should degrade in quality about once

% every 3 months.                                 ■

% %%% txt/249.txt
% on the mesh. Public accounts do not require any sort
% of authentication or login process, the user’s mesh ID
% is enough. These accounts are used to provide access
% to any sort of data that is considered public: mesh
% sites, forums, public archives, open databases, social
% network profiles, etc. Public accounts usually have
% the ability to read and download data, and some-
% times to write data (forum comments, for example),
% but little else.

% USER ACCOUNTS
% User accounts are the most common accounts. User
% accounts require some form of authentication (p. 253)
% to access the device, network, or service. Each user ac-
% count has specific access privileges allotted to it, which
% are tasks the user is allowed to perform on that system.
% For example, most users are allowed to upload and
% download data, change basic content, and use the
% standard features of the system in question. They are
% not, however, usually allowed to alter security features,
% add new accounts, or do anything that might impact
% the security or functioning of the system. As some sys-
% tems are more restrictive than others, the gamemaster
% decides what privileges each user account provides.

% SECURITY ACCOUNTS
% Security accounts are intended for users that need
% greater rights and privileges than standard users, but
% who don’t need control over the entire system, such
% as security hackers and muses. Security access rights
% usually allow for reading logs, commanding security
% features, adding/deleting accounts, altering the data of
% other users, and so on.

% ADMIN ACCOUNTS
% Admin accounts provide complete control over the
% system. Characters with admin rights can do every-
% thing security accounts can, plus they can shut down/
% reboot the system, alter access rights of other users,
% view and edit all log files and statistics, and stop or
% start any software available on the system.

% of computers and software, where new innovations
% are made on a daily basis. Keeping up-to-date with
% the last specs isn’t too difficult, but on occasion the

% installation with next-generation defenses. To reflect

% this, mesh tests can be modified according to the state

% of the hardware or software being used, as noted on

% the Mesh Gear Modifiers table

% .

% COMPUTER CAPABILITIES

% Computerized electronics can be broken down into

% three simple categories: peripherals, personal comput-

% ers, and servers. In game terms, all are collectively

% referred to as devices.


% PERIPHERALS

% Peripherals are micro-computerized devices that don’t

% need the full processing power and storage capacity of

% a personal computer, but benefit from online network-

% ing and other computerized functions. Peripherals may

% run software, but the gamemaster may decide that too

% many programs (10+) will degrade the system’s perfor-

% mance. AIs and infomorphs are incapable of running

% on peripherals, though they may access them. Peripher-

% als only have public and user accounts (users accounts

% include security and admin functions; see p. 247).


% Common peripherals include: spimes, appliances, most

% cybernetic implants, individual sensors, and weapons.


% PERSONAL COMPUTERS

% Personal computers account for a wide range of com-

% puter types, but essentially account for anything that

% has the capabilities evolved from generations and gen-

% erations of personal computers to meet an everyday

% user’s needs. Most personal computers are portable

% and tailored for use by multiple users at a time. Per-

% sonal computers may run one AI or infomorph at a

% time. They may not run simulspace programs.


% Common personal computers include: mesh inserts,

% ectos, and vehicles.


% SERVERS

% Servers have much greater processing power and

% data management capabilities than personal comput-

% ers. They are capable of handling hundreds of users,

% multiple AIs and infomorphs, and they may run

% %%% txt/250.txt
% simulspace programs. Though few are portable, some
% of them come close.

% SOFTWARE
% A wide manner of software is available for mesh users,
% from firewalls and AIs to hacking and encryption tools
% to tacnets and skillsofts. These programs are listed on
% p. 331 of the Gear chapter. Like other gear, software
% may enable a character to perform a task they could
% not otherwise. The quality of the software may also be
% a factor, applying a modifier as appropriate (see Mesh
% Gear Quality, p. 247).

% Some software is equipped with digital restrictions
% to prevent it from being copied and shared with others.
% These restrictions may be defeated, but it is a time-con-
% suming task, requiring a Task Action Programming Test
% with a timeframe of 2 months. Thanks to the efforts
% of the open source movement and numerous individual
% software pirates, however, quite a bit of software is
% available free or online. The availability of pirated soft-
% ware or freeware will depend on the local habitat and
% legalities. Finding it may be a matter of a simple search,
% or it may require some use of reputation to find some-
% one who has it. Usually there is at least one local crime
% syndicate that is willing to help you out—for a price.

% SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY
% In most instances, software compatibility is not going
% to be an issue for characters. Gamemasters who like
% it as a plot device, however, can introduce compat-
% ibility problems in certain cases, whether this is done
% to increase drama, slow the characters down, or create
% obstacles that they must overcome. Such incompat-
% ibilities are more likely to arise when dealing with
% outdated systems or devices, or at least ones that are
% unlikely to have the latest patches and software up-
% dates. Incompatibilities can also be used as a drawback
% to acquiring software from untrustworthy sources.

% Conflicting software issues are going to have one of
% two effects. Either the software will simply not work
% with certain devices, or it will inflict a –10 to –30
% modifier due to instabilities and glitches. If the game-
% master allows it, a character may reduce this penalty
% by patching up the software, requiring a successful
% Programming Task Action (1 day). For every 10 points
% of MoS, reduce the incompatibility modifier by 10.

% TRAFFIC FILTERS AND MIST
% Mesh networks and AR are overrun with yottabytes of
% information. Though mesh inserts and ectos can deal
% with a lot of data traffic in terms of bandwidth and
% processing power, using filters to weed out unwanted
% traffic is quite simply a necessity. This is especially true
% of AR, where unwanted entoptics can clutter your
% vision and distract you. Nevertheless, entoptic spam of
% many flavors—advertisements, political screeds, porn,
% scams—do their best to bypass these filters, and in
% many areas the amount of unfiltered entoptics can be
% overwhelming—a phenomenon colloquially referred
% to as “mist.”

% At the gamemaster’s discretion, mist can interfere
% with a user’s sensory perceptions. This modifier can
% range from –10 to –30, and in some cases might be
% so distracting as to affect all of a character’s actions.
% To lift the data fog, a character or muse must adjust
% their filter settings by succeeding in an Interfacing Test
% modified by the mist modifier. Alternately, the charac-
% ter can completely disable AR input, but this is likely
% to impede them in other ways.

% SLAVING DEVICES

% For ease of use, as well as for privacy and security
% purposes, one or more devices may be slaved to each
% other. One device (usually the character’s mesh inserts
% or ecto) takes the role of master, while the other
% device(s) takes the role of slave. All traffic to and
% from slaved devices is routed through the master. This
% allows a slaved device to rely on the master’s security
% features and active monitoring. Anyone that wants to
% connect to or hacked into a slaved device is rerouted
% to the master for authentication and security scrutiny.
% Slaved devices automatically accept commands from
% their master device. This means that a hacker who
% penetrates a master system can legitimately access
% and issue commands to a slaved device, assuming their
% access privileges allow for it.

% PANs are typically formed by slaving all of a char-
% acter’s devices to their ecto or mesh inserts. Similarly,
% individual components of a security system (doors,
% sensors, etc.) are usually slaved to a central security
% node that serves as a chokepoint for anyone hoping
% to hack the system. The same is often true for other
% networks and facilities.

% ISSUING COMMANDS
% Characters may issue commands to any slaved device
% or teleoperated bot (see Shell Remote Control, p. 196)
% with a Quick Action. Each command counts separately,
% unless the character is issuing the same command to
% multiple devices/drones.

% DISTANCE LAG
% Anytime you extend your communications over great
% distances, you run into the risk of time lags. Most
% communications are restricted to “local” for this
% reason, which generally means your local habitat
% and any others within 50,000 kilometers. On plan-
% etary bodies like Mars, Venus, Luna, or Titan, “local”
% encompasses all of the habitats and linked mesh net-
% works on that planetary body.

% If a character is searching the mesh beyond their
% local area, the most efficient way is to transmit a search
% AI (usually a copy of your muse) or a fork to the non-
% local area, which will then run its search and return
% completed results. This process does, however, add to
% the time of transmission to the timeframe (i.e., search-
% ing the mesh of a station 10 light-minutes away adds
% 20 minutes to the search as the search is transmitted
% over and the results are transmitted back). Since long-
% distance communications are sometimes interfered with

% %%% txt/251.txt
% or bumped for higher-priority items, the gamemaster
% can increase this time at their discretion. If the research
% involves correlation and fine-tuning the search param-
% eters based on data accumulated from different locals,
% the timeframe may be exponentially increased due to
% the need for back-and-forth interaction.

% If the character is simply communicating with or
% accessing non-local networks, an appropriate time lag
% must be introduced between communications and ac-
% tions. The effects of this lag are largely up to the game-
% master, as fitting current distances and other factors.

% ACCESSING MULTIPLE DEVICES
% Meshed characters may connect to and interact with
% numerous devices, networks, and services simulta-
% neously. There is no penalty for doing this, but the
% character may only focus on one system at a time. In
% other words, you may only interact with one system
% at a time, though you may also switch between them
% freely, even within the same Action Phase. You could,
% for example, spend several Quick Actions to send a
% message with your ecto, tell your spime oven at home
% to start cooking dinner, and look up a friend’s updated
% profile on a social network. You may not, however,
% hack into two separate systems simultaneously.

% Note that you may send the same command to
% multiple slaved devices or teleoperated drones with
% the same Quick Action, as noted above.



% ONLINE RESEARCH
% The Research skill (p. 184) represents a character’s
% ability to track down information in the mesh. Such
% information includes any type of digitized data: text,
% pictures, vids, XP, sensor feeds, raw data, software, etc.
% This data is culled from all manner of sources: blogs,
% archives, databases, directories, social networks, rep
% networks, online services, forums, chat rooms, torrent
% caches, and regular mesh sites of all kinds. Research
% is conducted using various public and private search
% engines, both general and specialized, as well as data
% indices and search AIs.

% Research has other uses as well. Hackers use it
% when looking for specific information on a network or
% device on which they have intruded. Likewise, since
% everyone inevitably uses and interacts with the mesh,
% Research skill is also a way to identify, backtrack, and/
% or gather information on people as long as they have
% not hidden their identity, worked anonymously, or
% covered their identity with a shroud of disinformation.

% SEARCH CHALLENGES
% Due to the sheer amount of data available, find-
% ing what you’re looking for may sometimes seem a
% daunting task. Thankfully, information is fairly well
% organized, thanks to the hard work of “spider” AIs
% that cruise the mesh and constantly update data and
% search indices. Additionally, information on the mesh
% is tagged with semantics, meaning that it’s presented
% with code that allows a machine to understand the
% context of that information as well as a human reader
% would. This helps AIs and search software correlate
% data more efficiently. So finding the data is usually not
% as difficult as analyzing it and understanding it. Find-
% ing specialized or hidden info or correlating data from
% multiple sources is usually the real challenge.

% Perhaps a larger issue is the amount of incorrect data
% and misinformation online. Some data is simply wrong
% (mistakes happen) or outdated, but the nature of the
% mesh means that such things can linger on for years
% and even propagate far and wide as they are circulated
% without fact-checking. Likewise, given the amount of




% SEARCH CAPABILITIES

% Online research in Eclipse Phase is not the same

% as just googling something. Here are five ways in

% which it is vastly improved:


% Pattern Recognition: Biometrics and other forms

% of pattern recognition are efficient and intelligent.

% It is not only possible to run image recognition

% searches (in real-time, via all available spimes

% and sensor feeds), but to search for patterns such

% as gait, sounds, colors, emotive displays, traffic,

% crowd movement, etc. Kinesics and behavioral

% analysis even allow sensor searches for people

% exhibiting certain behavioral patterns, such as sus-

% picious loitering, nervousness, or agitation.


% Metadata: Information and files online come

% with hidden data about their creation, alteration,

% and access. A photo’s metadata, for example,

% will note what gear it was taken on, who took

% it, when, and where, as well as who accessed it

% online, though such metadata may be easily

% scrubbed or anonymized.


% Data Mash-Ups: The combination of abundant

% computing, archived data, and ubiquitous public

% sensors enable intriguing correlations to be

% drawn from data that is mined and collated. In

% the midst of a habitat emergency such as a ter-

% rorist bombing, for example, the ID of everyone

% in the vicinity could be scanned, compared to

% data archives to separate out those who have a

% history of being in the vicinity at that particular

% time, with those remaining checked against

% databases of criminal/suspect history and their

% recorded actions analyzed for unusual behavior.


% Translation: Real-time translation of audio and

% video is available from open source translation bots.


% Forecasting: A significant percentage of what

% people do on any day or in response to certain situ-

% ations conforms to routines, enabling easy behav-

% ioral prediction. Muses take advantage of this to

% anticipate needs and provide whatever is desired

% at the right moment and in the right context. The

% same logic applies to actions by groups of people,

% such as economics and social discourse, making pre-

% dictions markets a big deal in the inner system. ■

% %%% txt/252.txt
% transparency in modern society, some entities actively
% engage in disinformation spreading in order to clut-
% ter the mesh with enough falsehoods that the truth is
% hidden. Two factors help to combat this, the first being
% that data sources themselves have their own reputation
% scores, so that untrustworthy or disreputable sources
% can be identified and ranked lower in search results.
% Second, many archives take advantage of crowdsourc-
% ing—that is, harnessing the collaborative power of
% mesh users (and their muses) everywhere—to verify
% data integrity so that these sites are dynamic and
% self-correcting.

% HANDLING SEARCHES
% Online research is often a crucial element of Eclipse
% Phase scenarios, as characters take to the mesh to
% research backgrounds and uncover clues. The follow-
% ing suggestions present a method of handling research
% that does not rely solely on dice rolls and integrates it
% with the flow of the plot.

% First, common and inconsequential information
% should be immediately available without requiring
% a roll at all. Most characters rely on their muses to
% handle searches for them, passing on the results while
% the character focuses on other things.

% For searches that are more detailed, difficult, or
% central to the plot, a Research Test should be called
% for (made either by the character or their muse).
% This test indicates the process of finding links to
% and/or accumulating all data that may in fact be
% relevant to the search topic. This test should be
% modified as appropriate to the obscurity of the topic,
% ranging from +30 for common and public topics
% to –30 for obscure or unusual intel. This initial
% search has a timeframe of 1 minute. If successful, it
% turns up enough data to give the character a basic
% overview, perhaps with cursory details. The game-
% master should use the MoS to determine the depth
% of the data provided on this initial excursion, with
% an Excellent Success providing some bonus details.
% Similarly, a Severe Failure (MoF 30+) may result in
% the character working with data that is incorrect or
% intentionally misleading.

% The next step is not so much accumulating links
% and data as it is analyzing and understanding the in-
% formation acquired. This requires another Research
% Test, again modified by the obscurity of the topic. If
% the gamemaster allows it, complementary skills (p.
% 173) may apply to this test, providing bonus modi-
% fiers (for example, an understanding of Academics:
% Chemistry would help research the effects of a
% strange drug). Muses may also perform this task,
% though their skills are typically inferior. As above,
% success determines the quality and depth of the
% analysis, with an Excellent Success providing the full
% story and potential related issues and a Severe Fail-
% ure marking completely incorrect assumptions. The
% timeframe for this phase of research largely depends
% on two factors: the amount of data being analyzed
% and the importance to the storyline. Gamemasters

% %%% txt/253.txt
% need to carefully measure out their distribution of
% intel and clues to players. Give them too much too
% soon, and they may spoil the plot. Fail to give them
% enough, and they may get frustrated or pursue dead
% ends. Timing is everything.

% REAL-TIME SEARCHES
% Characters may also set up ongoing mesh scans that will
% alert them if any relevant information comes up new or
% updated, or is somehow changed. This is a task usually
% assigned to muses for continuous oversight. Whenever
% such data arises, the gamemaster secretly makes a Re-
% search Test, modified by the obscurity of the topic. If
% successful, the update is noted. If not, it is missed, though
% the gamemaster may allow another test if and when the
% topic reaches a wider range of circulation or interest.

% HIDDEN DATA
% It is important to remember that not everything can
% be found online. Some data may only be acquired (or
% may be more easily gotten) by asking the right people
% (see Networking, p. 286). Information that is consid-
% ered private, secret, or proprietary will likely be stored
% away behind VPN firewalls, in off-mesh hardwired
% networks, or in private and commercial archives. This
% would require the character to gain access to such
% networks in order to get the data they need (assuming
% they even know where to look).

% It’s worth noting that some entities send out AIs
% into the mesh with the intent of finding and erasing
% data they’d rather hide, even if this requires hacking
% into systems to alter such information.



% SCANNING, TRACKING,
% AND MONITORING
% Most users leave traces of their physical and digital
% presence all throughout the mesh. Accounts they access,
% devices with which they interact, services they use, ent-
% optics they perceive—all of these keep logs of the event,
% and some of these records are public. Simply passing
% nearby some devices is enough to leave a trail, as near-
% field radio interactions are often logged. This electronic
% datatrail can be used to track a user, both to ascertain
% their physical location or to note their online activities.

% WIRELESS SCANNING
% To interface with a wireless device or network, whether
% to establish a connection or for other purposes, the
% target device/network must be located first. To locate
% an active node, it’s wireless radio transmissions must be
% detected. Most wireless devices automatically scan for
% other devices in range (see Radio and Sensor Ranges, p.
% 299) as a matter of course, so no test is required. This
% means that it’s trivial for any character to pull up a
% list of the wireless devices and networks around them,
% along with associated mesh IDs. Likewise, a muse or
% device can be instructed to alert the user when a new
% signal (or a specific user) comes into range.

% Detecting stealth signals (p. 252), however, is a bit
% more challenging. To detect a stealthed signal, the scan-
% ning party must actively search for such signals, taking
% a Complex Action and making an Interfacing Test with
% a –30 modifier. If successful, they detect the hidden emis-
% sions. If the character aiming for stealth engages in active
% countermeasures, also requiring a Complex Action, then
% an Opposed Interfacing Test is called for (with the –30
% modifier still applying to the scanning party).

% For covert devices that are only transmitting in
% short bursts, wireless detection is only possible during
% the short period the burst transmission is being made.

% PHYSICAL TRACKING
% Many users willingly allow themselves to be physically
% tracked via the mesh. To them, this is a useful feature—
% it allows their friends to find them, their loved ones to
% know where they are, and for authorities to come to
% their aid in the event of some emergency. Finding their
% location is simply a matter of looking them up in the
% local directory, no test required (assuming you know
% who they are). Mesh positioning is accurate to within
% 5 meters. Once located, the position of the target can
% be monitored as they move as long as they maintain
% an active wireless connection to the mesh.

% TRACKING BY MESH ID
% An unknown user’s physical location can also be
% tracked via their online mesh activity—or more spe-
% cifically, by their mesh ID (p. 246). Network security
% will often trace intruders this way and then dispatch
% security squads to bring them in. To track an unknown
% user by their mesh ID alone requires a Research Test.
% If successful, they have been tracked to their current
% physical location (if still online) or last point of in-
% teraction with the mesh. If the character is in privacy
% mode (p. 252), a –30 modifier applies.

% TRACKING BY BIOMETRICS
% Given the existence of so many spimes and public
% cameras and sensors, people may also be tracked by
% their facial profile alone using facial recognition soft-
% ware. This software scans accessible video feeds and
% attempts to match it to a photo of the target. Given
% the sheer volume of cameras, however, and the typical
% range of false-positives and false-negatives, finding
% the target often boils down to luck. Priority can be
% given to cameras monitoring major thoroughfares, to
% narrow the search, but this risks missing the target if
% they avoid heavy traffic areas. The success of searches
% of this nature is best left to gamemaster fiat, but a
% Research Test can also be called for, modified ap-
% propriately by the range of the area being watched,
% whenever there is a chance the target may be spotted.

% Other biometric signatures may also be used for
% tracking this way, though these are usually less avail-
% able than cameras: thermal signatures (requires infra-
% red cameras), walking gait, scent (requires olfactory
% sensors), DNA (requires DNA scanners), etc. Each
% biometric scan requires a separate type of software.

% %%% txt/254.txt
% DIGITAL ACTIVITY TRACKING
% Tracking someone’s online activities (meshbrowsing,
% entoptic interactions, use of services, messaging, etc.)
% is slightly more difficult, depending on what exactly
% you’re after. Gathering information on a user’s public
% mesh activities—social network profiles, public
% forums posts, public lifelogging, etc.—is handled just
% like standard online research (p. 249).

% TRACKING BY MESH ID
% A more investigate search can attempt to use the
% target’s mesh ID (p. 246), using it as a sort of digital
% fingerprint to look up where else they’ve been online.
% This primarily involves checking access/transaction
% logs, which are not always publicly accessible. This
% sort of search requires a Research Test, handled as a
% Task Action with a timeframe of 1 hour.

% SNIFFING
% Wireless radio traffic is broadcast through the air (or
% space), meaning that it can be intercepted by other wire-
% less devices. “Sniffing” involves the capture and analysis
% of data traffic flowing through the wireless mesh.

% To eavesdrop on wireless communications, you need
% a sniffer program (p. 331) and you must be within
% radio range (p. 299) of the target (alternately, you can
% access a device that is within radio range of the target,
% and sniff from that location). To capture the informa-
% tion you must succeed in an Infosec Test. If successful,
% you capture data traffic from any targeted devices in
% range. Note that sniffing does not work on encrypted
% traffic (including VPNs and anything else using public
% key cryptography) as the results are gibberish. Quan-
% tum encrypted communications cannot be sniffed.

% Once you have the data, finding the information
% you’re looking for can be a challenge. Handle this as
% a standard Research Test (p. 245).

% REMOTE SNIFFING VIA MESH ID
% Finally, a mesh ID may also be actively monitored
% to see what mesh activity it engages in. This requires
% special sniffer software (p. 331) and a Research Test.
% If successful, the monitoring will provide information
% on that user’s public mesh activities (how much is
% determined by the gamemaster and the MoS), such
% as which sites they access, who they message, etc. It
% will not, however, uncover anything that is encrypted
% (unless the encryption is broken) or anything that
% takes place on a VPN (unless the VPN is hacked first),
% though it will show that encrypted communications
% and/or VPN use are taking place.



% PRIVACY AND ANONYMIZATION
% Given how easily mesh activities are monitored, many
% users pursue privacy and anonymization options.

% PRIVACY MODE
% Characters who go into privacy mode hide their online
% presence and activities from others to a limited degree.
% The exact settings are adjustable, but typically involve
% masking their social profiles and presence to other
% users in the immediate vicinity, like having an unlisted
% phone number. Privacy mode can also be used to limit
% the use of mesh IDs and other data in access and
% transaction logs, applying a –30 modifier to attempts
% to research or track them by their online activity.

% STEALTHED SIGNALS
% Another tactic that can be taken for privacy is to
% stealth the wireless radio signals you emit. This
% method uses a combination of spread-spectrum signals,
% frequency hopping, and modulation to make your
% radio transmissions harder to detect with scanning (p.
% 251). Stealthing your signals is either a passive activity
% (Automatic Action, –30 modifier on Interface Tests to
% locate the signal) or an active one (Complex Action,
% requires an Opposed Test to locate).

% ANONYMIZATION
% Anonymization takes the issue of privacy a bit further.
% The user does not just hide their mesh ID, but they
% actively use false mesh IDs and take other measures to
% reroute and obfuscate their datatrail. Anonymization
% is a necessity both for clandestine operatives and those
% engaging in illicit mesh activities.

% FALSE MESH IDS
% The easiest method of making mesh activities anony-
% mous is to set your muse to supply false mesh IDs in
% online transactions. Though illegal in many jurisdic-
% tions, this is an easy task for any character or muse to
% do. Multiple false IDs are used, making it extremely dif-
% ficult for anyone to tie all of the user’s activities together.

% This method makes it extremely difficult for anyone
% to track the user’s online actions. Someone attempting
% to track the character via these false mesh IDs must
% beat them in an Opposed Test, pitting their Research
% skill with a –30 modifier against the character’s (or
% more likely, their muse’s) Infosec skill. This is a Task
% Action with a base timeframe of 1 hour, adjusted
% higher according to the amount of activity they hope
% to track. If successful, the tracker manages to dig
% together enough correlating evidence and records of
% false IDs to get a picture of the character’s activities
% (how thorough this picture is depends on their MoS).
% If the fail, the anonymous character has effectively
% camouflaged themselves in the mesh.

% Actively monitoring a character who is fluctuating
% their mesh ID with a sniffer program, or physically
% tracking them via the mesh, is next to impossible, as
% the continual shifting of IDs and intentional decoys
% make it too difficult to keep up.

% ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT SERVICES
% A number of people—not just criminals, hackers, and
% secret agents—have an interest in keeping some of
% their affairs anonymous. To meet this demand, various
% online service vendors offer anonymous accounts for
% messaging and credit transfers. Some of these vendors

% %%% txt/255.txt
% are legit business (in places where it is legal), some
% are criminals operating illegally, others are hacktivists
% promoting the privacy meme, and still others are hy-
% percorps or other organizations offering such services
% internally to their own staff/membership.

% The interaction between the vendor and user is
% encrypted and anonymous, with no logs kept, so even
% if the vendor’s servers are hacked, an intruder will
% not find any leads. While some anonymous accounts
% are established for regular use, the truly paranoid use
% (multiple) one-time accounts for maximum security.
% One-time accounts are used for a single message (in-
% coming or outgoing) or credit transaction, and then
% are securely erased.

% Tracking an anonymous account is a practical
% impossibility, and something that only an extremely
% resourceful organization employing a systematic and
% expensive effort could attempt.

% DISPOSABLE ECTOS
% Another option for those seeking privacy and se-
% curity is to simply use disposable ectos. Using this
% method, all activity is routed through a specific ecto
% (using its mesh ID), the ecto is used for a limited
% period (until it gets hot), and then it is simply dis-
% carded or destroyed.



% MESH SECURITY
% Given the lessons of the Fall and the very real risk still
% posed by hackers, virii, and similar threats, network
% security is taken extremely seriously in Eclipse Phase.
% Four methods are typically used: authentication, fire-
% walls, active monitoring, and encryption.

% AUTHENTICATION
% Most devices, networks (PANs, VPNs, etc.), and ser-
% vices require some kind of authentication (a process
% by which a system determines whether the claimed
% identity of a user is genuine) before they grant an ac-
% count and access privileges (p. 246) to a user. There
% are several different ways for a system to authenticate
% a user. Some are more reliable and secure than others,
% but for the most part, the more secure the method, the
% higher the operational expenses.

% Account: If you have access to an account on one
% system, this may give you automatic access to related
% systems or subsystems. This is typical of slaved devices
% (p. 248), where access to the master automatically
% grants you access to slaves.

% Mesh ID: Some systems accept mesh IDs as authen-
% tication. This is extremely common with most public
% systems, which merely log the mesh ID of any user
% that wishes access. Other systems will only allow
% access to specific mesh IDs, but these are vulnerable
% to spoofing (p. 255).

% Passcode: This is a simple string of alphanumeric
% characters or logographic symbols, submitted in an
% encrypted format. Anyone with the passcode can
% access the account.

% Biometric Scan: This calls for a scan of one or more
% of the user’s biometric signatures (fingerprint, palm
% print, retinal scan, DNA sample, etc.). Popular before
% the Fall, such systems have fallen out of use as they
% are impractical with synthmorphs or users that fre-
% quently resleeve.

% Passkey: Passkey systems call for some of encrypted
% code that is either hardwired into a physical device
% (that is either implanted or physically jacked into
% an ecto) or extracted from specialized software. Ad-
% vanced passkeys combine hardwired encryption with
% physical nanotech etching to create a unique key. To
% access such systems, the passkey must either be ac-
% quired or somehow spoofed.

% Ego Scan: This system authenticates the user’s ego
% ID (p. 279).

% Quantum Key: Quantum key systems rely on the un-
% breakable encryption of quantum cryptography (p. 254).

% FIREWALLS
% Firewalls are software programs (sometimes hard-
% wired into a device) that intercept and inspect all traf-
% fic to and from a protected network or device. Traffic
% that meets specified criteria that designates it as safe
% is passed through, whereas all other traffic is blocked.
% In Eclipse Phase, every network and device can be
% assumed to have a firewall by default. Firewalls are
% the main obstacle that an intruder must overcome, as
% discussed under Intrusion Tests, p. 255.

% Like other gear, firewalls come in varying quality
% levels and so may apply modifiers to certain tests.

% ACTIVE MONITORING
% Instead of relying on authentication and firewalls
% alone, secure systems are actively monitored by a se-
% curity hacker or a muse. These digital security guards
% inspect network traffic using a number of software
% tools and applications that flag conspicuous events.
% Active surveillance makes intrusions more difficult,
% since the interloper must beat the monitoring hacker/
% AI in an Opposed Test (see Intrusion, p. 254). Active
% monitoring also includes monitoring any devices
% slaved to the monitored system.

% Characters may actively monitor their own PANs if
% they so choose, though this requires a moderate level
% of attention (count as a Quick Action). It is far more
% common for a muse to actively guard a user’s PAN.

% ENCRYPTION
% Encryption is an exceptionally effective extra layer of
% security. There are two types of encryption commonly
% used in Eclipse Phase: public key cryptosystems and
% quantum cryptography.

% PUBLIC KEY CRYPTO
% In public key cryptosystems, two keys are generated
% by the user, a public key and a secret key. The public
% key is used to encrypt messages to that user, and is
% made freely available. When messages are encrypted
% using that public key, only the secret key—controlled

% %%% txt/256.txt
% by the user—can decrypt them. Public key crypto is
% widely used both for encrypting data traffic between
% two users/networks/devices and for encrypting
% files. Due to the strength of the public key system
% algorithms, such crypto is essentially unbreakable
% without a quantum computer (see Quantum Code-
% breaking, p. 254).

% QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
% Quantum key distribution systems use quantum me-
% chanics to enable secure communications between two
% parties by generating a quantum key. The major advan-
% tage of transmitting information in quantum states is
% that the system itself instantly detects eavesdropping
% attempts as quantum systems are disturbed by any sort
% of external interference. In practical terms, this means
% that quantum encrypted data transfers are unbreakable
% and attempts to intercept automatically fail. Note that
% quantum crypto doesn’t work for basic file encryption,
% its only use is in protecting communication channels.

% While quantum key systems have an advantage over
% public key systems, they are both more expensive and
% less practical. In order to generate a quantum key,
% the two communications devices must be entangled
% together on a quantum level, in the same location,
% and then separated. So quantum key encrypted
% communications channels require some setup effort,
% especially if long distances are involved. Since the
% implementation of quantum cryptographic protocols
% is an extraordinary expense, it is usually only adopted
% for major high-security communications links.

% BREAKING ENCRYPTION
% What this means is that encrypted communications
% lines and files are very safe if using public key systems,
% and that data transfers are absolutely safe if using
% quantum crypto. Gamemasters should take note, how-
% ever: while this may be useful to player characters, it
% may also hinder them. If the characters need to get at
% something that is encrypted, they’re going to need to
% figure out some way to get the secret key’s passcode.
% Common methods include the old standbys of bribery,
% blackmail, threats, and torture. Other options involve
% espionage or social engineering to somehow acquire
% the passcode. Hackers could also find some other
% method to compromise the system and gain inside
% access, bypassing the encryption entirely.

% QUANTUM CODEBREAKING
% As noted above, quantum computers can also be used
% to break public key encryption. This requires an Infosec
% Task Action Test with a +30 modifier and a timeframe
% of 1 week (once started, the quantum computer finishes
% the job on its own; the user does not need to provide
% constant oversight). Gamemasters should feel free to
% modify this timeframe as fits the needs of their game.
% Note that quantum computers cannot break quantum-
% encrypted communications, only encrypted files.



% INTRUSION
% The art of intrusion lies in penetrating a device’s secu-
% rity. The best methods involve infiltrating a system qui-
% etly, without catching a watchdog’s attention, by using
% exploits—code glitches, flawed security protocols—to
% create a path circumventing the target’s defenses. When
% called for, however, a hacker can toss aside pretenses
% and attempt to brute-force their way in.

% PRECONDITIONS
% In order to hack a device, the hacker needs to establish
% a direct connection to the target computer system. If
% the hacker is making a direct wireless connection to
% the target, the target system must be wireless-capable
% and within range (p. 299), and the hacker must know
% the target is there (see Wireless Scanning, p. 251). If
% the system is hard-wired, the hacker must physically
% jack in by using a regular jacking port or somehow
% tapping into a cable that carries the network’s data
% traffic. If the hacker is accessing the target through the

% %%% txt/257.txt
% mesh, the target system must be online and the hacker
% must know it’s mesh ID (p. 246) or otherwise be able
% to track it down (p. 251).

% CIRCUMVENTING AUTHENTICATION
% Rather than hacking in, an intruder can try to sub-
% vert the authentication system used to vet legitimate
% users. The easiest manner of doing this is to somehow
% acquire the passcode, passkey, or whatever authentica-
% tion method the target uses (p. 253). With this in hand,
% no test is necessary to access the system; the hacker
% simply logs in just like a legitimate user and has all of
% the normal access privileges of that user.

% Lacking a passcode, the hacker can try to subvert
% the authentication system in one of two other ways:
% spoofing or forgery.

% SPOOFING AUTHENTICATION
% Using this method, the hacker attempts to disguise
% their signals as coming from the legitimate, authen-
% ticated user, rather than from themself. If successful,
% the system is fooled by this masquerade, accepting the
% hacker’s commands and activity as if they came from
% a legitimate user. Spoofing is more difficult to pull off,
% but is very effective when it works.

% To spoof a legitimate user, the hacker must be using
% both sniffer and spoofing software (p. 331). The
% hacker must then monitor a connection between the
% legitimate user and the target system, and succeed
% in an Infosec Test to sniff the traffic between them
% (p. 252). Apply a –20 modifier if the user has secu-
% rity account privileges, –30 if they have admin rights
% (p. 247). If the connection is encrypted, this will fail
% unless the hacker has the encryption key.

% Armed with this data, the hacker then uses it to
% disguise their signals. This requires an Infosec Test,
% modified by the quality of the system’s firewall and
% the hacker’s spoofing program. If successful, com-
% munications sent by the hacker are treated as coming
% from the legitimate user.

% FORGING AUTHENTICATION
% Biometric and passkey systems used for authentication
% (p. 253) can potentially be forged hackers who are
% able to get a look at the originals. The means and tech-
% niques for doing so differ, and are beyond the scope of
% this book, but successfully forging such systems would
% allow a hacker to log in as the legitimate user.

%  2. Bypass Active Security

%  a. Hacker Wins with Excellent Success, Defender

%  b. Hacker Succeeds, Defender Fails

%  c. Both Succeed

%  d. Defender Succeeds, Hacker Fails


% INTRUSION TESTS


% Hacking into a node is a time-consuming task. The


% target system must be carefully analyzed and probed


% for weaknesses, without alerting its defenses. Depend-


% ing on the type of security in place, more than one test


% may be called for.


%   Hackers require special exploit software (p. 331) to


% take advantage of security holes, but software does


% not a hacker make. What really counts is Infosec skill


% (p. 180), which is the ability to use, modify, and im-


% provise exploits to their full advantage.



% DEFEATING THE FIREWALL


% Lacking a passcode, the hacker must break in the old-


% fashioned way: discreetly scanning the target, look for


% weaknesses, and take advantage of them. In this case


% the hacker takes their exploit software and makes an


% Infosec Test. This is handled as a Task Action with a


% timeframe of 10 minutes. Various modifiers may apply,


% such as the quality of the exploit software, the quality


% of the Firewall, or the alertness of the target system. The


% gamemaster may also modify the timeframe, shortening


% it to reflect systems that are cookie-cutter common with


% known security flaws or raising it as fitting for a top-of-


% the-line system with still-unreleased defenses.


%    By default, a hacker trying to break in this way is


% pursuing standard user access rights (p. 247). If the


% hacker wishes to obtain security or admin privileges on


% the system, apply a –20 or –30 modifier, respectively.


%     If the Infosec Test succeeds, the intruder has invaded


% the system without triggering any alarms. If the system is


% actively monitored (p. 253), they must now avoid detec-


% tion by that watchdog (see below). If there is no active


% monitor, the intruder gains the status of Covert (see In-


% truder Status, p. 256). If the intruder scored an Excellent


% Success, however, their status is Hidden (p. 256).


%     Probing: Players may choose to take the time (p.


% 116) when probing the target for weakness and ex-


% ploits. In fact, this is a common procedure when a


% hacker wants to ensure success.



% BYPASSING ACTIVE SECURITY


% If a system is also actively monitored (p. 253), the


% hacker must avoid detection. Treat this as a Variable


% Opposed Infosec Test between the intruder and the


% monitor. The outcome depends on both rolls:


%    If only the intruder succeeds, the hacker has ac-


% cessed the node without the monitor or the system

% noticing. The hacker has acquired Covert status (p.
% 256). If the hacker scored an Excellent Success, their
% status is Hidden (p. 256).

% If only the monitor succeeds, the hacking attempt
% is spotted and the monitor may immediately lock the
% hacker out of the system before they manage to fully
% break in. The intruder may try again, but the monitor
% will be vigilant for further intrusions.

% If both succeed, the intruder has gained access but
% the monitor is aware that something strange is going
% on. The hacker acquires Spotted status.

% If both fail, continue to make the same test on each
% of the hacker’s Action Phases, until one or both succeed.

% INTRUDER STATUS
% Intruder status is a simple way of measuring an
% invader’s situation when they are intruding upon
% a system. This status has an impact on whether the
% hacker has caught any attention or if they managed
% to remain unobtrusive. Status is first determined when
% the intruder access the system, though it may change
% according to events.

% Note that intruder status is a separate matter from
% account access privileges (p. 246). The latter represents
% what a user can legally do on a system. The former
% indicates how aware the system is of the hacker’s true
% nature as an intruder.

% HIDDEN
% An intruder with Hidden status has managed to silent-
% ly sneak into the system without anyone noticing. The
% system’s security is totally unaware of their presence
% and may not act against them. In this case, the hacker
% is not using an account so much as they are exploit-
% ing a flaw in the system that grants them a nebulous,
% behind-the-scenes sort of presence in the system. The
% hacker effectively has admin access rights, but does
% not show up as an admin-level user in logs or other
% statistics. Hidden characters receive a +30 modifier on
% any efforts to subvert the system.

% COVERT
% An intruder with Covert status has accessed the
% system in a manner that doesn’t attract any unusual
% attention. For all intents and purposes, they appear
% to be a legitimate user with whatever access rights
% they sought. Only extensive checking will turn up any
% abnormalities. The system is aware of them, but does
% not consider them a threat.

% SPOTTED
% Spotted status indicates that the system is aware of an
% anomaly or intrusion but hasn’t zeroed in on the in-
% truder yet. The hacker appears to be a legitimate user
% with whatever access rights they sought, but this will
% not hold up under close scrutiny. The system goes on
% passive alert (inflicting a –10 modifier to the hacker’s
% activities on that system) and may engage the hacker
% with passive countermeasures (p. 257).
% LOCKED
% Locked status means that the intruder—including their
% datatrail—has been pinned down by system security.
% The hacker has access and account privileges, but they
% have been flagged as an interloper. The system is on
% active alert (inflicting a –20 modifier on the hacker’s ac-
% tions) and may launch active countermeasures (p. 257)
% against the intruder.

% CHANGING STATUS
% An intruder’s status is subject to change according to
% their actions and the actions of the system.

% UPGRADING STATUS
% A hacker can attempt to improve their status in order
% to better protect themself. This requires a Complex
% Action and an Infosec Test. If the hacker has Spotted
% status, this is an Opposed Test between monitor and
% intruder. If the hacker wins and scores an Excellent
% Success (MoS of 30+), they have upgraded their status
% by one level (for example, from Covert to Hidden).
% Intruders with Locked status may not upgrade.

% ZEROING IN
% A security hacker or muse that is actively monitoring
% a system can take a Complex Action and attempt to
% hone in on a Spotted intruder. An Opposed Infosec Test
% is made between both parties. If the system’s defender
% wins, the hacker is downgraded to Locked status.

% FAILING TESTS
% Any time an intruder scores a Severe Failure (MoF
% 30+) on a test involving manipulating the system, they
% are automatically downgraded one status level (from
% Covert to Spotted, for example). If a critical failure
% is rolled, they immediately give themselves away and
% achieve Locked status.

% BRUTE-FORCE HACKING
% Sometimes a character simply doesn’t have time to do
% the job right, and they need to hack in now or never.
% In this case the hacker engages the target system im-
% mediately, head on, without taking any time to pre-
% pare an attack. The hacker simply brings all of their
% software exploit tools to bear, throwing them at the
% target and hoping that one works. This is handled as
% an Infosec Test, but as a Task Action with a timeframe
% of 1 minute (20 Action Turns). The hacker receives
% a +30 modifier on this test. Many hackers choose to
% rush the job (see Task Actions, p. 120), in order to cut
% this time even shorter.

% The drawback to brute-force hacking is that it imme-
% diately triggers an alarm. If the system is actively moni-
% tored, the hacker must beat the monitor in an Opposed
% Infosec Test or be immediately locked out as soon as
% they break in. Even if they succeed, the hacker has
% Locked status and is subject to active countermeasures.

% %%% txt/259.txt
% INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES
% If an intruding hacker fails to penetrate a system’s
% defenses (i.e., they are Spotted or Locked, see p. 256),
% then the system goes on alert and activates certain
% defenses. The nature of the applied countermeasures
% depends on the capabilities of the system, the abilities
% of its security defender(s), and the policy of its owner/
% admins. While some nodes will simply seek to kick
% the intruder out and keep them shut out, others will
% actively counterattack, seeking to track the intruder
% and potentially hack the intruder’s own PAN.

% SECURITY ALERTS
% Security alerts come in two flavors: passive and active.

% PASSIVE ALERT
% Passive alerts are triggered when an intruder hits Spot-
% ted status. The system immediately flags a visual or
% acoustic cue to anyone actively monitoring the system
% and possibly the owner or admins. It immediately
% launches one or more passive countermeasures (see
% below). Depending on the system, extra security hack-
% ers or AIs may be brought in to help investigate. If the
% intruder is not encountered again or located within a
% set time period (usually about 10 minutes), the alarm
% is deactivated and the event is logged as an anomaly.
% Depending on the security level of the system, some-
% one may analyze the logs at some point and try to
% ascertain what happened—and prevent it from hap-
% pening again.

% All intruders suffer a –10 modifier for tests involv-
% ing a system that is on passive alert.

% ACTIVE ALERT
% An active alert is triggered when an intruder hits
% Locked status. The system immediately alerts the
% owners, admins, and monitoring security agents.
% Additional security assets (hackers and AIs) may be
% called in. The system also launches active countermea-
% sure against the intruder (see below). Active alerts are
% maintained for as long as the intruder is present, and
% sometimes for a lengthy period afterwards just in case
% the hacker returns.

% PASSIVE COUNTERMEASURES
% Passive countermeasures are launched as a precaution
% whenever an intruder acquires Spotted status.

% LOCATE INTRUDER
% A security hacker or AI monitoring a system may at-
% tempt to track down the source of the passive alert.
% See Zeroing In, p. 256.

% RE-AUTHENTICATE
% When a passive alert is triggered, a firewall can be set
% to re-authenticate all active users, starting with the
% most recent. At the beginning of the next Action Turn,
% everyone on the system must take an action to log
% back in. For intruders, this means making an Infosec
% Test, modified by –10 for the passive alert, to satisfy
% the system that they are a legitimate user.

% REDUCE PRIVILEGES
% As a protective measure, some systems will immedi-
% ately reduce access privileges available to standard
% users, and sometimes security users as well. One
% common tactic is to protect all logs, backing them up
% and making sure no one has rights to delete them.

% ACTIVE COUNTERMEASURES
% Active countermeasures can only be launched if the
% intruder has acquired Locked status.

% COUNTERINTRUSION
% A security hacker or guardian AI can proactively
% defend a system by attacking the intruder’s source. For
% this to occur, the intruder must first be successfully
% traced (p. 251). Once this occurs, the security forces
% can then launch their own intrusion on the hacker’s
% home ecto/mesh inserts and/or PAN.

% LOCKOUT
% A system that has locked onto an intruder may also
% attempt to lock them out. Lockout is an attempt to
% remove the compromised account, sever the connec-
% tion between the two, and dump the hacker from
% the system.

% Lockout must be initiated by someone with secu-
% rity or admin privileges. An Opposed Infosec Test is
% made, with the intruder suffering a –20 modifier for
% being Locked. If the character defending the system
% succeeds, the intruder is immediately ejected from
% the system and the account they used will be placed
% on quarantine or deleted. That account will not be
% usable again until a security audit approves it and
% replaces the authentication. Any attempt to access
% the system from the same mesh ID as the intruder
% automatically fails.

% REBOOT/SHUTDOWN
% Perhaps the most drastic option for dealing with an
% interloper is to simply shut down the system. In this
% case, the system closes all wireless connections (if it
% has any), logs off any users, terminates all processes,
% and shut itself down—thereby locking out the intruder.
% The disadvantage, of course, is that the system must
% interrupt its activities. For example, shutting down
% your mesh inserts or ecto means losing all communica-
% tion with teammates, access to augmented reality, and
% control over slaved/linked devices.

% Initiating a reboot/shutdown is only a Complex
% Action, but the actual process of shutdown takes
% anywhere from 1 Action Turn (personal devices) to 1
% minute (large hardwired networks with multiple users),
% determined by the gamemaster. Rebooting a system
% takes the same amount of time to get started again.

% %%% txt/260.txt
% TRACE
% For high-security systems, a popular countermeasure
% is to track the infiltrator’s physical location via their
% mesh ID (see Physical Tracking, p. 251). In most cases,
% habitat physical security is subsequently alerted and
% forwarded the position to take care of the criminal.

% WIRELESS TERMINATION
% An alternative to shutdown or rebooting is simply to
% sever all wireless connections by shutting down the
% wireless capabilities of the system. The system will
% lose all active connections, but any intruders will be
% dumped. Wireless termination is a Complex Action to
% initiate and completes at the end of that Action Turn.
% Re-starting wireless connectivity takes 1 Action Turn.





% JOINT HACKING/

% SECURING

% Hacking will sometimes involve teams of attack-

% ers and/or teams of defenders. A hacker might

% be backed up by their muse or another team

% member with moderate Infosec skills. Hard

% networks are often defended and monitored

% by teams of highly-skilled security hackers and

% AIs. When intruding in or defending a computer

% system, operators must decide whether to act

% individually or in concert.


% Each approach has its tradeoffs. A team that

% chooses to breach or maintain a system’s security

% as a team effort must allocate one character (usu-

% ally the team member with the highest Infosec

% skill) as the primary actor (see Teamwork, p. 117).

% Each additional character and muse adds a +10

% modifier for each test (up to the maximum +60

% modifier) but cannot spend time on other actions

% than those performed by the team leader. When

% acting in concert, teams may switch team leaders

% at any time, in case group members are special-

% ized for certain tasks.


% Alternately, both intruding and defending

% teams may choose to act individually but for a

% joint goal. Each hacker must make intrusions

% on their own, with individual repercussions for

% detection and counterintrusion, which runs the

% risk of affecting all intruders if any one is Spotted

% or Locked. On the other hand, a team of intrud-

% ers can pursue multiple actions simultaneously in

% a coordinated manner and may temporarily over-

% whelm available security. The same holds true for

% system defenders, who may accomplish more by

% splitting their actions, leaving some to monitor

% while others launch counterintrusion attacks and

% other countermeasures.                              ■

% %%% txt/261.txt
% SUBVERSION
% Once an intruder has successfully invaded a device
% or network, they can pursue whatever tasks they are
% interested in, as fitting that particular system. Depend-
% ing on the type of account the intruder hacked, they
% may or may not have access privileges to do what
% they want to do. If their access rights allow it, the
% activity is handled like that of a legitimate user and
% no test is called for (unless the activity itself calls for
% some kind of test, such as Research). For example, a
% hacker who infiltrates a habitat’s security system with
% a security account can monitor cameras, deactivate
% sensors, review recorded surveillance footage, and so
% on, as any legitimate user with security right would be
% allowed to do.

% Engaging in any sort of activity for which you
% don’t have access rights is more difficult and requires
% hacking the system. This typically requires an Infosec
% Success Test, modified by the difficulty of the action
% as noted on the Subversion Difficulties table. In most
% cases this in not an Opposed Test even if the system is
% actively monitored, unless specifically stated otherwise.
% Failing such tests, however, will result in a change of
% the hacker’s intruder status (see Failing Tests, p. 256).

% Examples for different types of system subversion
% are given in the Subversion Examples sidebar. This
% is not an exhaustive list, however, and gamemasters
% and players are encouraged to improvise game effects
% in case an action has not been explicitly described.

% AUGMENTED REALITY ILLUSIONS
% A hacker who has infiltrated an ecto, mesh inserts, or
% some other device with an AR interface may inject
% different kinds of visual, auditory, tactile, and even
% emotional illusions into the augmented reality of
% the device’s user, depending on the type of interface
% used. How the hacked user will respond to the illu-
% sion depends on a number of factors, such as whether
% they are aware of the intruder (i.e., the hacker has
% Spotted or Locked status), what type of interface they
% are using (entoptic or haptic), and how realistic the
% illusion is.

% The best illusions are, of course, crafted in advance,
% using the best image and sensory manipulation tools
% available. Such illusions are hyper-realistic. Anyone

% suffers a –10 to –30 modifier (gamemaster’s discre-
% tion). An eclectic collection of software programs
% offer a diverse range of AR illusions.

% Hackers may also improvise illusions on the
% fly, usually by patching in sensor data from others
% sources, though this is more difficult and more easily
% spotted (typically adding a +10 to +30 modifier to
% Perception Tests). The advantage is that the hacker
% can modify the illusion in reaction to the user’s ac-
% tions or environmental factors on the fly. AR illusion
% software, however, also offers some template illusions
% that can be modified and controlled in real-time via a
% connected interface.

% Whenever a user is bombarded with AR illusions, the
% gamemaster should make a secret Perception Test to see
% if they spot the deception. Even if they do, however, the
% character may still react to them. Almost anyone will
% duck when they see an object suddenly flying at their
% face, as their body reacts on its own before the brain
% comprehends that it’s an illusion and not a threat.

% Aside from their deceptive value, illusions can be
% used to distract users or otherwise impair their percep-
% tive faculties. For example, dark illusory clouds can
% obscure vision, ear-wrenching high-volume noises can
% make people cringe, and a persistent tickling sensation
% might drive anyone crazy. Such effects can apply a –10
% to –30 modifier to Perception Tests and other actions,
% but the user can also adjust their filters and/or turn
% their AR off if necessary.

% BACKDOORS
% A backdoor is a method of bypassing a system’s normal
% authentication and security features. It enables a hacker
% to sneak into a system by exploiting a flaw (which can
% take the form of an installed program or modification
% to an existing program or hardware device) that was
% integrated into the system previously, either by themself
% or another hacker (who shared the backdoor).

% To install a backdoor, the hacker must successfully
% infiltrate the system and succeed in both a Program-
% ming and an Infosec Test (or an Opposed Infosec Test
% if the system is actively monitored). The Programming
% Test determines how well the backdoor is crafted and
% hidden within system processes, while the Infosec Test
% represents incorporating it into the system without se-
% curity noticing. Modify the Programming Test by –20
% if the hacker wants to have security privileges when
% using the backdoor, –30 for admin.

% Once installed, using a backdoor requires no test to
% access the system—the hacker simply logs on as if they
% were a legitimate user, gaining Covert status. Anyone
% who is aware of a backdoor’s details may use it.

% How long the backdoor lasts depends on many fac-
% tors and is largely up to the gamemaster. Backdoors
% are only likely to be spotted during complete security
% audits, so more paranoid systems are likely to detect
% them earlier. Security audits may also occur when an
% intruder is Spotted but never Locked. Security audits
% are a Task Action with a timeframe of 24 hours. The
% character conducting the audit makes an Infosec
% Test to spot the back door. If the backdoor’s installer
% scored an Excellent Success on their Programming
% Test, this Infosec Test suffers a –30 modifier.

% CRASHING SOFTWARE
% Intruders can attempt to crash software programs
% by killing the processes that run them. This requires a
% Complex Action and an Infosec Test. Note that some
% software is set to immediately respawn, but this can take
% from 1 Action turn to 1 minute, depending on the system.

% Hackers may crash AIs, AGIs, and even infomorphs
% this way, but the process is more difficult. In this case,
% an Opposed Infosec Test is made against the target,
% who is immediately aware they are under attack. Two
% consecutive tests must succeed in order to crash an AI,
% three in order crash an AGI or infomorph. If successful,
% the AI/infomorph immediately reboots, which generally
% takes 3 Action Turns, longer if the gamemaster chooses.

% ELIMINATING INTRUSION TRACES
% Hackers who have avoided being Locked may attempt
% to clean up all traces of their intrusion before they
% exit a system. This involves erasing incriminating data
% in the access and security logs, and otherwise hiding
% any evidence of system tampering. This requires a
% Complex Action and an Infosec Test, or an Opposed
% Infosec Test if the system is actively monitored. If suc-
% cessful, the intruder has wiped anything that might be
% used to track them down later, such as mesh ID, etc.

% HACKING VPNS
% Virtual private networks (VPNs) are more challeng-
% ing to hack than standard devices. Because they exist
% as an encrypted network within the mesh, accessing
% channels of communication within a VPN is all but
% impossible with the encryption key. This means any
% attempt to sniff the VPN traffic is also impossible
% with the key.

% The only way to hack a VPN is to hack into a
% device that is part of the VPN and running the VPN
% software. Once an intruder has access to such a device,
% they can attempt to access the VPN. The account the
% hacker has compromised may have VPN privileges, in
% which case they are in. If not, they must hack access,
% requiring an Infosec Test with a Minor modifier (–10).

% Once access to the VPN is acquired, the hacker may
% treat the VPN like any other network. They may hack
% other devices on the VPN, sniff VPN traffic, track
% other users on the VPN, research data hidden away
% on the VPN, and so on.

% SCRIPTING
% A script is a simple program—a batch of instructions—
% that a hacker can embed in a system to be executed at
% a later pre-scheduled time or upon a certain trigger
% event, even without the hacker being present. When
% activated, the script will undertake a number of system
% operations limited by the abilities of the operating
% system and the access rights the hacker had when
% they implemented the script in the system. Scripts are

% %%% txt/263.txt
% a great way for a hacker to subvert a system without
% necessarily being in danger when they do it.

% Scripts can be programmed on the fly or prepro-
% grammed. When composing the script, the character
% must detail what system operations the set will call
% for, in what order and at what times (or at what trig-
% ger steps). The script cannot contain more steps/tasks
% than the character’s Programming skill ÷ 10 (round
% down). To program a script, the character must suc-
% ceed in a Programming Test with a timeframe deter-
% mined by the gamemaster.

% To load the script, the character must have suc-
% cessfully intruded in the system and must succeed
% in an Infosec Test (or an Opposed Infosec Test if the
% system is actively monitored). If successful, the script
% is loaded into the system and will run as programmed.

% Once the script is activated, it carries out the pre-
% programmed sequence of actions. The programmer’s
% Infosec skill is used for any tests those actions call for.

% Inactivated scripts may be detected in a security
% audit, just like backdoors (p. 260).




%       Sarlo has infiltrated a security system and wants


%       to arrange it so that a particular security sensor


%       deactivates and a door unlocks at a set time, al-


%       lowing his team to infiltrate a high-security area.


%       He creates a script that will activate at 2200 hours


%       with the following steps:


%       1) At 2200 hours, disable security sensor


%       2) Then unlock door
%  EXAMPLE






%       3) At 2230 relock door


%       4) Then re-enable security sensor


%       5) Eliminate traces


%          This script has 5 steps, which Sarlo can handle


%       with his Programming skill of 70. Sarlo succeeds in


%       his Programming and Infosec Tests, and the script


%       is loaded. It will then activate at the appropriate


%       time. Since Sarlo’s account did not have access


%       rights to perform these actions, each will require


%       an Infosec Test using Sarlo’s skill to succeed.




% CYBERBRAIN HACKING
% Pods and synthmorphs (including some bots and ve-
% hicles) are equipped with cybernetic brains. While this
% technology allows a transhuman ego to sleeve into and
% control these forms, they carry the disadvantage of being
% vulnerable to hacking, like any other electronic device.

% Cyberbrains are not wireless-enabled for security
% reasons, but they do have access jacks (p. 306) and
% are directly linked to mesh inserts. This means that
% in order to hack a cyberbrain, the hacker either must
% have direct physical access to the morph’s body in
% order to jack in, or they must first hack into the mesh
% inserts and then break into the cyberbrain from there.

% Due to their importance, cyberbrains are equipped
% with numerous hard-coded security features that make
% intrusion very difficult. Apply a –30 modifier to all
% attempts to hack into and subvert a cyberbrain. (Note
% that the –30 modifier for hacking an admin account
% does not apply to cyberbrains.)

% Cyberbrains are treated just like other systems for
% intrusion and subversion purposes, but since they
% house the morph’s controlling ego they present several
% unique hacking opportunities.

% ENTRAPMENT
% An intruding character can attempt to lock in an ego,
% preventing it from evacuating the cyberbrain. The
% hacker (with the –30 modifier noted above) must
% beat the defending character or muse in an Opposed
% Infosec Test. If successful, the ego is prevented from
% transferring itself to another system.

% To fully pen the ego in, the ego character and its
% protecting muse must also be locked out (p. 257) from
% controlling the cyberbrain’s system, otherwise the ego
% could potentially be freed.

% Trapped egos are quite vulnerable. They could, for
% example, be subject to enforced uploading, enforced
% forking, or psychosurgery.

% MEMORY HACKING
% All cyberbrains incorporate mnemonic augmentation
% (p. 307), or digitally recorded memories. A hacker
% who has accessed the cyberbrain can read, alter, or
% delete these memories with a successful Research or
% Interfacing Test (the –30 modifier applies).

% PUPPETEERING
% Cyberbrains also incorporate a puppet sock (p. 307),
% enabling remote users to take over the pod or synth-
% morph body and control it via teleoperation or jam-
% ming (p. 196). This allows a hacker to seize control
% of the body and manipulate it remotely. To do so, the
% hacker must take a Complex Action and beat the de-
% fending character or muse in an Opposed Infosec Test;
% the hacker suffers the –30 modifier noted above.

% A defender who is not locked out may continue
% to fight for control of the morph, using a Complex
% Action. In this case, another Opposed Infosec Test
% is called for. This can result in a situation where the
% morph repeatedly slips control from the hacker to the
% defender, or perhaps slips into a catatonic state as the
% two sides battle it out.

% SCORCHING
% Having direct access to a cyberbrain opens the possi-
% bility for certain kinds of attacks that are normally in-
% feasible due to the strict content filtering that occurs on
% the link between the cyberbrain and mesh inserts. One
% of these possibilities is scorching—the use of damaging


%                               —the
% neurofeedback algorithms to harm the victim’s mind.

% In order to make a scorching attack, the cyberbrain
% intruder must deploy a scorch program. To utilize a
% scorch program, the intruder must beat the defending
% Ego in an Opposed Infosec Test. The –30 modifier for
% cyberbrain hacking applies to the attacker.

% Several types of scorch programs exist, with dif-
% ferent effects: cauterizers (damage), bedlams (stress),

% %%% txt/264.txt
% spasms (pain), nightmares (fear), and shutters (sensory
% deprivation). These are described on p. 332 of Gear.

% SHUTDOWN
% If a cyberbrain is shut down (p. 257), the morph im-
% mediately ceases activity, perhaps collapsing or rolling
% to a stop. Pods will appear to be in a coma. The ego,
% however, will be rebooted along with the cyberbrain.

% TERMINATE CORTICAL STACK FEED
% The cyberbrain feeds backup data to the cortical stack.
% This is a one-way connection, so the cortical stack may
% not be hacked, but the transfer of data may be cut off.
% This termination action requires an Opposed Infosec
% Test between the hacker (with the –30 modifier) and
% the defender. The ego’s backup will not be updated for
% as long as the connection remains off.



% RADIO JAMMING
% Radio jamming is a method of transmitting radio
% signals that deliberate interfere with other radio
% signals in order to disrupt communications. In the
% highly-networked world of Eclipse Phase, intentional
% jamming is often illegal, not to mention rude.

% Radio jamming does not require any special equip-
% ment other than a standard wireless device, such as
% an ecto or mesh inserts. Jamming can be selective
% or universal. Selective jamming targets a particular
% device or set of devices. In order to selectively jam,
% the character must have scanned the target device(s)
% (p. 251). Universal devices target all radio-equipped
% devices indiscriminately.

% Jamming simply requires a Complex Action and an
% Interfacing Test. If successful, affected devices within
% range have their radio communications disrupted—
% they are cut off from the mesh and may not commu-
% nicate wirelessly. Wired devices are unaffected.

% Devices equipped by AIs will automatically attempt
% to overcome jamming, which requires a Complex
% Action (transhuman users may also do the same). In
% this case, a Variable Opposed Test is made between
% the jammer and defender. If the jammer wins, all com-
% munications are blocked; if the defender wins, they
% are unaffected. If both parties succeed, the defender’s
% communications are impacted but not completely cut
% off. The gamemaster decides how much information
% the defender can get through, and how this situation
% affects mesh use.

% JAMMING RADAR
% Jamming can also be used to interfere with radar. In
% this case, if the jammer makes an Interface Test. If
% successful, the radar suffers interference, imposing
% a –30 modifier on all sensor-related tests. The entity
% operating the radar may attempt to overcome this
% interference by beating the jammer in an Opposed
% Interface Test.
% SIMULSPACES
% Simulspaces are virtual reality environments where
% the resolution advances beyond realistic high defini-
% tion and into the hyper-real. The environments they
% create are comprehensive and authentic illusions, from
% aspects like lighting, day or lunar cycles, and weather
% down to minute details and sensations. Jacking into
% a simulspace is much like crossing over into a alter-
% nate world or reality, which is why simulspaces have
% become increasingly popular in entertainment.

% While simulspaces usually cannot harm characters
% immersed in them as the sensory algorithms are not
% intended to be offensive programs or routines, experi-
% ences in simulspaces can have a strong psychological
% impact on an ego, as the simulation is as close to
% reality as you can get. A character who is “physically”
% tortured within a simulspace will not be physically
% harmed, but the mental stress of the experience might
% still be sufficient to cause permanent traumas.

% SIMULMORPHS
% Characters access simulspace using an avatar-like per-
% sona called a simulmorph. This simulmorph is created by
% the simulspace, based on the domain rules of the simu-
% lation and certain characteristics of the morph or ego
% accessing the simulation. Depending on the simulation,
% this simulmorph may be customizable to varying degrees.

% While interacting with the simulation, treat simul-
% morphs as basic infomorphs for all rules purposes,
% even if the egos are still possessing another morph
% body in reality.

% When accessing a simulspace, muses are usually not
% transferred into the simulation, though they can po-
% tentially come along if domain rules permit it. In this
% case, muses are treated as separate characters within
% the simulspace with their own simulmorph body.

% Depending on the role a simulspace is intended to play
% in the story, the gamemaster may want to invent “physi-
% cal stats” for the simulmorph bodies, especially if the
% characters are likely to spend a lot of time in the simula-
% tion. These statistics can literally be made up—it is a vir-
% tual reality after all, and anything goes. Alternately, the
% gamemaster can simply wing it and invent any necessary
% statistics on the fly as the need for them comes up.

% IMMERSION
% When a character immerses themselves in a simulspace,
% they “become” the simulmorph. The character’s physi-
% cal body, typically secluded and protected in a vat or
% couch, slumps inertly. While immersed, they suffer –60
% on all Perception Tests or attempts to take action with
% their physical morph. Characters can enter and leave
% the simulspace as will, but toggling in or out takes a
% Complex Action.

% If the simulspace crashes or the character is other-
% wise dumped from it, they immediately resume con-
% trol of their own morph as normal. VR dumpshock is
% extremely jarring, and the character suffers 1d10 ÷ 2
% mental stress.

% %%% txt/265.txt
% EXTERNAL MESH INTERACTION
% A character accessing a simulspace may still interact
% with the mesh (and through it, the outside world)
% assuming the domain rules allow for it. Any outside
% interactions are subject to time dilation issues, how-
% ever. For example, in a simulspace running faster
% than real time, holding a chat with someone in out-
% side meatspace is excruciatingly slow, as real-world
% seconds translate into minutes in VR. If a character
% wishes to directly access other mesh nodes, they must
% toggle or log out of the simulspace.

% SIMULSPACE RULES
% Since a simulspace is an alternate world whose realism
% matches reality, characters use their physical skills and
% aptitudes as if they were acting in the real world with
% few exceptions:

%  • Though intrusion and hacking can be represented

% as another layer of the simulation, there is no

% actual hacking within the simulspace (see Hack-

% ing Simulspaces).
%  • Asyncs cannot use their psi abilities in simulspace,

% though such abilities can be simulated.
%  • Any “physical” damage taken in the simulspace is

% treated as “virtual” damage. While virtual injuries

% and wounds use the same mechanics, characters

% that die in a simulspace are usually simply ejected

% from the simulation. In some cases “dead” char-

% acters are brought into a white room and can

% re-enter or just watch the simulation, depending

% on the domain rules.
%  • Mental stress or trauma inflicted during a simu-

% lation carries over to the ego as real Lucidity

% damage. At the gamemaster’s discretion, some

% mental stress may be reduced if the character is

% aware that they are in a simulation.

% DOMAIN RULES
% Anything goes in a simulspace, as dictated by
% the domain rules. A simulspace may range from
% approximating reality very closely to differing dras-
% tically. Gravity might fluctuate, the visual light spec-
% trum might not exist, characters might heal virtual
% damage effortlessly, simulmorphs may be capable of
% transmogrifying into other creatures, everything might
% be underwater—the possibilities are endless, limited
% only by imagination. In game terms, this allows the
% gamemaster to make up rules on the fly.

% CHEATING
% As with any good game, simulspaces provide ways
% to cheat. Cheats are either built into the simulspace
% software or (externally) programmed in by a hacker.
% Cheats allow for a character to break the domain rules
% in some way. This may be a special power, a way to
% alter some environmental factor (like flying), altering
% the time dilation, some sort of power-up ability, a
% way to get info on other simulmorphs, or a short-cut
% through part of the simulation. In game terms, cheats
% might provide bonus modifiers to certain skill or stat
% tests made by a simulmorph. Cheating is usually for-
% bidden. Players who cheat in a simulspace game and
% who get caught may face eviction from the simulspace.

% HACKING SIMULSPACES
% Since simulspaces are complex virtual environments
% and often run on time dilation, hackers cannot hack
% them in a normal manner when they participate in the
% simulation. There are ways to affect and influence the
% simulation from within, but the degree of subversion
% that is achievable is limited. For this reason, hackers
% rarely enter into VR to hack. Hacking into the exter-
% nal system running a simulspace is just like breaking
% into any other system. Use all of the standard rules for
% intrusion and subversion.

% MEDDLING FROM THE INSIDE
% Within a simulspace, a hacker’s only choice for inter-
% acting with the VR controls is through the standard
% interface that any simulmorph can pull up. Typically
% used for standard user features like adjusting your
% simulmorph or chatting with or checking the status

%  ited, however, as a number of system controls and
%  processes cannot be accessed and manipulated from
%  the inside.

%  Most of the hacker’s options are going to involve
%  meddling with the simulation and its specific domain
%  rules or possibly gaining access to cheats. To make a
%  change requires a successful Interface Test. Ultimately
%  the gamemaster decides what the hacker can and
%  cannot get away with, based on the limitations of that
%  particular simulspace.

%  Most simulspaces are monitored to prevent cheat-
%  ing and abuse, though the monitors are typically pre-
%  occupied with maintaining the simulspace as a whole,
%  dealing with other users, etc. At the gamemaster’s
%  discretion, such a monitor might get to make an Inter-
%  face Test (possibly with a modifier for distraction) to
%  notice the hacker’s efforts.



%  AIS AND MUSES
% AIs are sentient but specialized programs. Like other
% software, they must be run on a computerized system.
% Most AIs are run on bots, vehicles, and other com-
% puterized devices where they can assist transhuman
% users or operate the machine themselves. They are also
% commonly used to actively monitor computer systems
% against intrusion attempts. Muses are AIs that special-
% ize as personal companions, always at a character’s
% virtual side every since they were a child.

% Sample AIs and muses can be found on p. 331 of Gear.

%  AI LIMITATIONS
% AIs feature a number of built-in restrictions and
% limitations. To start with, they can be loaded in the
% cyberbrains of pods and synthmorphs, but they may
% not be downloaded into biomorph brains. As software,
% they use the same rules as other software and may be
% shut down, restarted, copied, erased, stored as inert
% data, infected with virii, and reprogrammed. Due to
% their size and complexity, only one AI (or infomorph)
% may be run on a personal computer at a time (see
% Computer Capabilities, p. 247), and they may not run
% on peripheral devices.

% While they possess cognition and intelligence, they
% are incapable of self-improvement and cannot expand
% their programming and skills on their own. Although
% ACE FROM WITHIN

% pearance of simulmorph, switch simulmorph character or morph type
% -game”) to others
% akes), generate items, ignore domain rules, kill or lockout other

% r the simulation



% they are not able to learn they do possess memory

% storage that grants them the ability to remember and

% a limited form of adaptation. AIs do not earn Rez

% Points, nor do they have Moxie.


% AIs have aptitudes no greater than 20 but are

% incapable of defaulting. If they don’t possess a skill,

% they don’t know how to do it. (At the gamemaster’s

% discretion, they may default to field skills or similar

% skills as noted on p. 173 with a –10 to –30 modifier).

% They can use skills like any character in Eclipse Phase,

% however they may not possess any Active skill at a

% rating higher than 40 or Knowledge skill higher than

% 90—the maximum amount of expertise that their skill

% software allows.


% While AIs are programmed with personality tem-

% plates and empathy, they are generally less emotive

% and difficult to read (apply a –30 modifier to Kinesics

% Test made against them, when in pod bodies). When

% combined with non-expressive synthetic morphs, they

% are even more difficult (–60 modifier). Some AIs lack

% emotive capabilities altogether and are impossible to

% read with Kinesics skill.


% AIs do have a Lucidity and Trauma Threshold stat,

% and are capable of suffering mental stress and traumas.


% COMMANDING AIS

% AIs and muses are programmed to accept commands

% from authorized users. In some circumstances, they

% may also be programmed to follow the law or some

% ethical code. Programming is never perfect, however,

% and AIs can be quite clever in how they interpret

% commands and act on them. In most cases, an AI will

% rarely refuse to follow a request or obey a command.

% Given that they also usually have a duty to protect the

% person commanding them, the AI may be reluctant to

% follow commands that could be construed as danger-

% ous or having a negative impact on the user. Under

% certain circumstances, preprogrammed imperatives

% can force an AI to ignore or disobey their owner’s

% commands (gamemaster’s discretion).




% AGIS AND INFOMORPHS

% The term “infomorph” is used to refer to any ego in

% digital body, whether that be an AGI or the digital

% emulation of a biological mind (including backups

% and forks). The following rules apply to infomorph

% and AGI characters.

% %%% txt/267.txt
% ROLEPLAYING MUSES
% Muses should not be viewed as a mere tool for
% getting extra skills, but as an opportunity to
% enhance roleplaying. Though typical muse AIs
% are not complete intelligences (though they can
% be, see Infomorphs as Muses), their personality
% matrix is often quite sophisticated and they are
% very good at adapting to their user’s personality
% quirks. On the other hand, they share the same
% Real World Naiveté (p. 151) as AGI characters
% when it comes to understanding all the facets
% of transhuman behavior, social interaction,
% body language, or emotion. Their personalities
% are more non-human, abstract, alien, and less
% passionate than transhuman life forms, often
% leading to conceptual misunderstandings and
% miscommunications. Likewise, their creative
% capacities are limited, instead bolstered by an
% ability to calculate odds, run simulations and
% evaluate outcomes, and make predictions based
% on previous experiences.

% Depending on the user’s stance towards sen-
% tient programs, muses can be viewed as intel-
% ligent toys, followers, servants, slaves, friends,
% or pets, which should somehow be reflected in
% game play. Most transhumans have also acquired
% a tendency to bond with a muse mentally due to
% its omnipresence and devotion to the user (like
% bonding to a child or puppy that then grows to
% be an adult). Therefore the subversion or even
% destruction of a muse personality is sometimes
% even equated with rape or murder.              ■





% SOFTWARE MINDS
%  At their core, infomorphs are just programs and so
%  they are treated like other software in terms of rules.
%  They must be run on a specific personal computer or
%  server (see Computer Capabilities, p. 247). If that
%  device is shut down, the infomorph also shuts down
%  into a state of unconsciousness, restarting along with
%  the device (infomorphs may also shut themselves
%  down, though it is rare that they do so). If the device is
%  destroyed, the infomorph is killed along with it (unless
%  their data can somehow be extracted from any surviv-
%  ing components, perhaps resulting in a vapor, p. 274).
%  Infomorphs may copy themselves, though in some
%  places this is illegal and in most places is frowned
%  upon as it raises numerous ethical and legal questions.
%  For this reason many infomorphs that copy and trans-
%  fer themself to run on a new device will thoroughly
%  erase themselves off the old one.

% As digital beings, infomorphs have no physical
%  mind, but it is a simple matter for them to possess
%  an uninhabited synthmorph, taking up residence in
%  the cyberbrain (see Resleeving Synthmorphs, p. 271).

% INFOMORPHS AS

% MUSES

% Instead of relying on underdeveloped muses for

% aid and companionship, characters may prefer to

% have a full-fledged digital intelligence at their

% side, whether that be an AGI, a backed-up bio-

% logical ego, or fork of the character’s own per-

% sonality. Alternately, a character with a ghostrider

% module (p. 307) could have both, carrying a muse

% in their mesh inserts and an infomorph in the

% ghostrider module.

%  This possibility is very useful for infomorph

% player characters, as they can ride along in some-

% one’s head and participate in team affairs with-

% out needing a morph of their own.                 ■



% They may also download into biomorph bodies ac-
% cording to standard resleeving rules (p. 271). Even
% when disembodied, they may interact with the
% physical world via the mesh, viewing through sensors,
% streaming XP feeds, communicating with characters,
% commanding slaved devices, and teleoperating/jam-
% ming drones.

% Infomorphs have a Speed of 3, reflecting their digi-
% tal nature and their ability to act at electronic speeds.
% If an infomorph sleeves into a body, however, it takes
% on the Speed of that morph.

% AGI CHARACTERS
% Though AGIs were not born in a biological body, their
% programming encompasses the full spectrum of human
% personality, outlook, emotions, and mental states. AGIs
% are in fact raised in a manner similar to human chil-
% dren, so that they are socialized much like humans are.
% Nevertheless, on a fundamental level they are non-hu-
% mans programmed to act human. There are inevitably
% points where the programming does not mask or alter
% the fact that AGIs often possess or develop personality
% traits and idiosyncrasies that are quite different from
% human norms and often outright alien.

% Unlike standard crippled AIs, AGIs are capable of
% full-fledged creativity, learning, and self-improvement
% (at a slow but steady pace equivalent to humans). Just
% like other characters, they earn Rez points and may
% improve their skills and capabilities. AGIs suffer none
% of the skill limitations placed on weak AIs, using skills
% just like any other character.

% On an emotional level, AGIs run emotional subrou-
% tines that are comparable to biological human emo-
% tions. AGIs are, in fact, programmed to have empathy
% and share an interest in human affairs and prosperity,
% and to place significant relevance on life of all kinds.
% In game terms, AGIs emote like humans (and so Kine-
% sics may be used against them) and are vulnerable to
% emotionally manipulative effects, fear, etc.

% ERATED FUTURE
%  The future setting of Eclipse Phase introduces a
%  number of technological elements that have a strong
%  impact on transhuman society. These include backups
%  and uploading, resleeving, egocasting, forking, nano-
%  fabrication, reputation systems, space habitats, and
%  space travel, among others.



%  BACKUPS AND UPLOADING
%  The transhuman mind is no longer a prisoner of the
%  biological hardware on which it originates. Through
%  various mechanisms, biological brains may be digitally
%  emulated, allowing people to make a backup of their
%  minds, including their entire personality, memories,
%  and skills—a process known as uploading.

% The primary use of backups is to ensure the person’s
%  ego can be retrieved in case of death, in which case
%  they may be resleeved (p. 271). For this reason, almost
%  everyone in the solar system is equipped with a corti-
%  cal stack (p. 300). Backups may also be safely archived
%  in secure storage (p. 269) or used to create infomorphs
%  (p. 264). A person may also egocast themselves across
%  the solar system as a form of travel (p. 276).

%  CORTICAL STACK BACKUPS
%  Cortical stack implants deploy a network of nano-
%  bots throughout the brain that take a snapshot of
%  the mind’s neural state, storing the data as a backup
%  within the cortical stack. The average transhuman’s
%  cortical stack backs up their ego 86,400 times per day.
%  Only the most recent backup is kept within the stack;
%  older ones are overwritten. Pods and synthmorphs
%  also can be equipped with cortical stacks (though
%  AI-piloted bots often lack this feature), though these
%  versions maintain an updated copy of the ego running
%  in the morph’s cyberbrain.

%  In the case of death, accidental or otherwise, a cor-
%  tical stack can be retrieved from a corpse and used to
%  recover the character, either as an infomorph or by
%  resleeving them in a new morph. Cortical stacks are
%  diamond-hardened and protected, so they may often
%  be retrieved even if the corpse is badly mangled or
%  damaged. If the corpse cannot be recovered or the
%  cortical stack is destroyed, the backup is lost.

%  High rollers, well-equipped brinkers, and others
%  in dangerous professions often opt for an emergency
%  farcaster accessory (p. 306) that periodically (usually
%  every 48 hours, but varying according to contract)
%  transmits a backup from the cortical stack to a remote
%  storage facility. This option is quite expensive, how-
%  ever, and so is generally only afforded by the wealthy.

%  RETRIEVING A CORTICAL STACK
%  Most cortical stacks are carefully excised from a
%  corpse with surgery. In certain circumstances, however,

% a character may need to extract a cortical stack in the

% field, whether because transporting the corpse is im-

% practical or because the dead person is an enemy and

% they either don’t want them knowing who killed them

% or they want to interrogate them with psychosurgery

% in a simulspace.


% The process of cutting out a cortical stack is called
%  “popping,” as a skilled extractor can usually get the

% smooth-shelled implant to pop right out by making

% an incision in the correct place and applying pressure.

% One does need to be careful that the tiny, blood-slick

% stack doesn’t slip away once popped.


% Popping can be done with a sharp knife and elbow

% grease, though it is grisly. Popping a stack is a Task
%  Action that requires a Medicine: [any appropriate

% field] Test with a timeframe of 1 minute and a modi-

% fier of +20. Morphs with stacks in non-standard loca-

% tions or with anatomical shielding (carapace plates,

% etc.) around the stack may incur penalties to this test

% at the gamemaster’s discretion. Of course, if you don’t

% have the time for a precise extraction, you can always

% just cut the entire head off and take it with you.


% Once a cortical stack is retrieved, it may be loaded

% into an ego bridge (p. 328) and used to bring the ego

% back, either as an infomorph or by resleeving.


% Living Subjects: Cortical stacks may be excised

% from living people, but the process is usually fatal (or

% at least paralyzing) as it involves cutting through the

% spinal column. If the target is not unconscious or oth-

% erwise incapacitated, they must first be immobilized

% in melee combat (see Subdual, p. 204). Cutting out

% the stack is handled like a Medicine Task Action as

% above, but this process inflicts 3d10 + 10 damage on

% the target. If the test fails, they still inflict 1d10 + 10

% damage to the target. If the person removing the stack
%  wants to leave the target alive or harm them as little

% as possible, they suffer a –20 modifier on the test, but

% may reduce the damage by 1d10 per 10 full points of

% MoS. Living through the process of having your stack

% removed is traumatic; anyone who does so suffers
%  1d10 mental stress.


% DESTROYING A CORTICAL STACK

% Cortical stacks have an Armor of 20 and a Durability

% of 20 for anyone attempting to destroy them.


% UPLOADING

% Uploading a backup into secure storage is usually

% handled with a brain scan at the storage facility’s clinic

% using a bread box-sized unit called an ego bridge (p.

% 328). When activated, the ego bridge’s sensor array

% twists open like a morning glory blossom, revealing an

% enclosure with a neck rest that automatically adjusts

% itself to morphs with oddly-sized or -shaped heads.

% The neck rest deploys millions of specialized nanobots

% %%% txt/271.txt
% into the brain and central nervous system. The petals
% are full of sensors that image the brain using a combi-
% nation of MRI, sonogram, and positional information
% broadcast by the nanobot swarm in the morph’s brain.
% The ego bridge then builds a digital copy of the per-
% son’s brain, which is stored away in the service’s highly
% secure, off-the-mesh, hardwired data vaults.

% In the case of pods, the ego bridge scans the biologi-
% cal brain bits and also accesses the cyberbrain to copy
% the parts of the ego residing there. For synthmorphs,
% who have no biological brain, the process is much
% simpler, as it simply requires accessing and making a
% copy of their cyberbrain.

% In a standard clinic with an undamaged morph, up-
% loading takes only 10 minutes, 5 with a pod. In other
% situations, however, the process may take longer if the
% gamemaster so decides. Uploading from a synthmorph
% or extracted cortical stack is instantaneous. The ego
% bridge largely operates itself. While oversight by a
% medical specialist is a good idea, no test is necessary.

% If an uploading character does not plan to return
% to their morph, it is usually put on ice until someone
% else resleeves into it. If a new resleeve is not ready
% and the uploading character doesn’t want to leave a
% potential copy of themselves behind, they can have
% the morph’s mind wiped by the nanobots as part of
% the uploading process.

% UPLOADING-RESLEEVING CONTINUITY
% In ideal circumstances, a person who is intentionally
% resleeving (p. 271) can arrange for the uploading and
% resleeving process to occur with any noticeable loss of
% continuity. Though the experience of switching from
% one morph to another is still a bit jarring, the transi-
% tion itself can be made into a seamless process, with
% no gaps in awareness or memory, which helps reduce
% associated mental stress.

% In this case, during the process of uploading, the
% ego bridge is also connected to another ego bridge
% and the new sleeve. This connection can even be made
% wirelessly or by farcaster link (with a maximum dis-
% tance of 10,000 kilometers).

% As the mind is uploaded, the ego bridge builds a
% virtual brain by copying the morph’s brain bit by bit,
% using the data gained from the brain scan. At the same
% time, this data is slowly copied to the new sleeve as
% nanobots rewire the sleeve’s brain structure (a much
% slower process). As the transfer occurs, the nanobots
% in the brain sever individual neural connections and
% re-route them to their duplicates in the virtual brain,
% and then eventually to the new brain. Effectively, the
% character’s ego is running partially on the meat brain
% and partially on the virtual copy. By the time the nano-
% bots sever the last of the neural connections in the
% old brain, the ego is running completely on the virtual
% brain and the new sleeve’s brain. Once the resleeving
% is completed, the virtual brain is shut down.

% In terms of perceptions, the character, who is awake
% during this process, experiences a very gradual shift
% from one morph to the other. As the process takes
% hours, however (or even longer if done via farcaster),
% the subject usually entertains themselves with some
% AR media, VR, or even XP to pass the time.

% UPLOADING AFTER DEATH
% It is possible to upload the mind of a person who has
% recently died as long as the nanobots have time to scan
% the brain before cell deterioration kicks in too heavily,
% which takes approximately 2 hours. It is possible to
% sustain a corpse for longer by placing it in a healing
% vat (p. 326) for nanostasis. Post-death uploads may
% suffer integrity damage; see Backup Complications, p.
% 270.

% Cyberbrains may also be retrieved from a destroyed
% synthmorph and reactivated, assuming they are not
% damaged too heavily (gamemaster discretion).

% DESTRUCTIVE UPLOADING
% Though rare, some people engage in a process called
% destructive uploading, where the biological brain is liter-
% ally sliced apart and scanned piece by piece. Considered
% abhorrent and wasteful by most transhumans, “brain-
% peeling” is practiced by some bioconservative factions
% who view it as the only “pure” method of uploading
% or the only real way to transfer the “soul.” Such people
% typically refuse to resleeve, living out the rest of their
% lives as infomorphs, quite often in dedicated simulspaces
% that are treated as a sort of virtual afterlife.

% BACKUP INSURANCE
% Almost everyone, with the exception of neo-primitivists
% and very young children, has a cortical stack. In the
% event of death, however, a cortical stack alone will not
% ensure resurrection unless you have acquired backup
% insurance (p. 330) to cover the costs of your resleev-
% ing. Going without backup insurance for any length of
% time is taking a severe risk. Some jurisdictions (such
% as the Titanian Commonwealth) have a practice of
% bringing everyone back, even if only to an infomorph
% state, or at least filing the most recent backup away
% in dead storage just in case someone decides to pay
% to resurrect them later. Other authorities will simply
% destroy the stack or, worse, sell it on the black market
% to a soul-trading syndicate such as Nine Lives.

% Backup insurance typically includes a subscription
% to an uploading facility, usually requiring a visit every
% 6 months, to ensure that backup is held in safe stor-
% age in case of cortical stack loss. People with risky
% jobs (construction bot supervisor, hypercorp exo-
% planet staff, girl who fights vicious giant eels for rich
% jaded audiences, etc.) may back up once a week, or
% even daily. In the event of a verified death where the
% cortical stack could not be retrieved, the most recent
% backup is used to resleeve the person.

% At the basic level, backup insurance will bring the
% character back as an infomorph, at which point they
% can access their credit and purchase a new morph.
% More expensive versions will automatically resleeve

% %%% txt/272.txt
% you in the pre-purchased morph of your choice. The
% exceedingly rich will often have customized clones
% (often of their original body) waiting on ice for them.

% Backup insurance often involves a missing person
% clause, which states that a person will be brought
% back if they have not checked in for X amount of time
% (a calendar function automatically handled by your
% muse) and cannot be located.

% It is worth noting that some criminal syndicates
% also offer backup insurance at a much reduced rate.
% The likelihood that copies of your backup are being
% used for illicit purposes, however, is quite high. For
% some people, however, what happens to a copy of
% themselves is of no concern.

% BACKUP INSURANCE LIMITATIONS
% Backup insurance is not always perfect. Though in-
% surance providers are required to make a reasonable
% effort to retrieve your cortical stack, for many hyper-
% corps this is a simple cost-benefit analysis that often
% will not work in the character’s favor. If you died in a
% dangerous area such as the Zone on Mars, in a remote
% area such as the Kuiper Belt, or are simply difficult
% to track down (pushed out an airlock somewhere),
% odds are against your cortical stack being retrieved—
% instead you will be re-instanced from a backup.

% Jurisdiction can also play an important role. The
% insurance offered by many inner system providers is
% automatically nullified if you travel to an anarchist
% habitat, gatecrash, break the law, or engage in certain
% life-threatening activities like suicide sports or scaveng-
% ing in TITAN-infected ruins. At the least, they will
% refuse to retrieve your stack in these circumstances.
% Likewise, if you struck a backup insurance deal with
% a medical collective from an autonomist habitat and
% then go and die on a hypercorp station, the hypercorp
% is very likely to refuse to recognize the authority of a
% bunch of anarchists and won’t hand your stack over.

% Even an archived backup and a missing person
% clause is no guarantee. A determined enemy could
% capture you, pry the backup insurance access codes
% from your muse, keep you on ice or quietly kill you,
% and then regularly “check in” on your behalf using
% the access codes so that the insurance provider never
% realizes you are dead or missing. Though this requires
% quite a bit of effort, it is often less difficult than deal-
% ing with an immortal opponent who keeps coming
% back no matter how often you kill them.

% Other dangers also exist. An entire habitat may be
% destroyed, taking you, your backups, and your insur-
% ance provider’s records with it. A resourceful enemy
% might penetrate a provider’s security and delete your
% backups, or simply bribe the right people to make
% sure they get “accidentally” corrupted. Given these
% possibilities, the paranoid often make sure to get
% multiple redundant backup policies, assuming they
% can afford it.

% BACKUP COMPLICATIONS
% In most cases, backing up/uploading is risk free unless
% someone tampers with the equipment. If the character
% suffered brain or neurological damage, the backup is
% transferred via farcasting, or the upload is made from
% a dead character, then the backup may be damaged
% due to missing neural information. In any of these
% instances, make a LUC Test for the character. If the
% test fails, they suffer 1 point of mental stress per 10
% full points of MoF. Note that this stress (and pos-
% sible) trauma applies to the backup, not the original
% character. If the backup is used to re-instantiate the
% character, however, then the stress is applied.



% RESLEEVING
% Resleeving (also called remorphing) is the process
% of giving a new body to an ego. Changing bodies
% is a normal part of life for hundreds of millions of
% transhumans, and it is an even more frequent occur-
% rence for people in certain professions. Characters
% involved in specialized work may resleeve as often as
% once a month. Those who travel frequently may do so
% even more often. Also, given the number of infugees

% %%% txt/273.txt

% who died during the Fall but have now acquired a

% new morph, the vast majority of transhumanity has

% resleeved at least once. As such, most transhumans are

% accustomed to resleeving.

%  Adjusting to a new body takes time and a bit of

% effort (see Integration, p. 272). Resleeving is also diffi-

% cult psychologically, as reflected by continuity (p. 272)

% and alienation (p. 272).

%  Once an ego fully inhabits a new morph, the new

% morph’s cortical stack needs ten minutes to amass a

% complete backup of the ego.


% RESLEEVING BIOMORPHS AND PODS

% Resleeving takes about an hour in a properly equipped

% clinic. In essence, the process works like uploading in

% reverse. The new sleeve is hooked up to an ego bridge

% which infiltrates the brain with nanobots that physi-

% cally restructure the brain’s neural structure and con-

% nections according to the map provided by the backup.

% Sleeving takes six times as long as uploading because

% the nanobot swarm working as a wet printer in the

% template brain needs to duplicate the entire physical

% structure of the ego’s neural network. For resleeving, a
%  “wet” ego bridge is used, meaning that the sleeve and

% ego bridge are submerged in a vat filled with nanogel.


% The resleeving process for pods takes only half an hour,

% as pods brains are half biological and half cyberbrain.


% RESLEEVING SYNTHMORPHS

% Resleeving into the cyberbrain of a synthmorph is much

% easier and quicker, being a matter of copying the backup

% into the cyberbrain (an instantaneous affair) and then

% running the backup in its virtual brain state (1 Action

% Turn). The drawback to synthmorphs is that they are

% more difficult to acclimate to (see Integration, p. 272),




% RESLEEVING AND THE GA
% The gamemaster has a fine amount of control over
% characters may be supplied with new morphs by Firew

% synthmorphs are viewed as low class in some cultures.


% EVACUATING A CYBERBRAIN

% Characters inhabiting a synthmorph cyberbrain may

% voluntarily choose to evacuate by copying themselves

% as an infomorph onto another device. This takes 1 full

% Action Turn. See Infomorph Resleeving, p. 273.


%  RESLEEVING COSTS

% The costs involved for the resleeving process itself are

% generally subsumed in the costs of the backup insur-

% ance and/or the new sleeve itself. Costs for individual

% morphs are noted in the descriptions starting on p.

% 139. See Morph Brokerage (p. 276) for rules on find-

% ing and acquiring morphs.


%  INTEGRATION

%  Getting used to a new body typically takes some time.

% The character must become acclimated to the changes

%  in height, weight, sex, and capabilities, which often

%  requires unlearning ways of doing things that worked

%  fine for their previous form. Resleeving in a synthetic

%  morph or an uplift is also quite confusing at first,

%  given the drastically different morphologies, change in

%  limb structure (and sometimes amount of limbs), and

%  so on. Luckily, transhuman minds are adaptive things,

%  and this process is aided by the application of mental

% “patches” during the resleeving process that give the

%  character a bit of a boost for using their new body.


%   An ego in a new morph makes an Integration Test

%  upon taking control of the body, rolling SOM x 3 (morph

%  bonuses do not apply) and applying modifiers from the

%  Integration and Alienation Modifiers table. The result of

%  the test is explained on the Integration Test table, p. 272.

%    ALIENATION TEST


%                             EFFECT
% Extreme Dysmorphia. The character doesn’t like their new sleeve at all
% and suffers 2 stress points per 10 full points of MoF.
% Character is uneasy about the new morph and suffers 1 stress point
% per 10 full points of MoF.
% Character adapts to their new look well. No ill effects.
% Best. Morph. Ever. The new morph jives perfectly with the character’s
%  ense of self, and even enhances it somewhat. The character actually
% heals 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) stress points.
% ALIENATION
% After loss of continuity, the other major factor impact-
% ing resleeving characters is alienation. Once the ego
% has its new sleeve under control, it’s time to look in
% the mirror. The alienation test reflects the experience of
% coming to terms with a new face, skin, and brain. For
% example, transferring to a radically different morph
% (such as a swarmanoid) can be difficult to grasp.
% Uplifts often have difficulty getting acquainted with
% the differing hormonal urges of a human biomorph
% and vice versa. While the character’s ego is as it was
% in their last sleeve, the brains and neurochemistry of
% many morphs may alter aptitudes like WIL or COG.
% The effects of this can be frustrating or disorienting.

% Every character makes an Alienation Test to reflect
% how mentally stressful it is to get a grip on their new
% body, rolling INT x 3 and apply modifiers from the
% Integration and Alienation Modifiers table. Consult
% the Alienation Test table to determine the effects.

% CONTINUITY TEST
% Perhaps the biggest shock that strikes most resleeving
% characters is the loss of continuity of self. This is par-
% ticularly true for characters who died. If their cortical
% stack was retrieved, they will remember their own
% death. If they were restored from an archived backup,
% they will not remember their death, but they will have
% lost an entire period of their life—all the way back to
% their last backup. In fact, if their body was not recov-
% ered, they may not even know that they are dead for
% certain—there may be a surviving copy of themselves
% out there. The driving point in this loss of continuity is
% a sort of existential crisis—they are no longer the origi-
% nal person they once were. This leads some to question
% whether they are who they think they are, or are they
% some poor imitation and not a real person at all?

% To determine how this loss of continuity affects a
% character, make a Continuity Test by rolling WIL x 3.
% Every character suffers stress from loss of continuity,
% as noted on the Continuity Stress table. Reduce this
% stress damage by 1 point per 10 full points of MoS on
% the Continuity Test, or increase it by 1 point for every
% 10 full points of MoF.

% INFOMORPH RESLEEVING
% Rather than resleeving into a physical body, a backup
% may instead by instantiated as an infomorph, a purely
% digital form. Infomorphs are distinct from backups in
% that backups are inert files. Infomorphs are backups
% imprinted onto a virtual brain template and run as
% a program. This virtual brain state must be run on a
% specific device and follows all of the rules noted for
% infomorphs on p. 264. Infomorphs may copy them-
% selves to other devices, typically erasing themselves
% from the previous device as they go. Infomorphs that
% copy without erasing are treated as forks.

% Characters instantiating as infomorphs must make
% Continuity and Alienation Tests, just like resleeving.

% Infomorphs may be resleeved into physical morphs,
% following normal resleeving rules.

% FORKING AND MERGING
% With all of these backups of transhuman minds on
% file and an abundance of mesh space on which to run
% them as virtual brains, one might wonder what’s to
% stop post-Fall transhumanity from multiplying its
% numbers by running additional copies of them. The
% short answer is: nothing, aside from massive social
% stigma and thorny psychological issues. Taking a
% backup of a transhuman mind, copying it, and re-
% instancing it as an infomorph is called forking. It’s one
% of the most useful and still-controversial applications
% of transhumanity’s brain science.

% There are four classifications of forks: alpha, beta,
% delta, and gamma. Though typically copied as info-
% morphs, there is nothing preventing a fork from being
% sleeved in a physical morph as well, other than legali-
% ties and custom.

% ALPHA FORKS
% An alpha fork is an exact copy of the original ego,
% re-instanced as a separate infomorph. An alpha fork
% may be created by copying and running an infomorph
% (from a backup, infomorph, synthmorph cyberbrain,
% or directly from the cortical stack). Alpha forks are an
% exact copy of the character’s ego, with all of the same
% skills, memories, stats, traits, personality, etc. New
% alpha forks must make an Alienation Test (p. 272),
% and possibly a Continuity Test (p. 272) if copied from
% a backup.

% Creating alpha forks is illegal in many jurisdic-
% tions, including most of the inner system and the
% Jovian Republic. In others it tends to be viewed with
% distaste, though there are some habitats/cultures in
% which it is encouraged.

% BETA FORKS
% Beta forks are partial copies of the ego. They are
% intentionally hobbled so as to not to be considered
% an equal to the character, for legal and other reasons.
% Beta forks have most of the same skills as the original
% ego, though sometimes reduced. Their memories are

%  also drastically curtailed, usually tailored to whatever
%  task they are intended to perform.

% Beta forks are created by a process known as
%  neural pruning (p. 274). They are legal and even
%  common in many places, except for bioconservative
%  holdouts like the Jovian Republic, though delta forks
%  are more favored. Beta forks rarely have anything
%  resembling civil rights or citizenship and are usually
%  treated as the property of the originating ego. They
%  are commonly used as digital aids or to represent the
%  original ego when communicating with others over
%  great distances.

% A beta fork’s stats are determined as follows:


% • Reduce all aptitudes by 5 (to a minimum of 1).

%  This affects all skills as well. Likewise, this re-

%  duces LUC by 10 and INIT by 20.

% • Active skills have a maximum value of 60.

% • Moxie is reduced to 1.

% • The Psi trait is removed. At the gamemaster’s dis-

%  cretion, other traits may no longer apply as well.


% Additional changes may apply as determined by
%  the neural pruning test. Beta forks take 1 minute
%  to generate.

%  DELTA FORKS
% Delta forks are extremely limited copies of an ego.
% They are more akin to AI templates upon which
% the ego’s surface personality traits are imprinted.
% Also created via neural pruning, delta forks are
% highly functional (as competent as a beta fork or
% AI) but have extremely limited skills and heav-
% ily edited memories, usually to the point of being
% functional amnesiacs.

% A delta fork’s stats are determined as follows:


% • Reduce all aptitudes by 10 (to a minimum of 1).

%  This affects all skills as well. Likewise, this re-

%  duces LUC by 20 and INIT by 40.

% • Active skills have a maximum value of 40. The

%  fork may have no more than 5 Active skills.

% %%% txt/276.txt
%  • Knowledge skills have a maximum of 80. The

% fork may have no more than 5 Knowledge skills.
%  • Moxie is reduced to 0.
%  • The Psi trait is removed. At the gamemaster’s dis-

% cretion, other traits may no longer apply as well.


% Additional changes may apply as determined by the
% neural pruning test. Delta forks take 1 Action Turn to
% generate.

% GAMMA FORKS
% More commonly known as vapors, gamma forks are
% massively incomplete, corrupted, or heavily damaged
% copies of an ego. Vapors are not intentionally cre-
% ated and are instead the results of botched uploads,
% scrambled backups, incomplete or jammed farcasts,
% or infomorphs/forks that were somehow damaged or
% went insane. It is extremely rare for anyone to pur-
% posely create a vapor for anything other than research
% use, although they can crop up in some interesting
% places. For example, poorly made skill software occa-
% sionally includes enough of the personality traits and
% memories of the person the skill was taken from that
% it can behave in a vapor-like fashion when used.

% Because vapors are anomalies rather than purpose-
% ful creations, the characteristics of individual gamma
% forks are left to the gamemaster. They should have
% some or all of the following: reduced skills, reduced
% aptitudes, incomplete or incoherent memories, nega-
% tive mental traits, and persistent mental stress or trau-
% mas, including derangements and/or disorders.

% NEURAL PRUNING
% Most forking is done on the fly—something comes up
% that the character needs a fork for, so they whip one
% up on the spot. Neural pruning is the art of taking a
% backup/infomorph and trimming it down to size so
% that it functions as either a beta or delta fork.

% Beta forks are created by taking a virtual mind state
% that is intentionally inhibited and filtering a copy of
% the ego through it. Like a topiary shrub, the portions
% of the character’s neural network that exceed the ca-
% pacities of the intended fork are trimmed away. In ad-
% dition to the changes noted under Beta Forks (p. 273),
% characters may voluntarily choose to delete/decrease
% skills and remove memories.

% Delta forks are created by excising the ego’s surface
% personality traits and applying them to an AI template.
% In this case the ego’s memories are usually excluded
% entirely—it is easier to start with a blank delta fork
% and feed them the specific memories/knowledge they
% need. As with beta forks, characters making delta
% forks may voluntarily choose to delete/decrease skills
% and keep specific memories.

% Transhumanity’s grasp of neuroscience extends to
% scanning and copying a mind, but the most intricate
% workings of memory are still imperfectly understood.
% Making precise edits to individual portions of a neural
% network (to alter recollections, skills, and the like) is
% still a black art. The difficulty with neural pruning is
% that taking a weed whacker to the tree of memory
% isn’t an exact science. Specific memories may not be
% excised or chosen—at best, memories may be handled
% in broad clumps, typically grouped by time periods no
% finer than 6 months. For simplicity, most beta forks are
% created by removing all memories older than 1 year.

% When creating a beta or delta fork, the character
% must make a Psychosurgery Test (other parties may
% make this test on the character’s behalf, representing
% that the character is giving them access to prune the
% fork appropriately). If the character succeeds, the fork
% is created as desired. If the test fails, the gamemaster
% chooses one of the following penalties for every 10
% full points of MoF. Some of these penalties may be
% combined for a cumulative effect:


% • 1 additional skill decreased by –20

% • Fork acquires a Negative mental trait worth 10 CP

% • Fork suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress

% • Extra memory loss (gamemaster discretion; beta

%  forks only)

% • 1 Positive trait lost

% NEURAL PRUNING WITH LONG-TERM PSYCHOSURGERY
% Rather than generating forks on the fly, some char-
% acters prefer to have carefully-pruned forks on hand,
% stored as inert files that can be called up, copied, and
% run as needed. These forks are crafted with long-term
% psychosurgery, meaning that they suffer fewer draw-
% backs and the memories may be more finely tuned.

% Long-term neural pruning requires a Psychosurgery
% Test as above, but with a +30 modifier. Delta forks take
% 1 week to prune this way, beta forks take 1 month. Ad-
% ditional modifications may be made to the fork using
% any of the normal rules for psychosurgery (p. 229).

% It is worth noting that some people prefer to use
% forks of themselves or loved ones rather than a muse.
% Likewise, some wealthy hyperelites are known to keep
% copies of their younger backups on hand, sometimes
% for decades, and re-instance these when their prime
% ego has enough skill and experience to completely
% outclass its younger selves. Though technically these
% are alpha forks, their lag behind the original ego is
% comparable in degree to that of a beta fork. This is
% rumored to be the method used by the Pax Familiae
% in instancing her army of cloned selves.

% HANDLING FORKS
% Gamemasters are encouraged to allow players to ro-
% leplay their character’s own forks. It is important to
% note, however, that even with alpha forks, once the
% fork and originating ego diverge, they develop onward
% as separate people. The events that shape the primary
% ego’s personality, character, and knowledge will not
% happen—or even if they do, probably not in the same
% way—to the fork, and vice versa. The exact dividing
% line between an ego and a fork is a central philosophi-
% cal and legal debate among many transhumans.

% This means that gamemaster should not be afraid
% to pull a fork out of a player character’s hands and

% %%% txt/277.txt
%  make them into an NPC if they start too diverge too
%  greatly. Similarly, if a fork begins to learn information
%  that the main character does not (yet) have access to,
%  it is probably also better to run the fork as an NPC in
%  order to avoid metagaming.

%  It is entirely possible that a fork might decide that
%  it will no longer obey the originating ego and carry
%  about doing its own thing. This usually only occurs
%  with alpha forks, who are essentially a full copy
%  anyway, and as time passes the idea of merging back
%  with the original ego becomes unappealing. Beta and
%  delta forks are quite aware of their nature as “incom-
%  plete” copies, and so usually return back home to the
%  ego for reintegration. In rare cases, however, even
%  these might make a break for life on their own.

%  MERGING

% Merging is the process of re-integrating a previous-
% ly-spawned fork with the originating ego. Merging is
% performed on conscious egos/forks, transferring both
% to a single, merged ego. The process is not difficult
% to undergo when two forks have only been apart a
% short time. As forks spend more time apart, though,
% merging becomes a severe mental ordeal.

% To determine if merging goes well, a Psychosurgery
% Test is called for (made either by the ego or another
% character overseeing the process). The Merging table
% lists modifiers for this test as well as the result of suc-
% cess or failure.

% For synthmorphs, merging takes one full Action
% Turn. For biomorphs, an ego bridge (p. 328) or mne-
% monic augmentation (p. 307) is required to merge,
% and the process takes 10 minutes.

% The result of the process is a unified ego, whether
% or not the Merging Test succeeds. Psychotherapy (p.
% 209) and psychosurgery (p. 229) can troubleshoot bad
% merges over time.



%  EGOCASTING
%  In spite of being a spacefaring civilization with out-
%  posts throughout the solar system and beyond, tran-
%  shumanity makes scant use of spacecraft for interplan-
%  etary travel. Shuttlecraft using a variety of propulsion
%  systems make regular trips between habitats, planetary
%  surfaces, and moons. But for any trip longer than 1.5
%  million kilometers—the distance a fusion drive craft
%  can cover in a day—people egocast.

%     THE SELF


%     Forking and merging have changed the way


%     transhumanity thinks about the self and what


%     it means to have a well-integrated personality.


%        While forking is child’s play from a tech


%     nological standpoint, the psychological and


%     social effects of cloning a mind mean that


%     most people are cautious about employing


%     forks. Some jurisdictions ban forking outright


%     for all but medical uses, while others have


%     severe restrictions. In many hypercorp juris


%     dictions, for instance, alpha forks are illegal


%     and letting a beta fork run for more than 4


%     hours without merging violates the modern


%     descendants of 20th-century anti-trust laws


%     Similarly, the Jovian Junta and other biocon


%     servatives ban forking entirely.


%        Disposing of unwanted forks is another


%     thorny issue. In some places, it’s as simple as


%     deleting them, because a stored mind has no


%     legal status. In others, a fork that doesn’t wish


%     to merge back with its originating ego might


%     be accorded some rights, though these are


%     generally only granted to alpha forks.


%        Most significantly, though, running a short


%     term fork of oneself for periods of an hour


%     or less is an easy task for many transhumans


%     Many people use forks of themselves to get


%     work done in everyday life, and almost every


%     one has at least experimented with forking at


%     some point.


%        Transhumans view forking a bit like early


%     21st-century humans viewed drinking and drug


%     use. A bit might be okay, but someone overdo


%     ing it will be stigmatized. This is because most


%     transhumans understand the psychological


%     consequences of overusing forks.               ■

% Egocasting within a cluster or planetary system is
% usually just a matter of minutes. Egocasting from the
% sun to the Kuiper Belt, however, takes between 40 and
% 70 hours, and so egocasting all of the way across the
% solar system can take even longer.

% Once an ego arrives at the destination receiver, it
% can be archived, run as an infomorph, or resleeved
% as normal.

% EGOCASTER SECURITY
% Beaming yourself across interplanetary space is a
% mature technology and usually works seamlessly. Be-
% cause egocasting uses quantum farcasters, there is no
% danger of radio interference cooking the signal and
% causing data loss. Normally the entire process is medi-
% ated by the character’s backup service, and security
% breaches are uncommon.

% However, there are several risks involved in ego-
% casting. The most obvious is that the character’s con-
% sciousness is transferred as a digital backup file at the
% destination. If the egocaster on the other end is not
% trusted or the networks at the destination are privately
% controlled by the receiver, the character is potentially
% putting themself at the mercy of their host. Most hy-
% percorps consider meddling with a transmitted ego to
% be a serious breach of etiquette, whereas autonomist
% types would find it unthinkably repressive. However,
% political extremist groups and criminal organizations
% in control of egocasters suffer from fewer restraints.

% A more subtle risk is the possibility for hackers to
% exploit security holes in the egocaster and its attached
% virtual space to steal a fork of the character. This is
% extremely difficult to do. It almost never happens
% during a normal upload, because the uploading ser-
% vices are security conscious to the point of paranoia.
% Even so, the forks stolen by such attempts more often
% than not end up being vapors, because the intruder
% is usually stopped before a full copy can be obtained.
% DARKCASTING

% Characters who want to egocast without the atten-
% tion of public officials like Immigration and Customs
% must seek out so-called darkcasting services—illegal
% farcaster transceivers typically operated by criminal
% syndicates and other clandestine groups. To locate
% such a service, a character must use their Networking
% skill and possibly their reputation (p. 285).



% MORPH BROKERAGE
% Morphs are a major commodity in transhuman society.
% The technology and materials needed to grow new
% morphs are cheap and abundant, though they take
% time. Cloned biomorphs take at least a year and a half,
% even with accelerated growth. Pods, which are typi-
% cally pieced together from vat-grown parts, take about
% 6 months. Synthmorphs like cases and synths can be
% produced in a day, whereas more complicated models
% can take a week or more. Theoretically, supply will one
% day outstrip demand to the point where flesh is free.

% Characters have several options for acquiring
% morphs when they travel by egocast, suffer heavy
% damage, or just feel like a new body. When egocasting,
% the most common method for travelers of middling
% means is to store their current morph in a body bank’s
% secure facility and lease a morph at their destina-
% tion. Less commonly, characters may rely on public
% resleeving facilities, or, if they have the means, they
% may purchase a new morph outright. Characters who
% expect to stay at their destination indefinitely or who
% decide to resleeve but aren’t traveling might instead
% opt for a trade-in on their old body, leaving it behind
% permanently in most cases.

% MORPH AVAILABILITY
% As noted under Resleeving and the Gamemaster (p. 271),
% finding the model of morph you want is not always easy.
% While many basic morph types (cases, synths, splicers)

% %%% txt/279.txt
% are generally available, characters can also locate new
% morphs using their Networking skills (see Reputation
% and Social Networks, p. 285). Certain morph types
% are harder to find then others; the gamemaster should
% apply an appropriate modifier for any morphs that seem
% rare or unusual (for example, swarmanoids or reapers).
% Likewise, some morphs may simply be unavailable in a
% given locale. Rusters are rarely available off of Mars, for
% example, while on Europa, most morphs are exotic local
% aquatic varieties.

% The gamemaster determines which factions are able
% to provide new morphs in a given locale. Factions
% will not provide morphs that are unavailable to that
% faction as starting characters. If the faction is not the
% dominant one in that locale, a penalty should be ap-
% plied, ranging from –10 to –30. Despite having a pres-
% ence in a given locale, some factions may be unable to
% provide morphs at all.

% If the character is seeking a customized morph with
% specific implants or enhancements, the search will be
% more challenging. The gamemaster should apply a –10
% to –30 modifier here as well, depending on the extent
% and legality of the modifications sought.

% MORPH ACQUISITION
% Once a morph is located, the character may call in
% favors (p. 285) or pay credits for it. Morph costs are
% noted on the Morph Costs table. In the inner system,
% morph prices are often inflated by demand in the
% market such that the most desirable morph types can
% cost a small fortune. Outsystem, prices in rep are more
% reasonable but still steep due to population pressures
% on life support-dependent outer system settlements.
% For travelers and frequent body hoppers, there are a
% number of ways to defray these costs.

% BROKERAGE AND MATCHMAKING
% Finding morphs for travelers and the bodiless is a
%  specialized skill demanding deep social networks and
% a flair for negotiation. In general, it’s a seller’s market,
%  so brokers (or “matchmakers,” as they’re called in
% the open economy) act as agents for the person seek-
% ing a body. The Morph Costs table assumes a 10%
% fee paid to the broker. Characters wishing to cut out
% the middleman may reduce cost by 10% but take a
% –30 penalty on their Networking Test to locate an
% available morph.

% CUSTOMIZED MORPHS
% If a character seeks to have a customized morph (with
% extra bioware, cyberware, or nanoware implants or
% robotic enhancements), the costs for these enhance-
% ments are added to the morph’s cost (if the gamemaster
% chooses, discount package deals may apply). Likewise,
% morphs may come saddled with positive or negative
% morph traits (p. 145). These traits raise or lower the
% morph’s cost at a rate of +500 credits per CP for posi-
% tive traits, or –200 credits per CP of negative traits.
% Negative traits typically reflect abuses the morph has
% suffered at the hands of previous occupants.

%  TRADE-IN
%  For those who wish to leave their old morph behind
%  permanently, trade-ins on current morphs are an
%  option. The high demand for bodies means that a buyer
%  is almost always available unless the gamemaster finds
%  extenuating circumstances. Morphs may be traded in
%  for the value shown on the Morph Costs table (ad-
%  justed for any positive or negative traits), less a 10%
%  physical exam and finder’s fee. This is either paid to the
%  morph broker in cred or rendered as a favor using rep.


% PATRON PROVISIONING
%  Characters on missions for rich or influential patrons
%  may have morphs provided for them. Normally
%  such provisions are made for the duration of a job,
%  although less commonly the morph itself might be
%  payment for services rendered. Gamemasters are
%  encouraged to be creative with such arrangements,
%  though players should be advised that such bargains
%  can quickly turn Faustian.


% BLACK MARKET MORPHS
%  Black market body traders promise to provide the
%  buyer with morphs and upgrades of choice regardless
%  of a habitat’s laws against weapons or implants, in
%  addition to bypassing standard arrival registration
%  via darkcasting. Illegal morphs usually come with a
%  price markup (+25% at least), whereas used morphs
%  with unsavory backgrounds (and traits) can usually be
%  acquired on the cheap (–25%).


% INDENTURE
%  Characters who find themselves too destitute to
%  afford a new morph can strike a deal for indentured
%  service—a “deal” that is rarely advantageous to the

% %%% txt/280.txt

% new indenture. Typical contracts require years of in-

% dentured labor—terraforming Mars, herding comets,

% asteroid mining, constructing habitats, colonizing

% exoplanets, etc.—in exchange for a cheap synthetic

% morph or splicer at the end of the term. Gamemasters

% may use their discretion in offering such terms, though

% in many cases the terms offered will temporarily or

% permanently end the character’s career as a free agent.

% Hypercorps using indentured labor are notorious for

% changing the terms at a whim, extending the service

% period, or slamming the indenture with a slew of

% hidden and outrageous charges that were not made

% clear up front. Characters may, of course, enter into

% such service fully intending to grab their morph and

% run at the first opportunity, but the hypercorps are

% very protective of their investments. Indentures are



%  USTOM-GROWN OR
% DESIGNED MORPHS
% me people are very particular about their morphs.
%  them, nothing “off the shelf” will do, even if it’s
% customized model tricked out with specific im-
% ants, traits, and biosculpting. Instead, they desire
% mething unique, something that must be specially
% own or designed.
%  n the case of biomorphs, this can mean several
%  ngs. Usually it means that the patron desires a
% ry specific set of genetic traits. This could be traits
%  m their original genetic lineage, traits copied from
% meone they idolized or honored, genes artfully
% afted by a renowned genetic designer, or mystery
%  its purchased at great expense from the Factors or
% tracted from a lost TITAN lab. Alternatively, it could
% ean the client seeks something more specific, such
%  an exact duplicate clone of their original body.
% While it is possible to put an existing morph in a
%  aling vat and alter its genetics with metamorph-
% g nanovirii in a matter of days, these procedures
% e difficult and prone to disaster. In many cases, it
% preferred to simply grow the desired clone from
%  atch, though even with accelerated growth this
% kes from 1.5 to 2 years (or 6 months to 1 year in
% e case of pods). Nevertheless, some hyperelites
%  ve taken steps to ensure that the morph they
%  sire is available at all likely egocast destinations.
% Though rarer, custom synthmorphs are sometimes
% ught after, usually by people who wish to showcase
%  ique or artistic robotic designs, but sometimes also

% engineers or agents who are field-testing proto-
% pes. Assuming blueprints are available, such models
% n be constructed in a matter of hours or days.
% Aside from time, the largest barrier to custom and
%  ique morph designs is typically cost. Ultimately it is
% e gamemaster’s decision on what expenses such mea-
%  es entail—typically starting at Expensive and moving
%  —or even whether they are possible at all.          ■
% closely monitored and tracked, and the hypercorps are
% not above sending ego hunters to retrieve a runaway.

% PUBLIC RESLEEVING
% Some locales, notably Titan, have a well-developed
% public resleeving infrastructure intended to provide a
% body to anyone who needs one. Morphs provided are
% usually unremarkable cases, synths, or splicers with
% no Positive traits or optional implants. Anyone hold-
% ing citizenship in a locale with public resleeving may
% apply for a body. Wait times are between a month and
% two years, with Reputation influencing wait times at
% the gamemaster’s discretion.

% RENTING MORPHS
% For temporary visits where an infomorph won’t do,
% morphs may be leased rather than bought. The cost
% to rent a morph is 1% of its cost per day, plus a Low
% charge for resleeving. This cost includes rental insur-
% ance (see below). If the rental insurance is waived
% (not always possible unless you have a good Rep), the
% rental cost may be reduced by half.

% Characters who are leasing a morph may also use
% their previous morph as collateral. In this case, deduct
% the cost of the character’s current morph from the
% rental morph before calculating the 1% cost per day,
% with a minimal rental cost of 10 credits per day.

% PENAL LEASE
% Characters visiting the inner system or Jovian
% Republic may be able to lease morphs belonging
% to prisoners. In most jurisdictions, criminals are
% sentenced to terms in rehabilitative simulspace with
% a stipulation that the prisoner’s morph becomes
% state property during their term of incarceration.
% Morphs acquired this way often have complicated
% histories but also tend to have modifications useful
% to Firewall agents. Conversely, characters who find
% themselves imprisoned may be subject to having
% their body leased out during incarceration.

% The effects of taking a penal lease are at the dis-
% cretion of the gamemaster. A character may have
% to pull some strings with their Reputation in order
% to lease such a morph, especially if it has restricted
% or illegal modifi cations. Negative traits, cases of
% mistaken identity, and unfortunate encounters with
% friends and associates of the morph’s former oc-
% cupant are among the possible drawbacks to this
% type of arrangement. On the up side, penal leases
% may reduce costs for both leasing and insuring the
% morph, again subject to the gamemaster’s discretion.

% RENTAL INSURANCE
% Leased morphs must be covered by an insurance
% policy, which often restricts the character from
% breaking the law or taking the morph anywhere
% too dangerous or lawless. Characters may purchase
% hazard insurance that will cover taking the morph
% into certain dangerous situations, but this will
% double the rental price at minimum.

% %%% txt/281.txt

% If a character suffers extensive organic damage or
% death while insured, the insurance will cover 80%
% of the morph’s cost, meaning that the character is
% expected to pay the other 20%. If they cannot pay,
% their possessions or their stored morph may be
% seized in payment.

% If a character violates their insurance policy by
% intentionally putting themself in harm’s way above
% the threat level at which the policy was purchased,
% without first communicating with and rendering pay-
% ment to the insurer, the policy may be declared void.
% If the leased morph dies under a voided policy and
% the character cannot pay to replace it, their posses-
% sions and stored morph may be subject to seizure.

% Seizure takes different forms depending upon the
% local economy and legal system. In hypercorp space,
% it is a straightforward seizure of liquid assets, in-
% cluding forced uploading if the character’s morph is
% seized. Elsewhere, the character is more likely to end
% up owing a lot of favors or taking severe hits to their
% reputation, but they are unlikely to undergo forced
% uploading or outright physical seizure of their morph.



% IDENTITY
% Given the nature of resleeving technologies, identity
% is a fluid concept in Eclipse Phase. Transhumans are
% used to the idea of identifying people by how they
% look or even by their biometric data, but this is no
% longer a certified method. What you look like may
% drastically change from one day to the next. You
% may see an olympian you recognize, but perhaps it’s
% been awhile, so you’re no longer certain that it’s the
% same person still in that morph. If you’re sleeved in a
% popular off-the-rack morph, there may be hundreds
% of other cloned morphs that look exactly like you out
% there—perhaps useful if you desire to blend in. Simi-
% larly, security services can no longer rely on biometric
% technologies. Forensics may be able to identify an indi-
% vidual morph’s presence at a crime scene, but proving
% who was in that morph at the time is another matter.

% Identity is, of course, tied to ego, and various
% authorities have instituted verification and security
% measures based on this. Within the inner system, each
% ego is given an ID number, which is used to validate
% their identity, citizenship, legal status, credit accounts,
% licensing, etc. This ego ID is verifiable by the person’s
% brainwave patterns, which remain the same even
% when resleeving. When an ego uploads, the upload-
% ing service is required to incorporate this ego ID into
% the person’s backup/infomorph. Likewise, when that
% person resleeves, the service handling the procedure
% is required by law to verify the ego’s ID before down-
% loading. The ego ID is then hardcoded into the morph
% itself in the form of a nanotattoo on the tip of the per-
% son’s index finger. This nanotat can be easily scanned
% at security checkpoints to verify identity.

% Though efficient, this system is far from perfect. For
% one, ID record-keeping is far from standardized and
% varies drastically from habitat to habitat. Most do not
% share records with each other unless they are part of the
% same political alliance in order to protect their citizens’
% privacy. For example, Lunar-Lagrange Alliance stations
% do not share citizenship ID data with the Planetary
% Consortium, though they do share with each other.

% On top of this, many identity records were lost
% during the Fall, a situation that was undoubtedly ex-
% ploited by those who preferred to erase their past or
% adopt a new persona. These all make for a situation
% where identity records are patchwork at best. Officials
% must also rely on the security of other habitats for ID
% verification. If a person egocasts to Nectar on Mars
% from Qing Long in the Martian Trojans, and the
% Nectar officials have no record of this person, they
% can only trust that the Qing Long officials did their
% job when verifying the subject’s ID and background.

% To make matters worse, many autonomist habitats
% operate without identity checks altogether. Though
% some ID measures are still used, both to prevent
% reputation system gaming and to be able to identify
% bodies in the case of death, these uses are significantly
% more lax and few records are kept. Therefore, when
% autonomists and the like egocast to habitats that re-
% quire ID, they are assigned a temporary ID for the du-
% ration of their stay (and sometimes any future visits).

% IDENTITY VERIFICATION
% There are three ways to verify someone’s identity:
% nanotat scan, brainwave scan, and checking the cryp-
% tographic hash on a digital mind.

% NANOTAT SCANS
% Special encoded nanobots are used to create a small
% nanotat on a person’s index finger. These nanobots
% contain encoded information that includes their name
% and identity, brainwave pattern, citizenship/legal status,
% credit account number, insurance information, and
% licenses. Depending on the local habitat laws, it may
% include other information such as criminal history,
% travel history, restricted implants, employment records,
% and so on. This nanotat may be read by anyone with
% a special ID scanner that reads the nanobot encoding.

% ID nanotats include information on the company
% that did the resleeving, so that the data may be ac-
% cessed and verified with their records online. The data
% on the nanotat is also cryptographically signed with
% the company’s public key, meaning that anyone who
% checks the data and the signature online can tell if the
% data has been altered.

% BRAINWAVE SCANS
% Brainwave scans are one of the few types of biometric
% prints that stay with an ego no matter what morph it
% is in. They are impractical for most security purposes
% as they require a scan with a combination electroen-
% cephalogram and neuroimaging device, referred to as
% a brainprint scanner, which takes approximately 5
% minutes. This device measures the subject’s baseline
% brainwave pattern as well as the subject’s brainwave
% signature responses when they think certain thoughts

% %%% txt/282.txt
% or sense certain patterns. These scans are all but
% impossible to fool, however, barring hacking of the
% brainprint scanner itself, and so are considered quite
% reliable. For this reason they are occasionally used in
% high-security facilities.

% It is worth noting that infection by some variants
% of the Exsurgent virus, notably the Watts-Macleod
% strain (p. 367), sometimes alters a person’s brainwave
% patterns, but not in every case.

% DIGITAL CODE
% Digital ID codes are often incorporated into backups and
% infomorphs. Not only does this help identify who the
% backup belongs to, but it serves as an electronic signature
% for verifying ID when the backup is to be resleeved. This
% digital code typically contains the same information as
% the nanotat ID, and is signed with a cryptographic hash
% that makes it difficult to forge and which can be verified
% online. AIs and AGIs also feature such built-in codes.

% CIRCUMVENTING ID CHECKS
% Firewall sentinels and clandestine agents often have a
% need to hide or alter their identities. While ID system
% are challenging, they are not insurmountable.

% FAKE IDS
% The easiest way to bypass security checks is to establish
% a fake ID. Given the patchwork nature of identity re-
% cords and the lack of any centralized authority, this is
% not very difficult. Numerous crime syndicates and even
% some autonomist groups maintain a thriving ID fabrica-
% tion business, often with complete histories and medical
% covers for implants that might be restricted or illegal.

% These IDs are usually registered with habitats that are
% either known criminal havens, have autonomist sym-
% pathies, or are isolated and remote. Though the ID is
% actually verifiable and registered with these stations, the
% potential shady origins of such IDs is known to most
% inner system authorities and so the character may be
% exposed to extra scrutiny or monitoring. Fake IDs may
% be acquired that are registered with more respected au-
% thorities, but this often requires a much higher expense
% or connections to hypercorp clandestine operations.

% Black market darkcast and resleeving options offer
% fake IDs as a matter of course.

% ALTERING NANOTAT IDS
% Special nanobot treatments may be manufactured
% to erase, rewrite, or replace nanotat IDs. Erasing a
% nanotat is easy, but not having one is a crime and im-
% mediate grounds for suspicion in many habitats. Re-
% writing a nanotat is also easy, though this means that
% the nanotat will fail its authorization online unless the
% encryption has also been cracked (p. 253). Replacing
% a nanotat ID with a fake one is just as possible, and is
% part of the process of acquiring a fake ID.

% DIGITAL ID TAMPERING
% Digital ID codes may also be tampered with, though like
% nanotat IDs this will mean that the ID fails online verifi-
% cation unless the encryption is also defeated (p. 253).
% LIFE IN SPACE
% Transhumanity is not just a spacefaring race, it is
% also largely space-dwelling. While a substantial por-
% tion of transhumanity inhabits planetary bodies like
% Mars, Luna, Venus, and the moons of the gas giants,
% the balance live in a variety of space habitats, ranging
% from the old-fashioned O’Neill cylinders of the inner
% system to the Cole bubbles of the outer system.

% SPACE HABITATS
% Space habitats come in many sizes and configura-
% tions, from survivalist outposts designed to support
% ten or fewer people to miniature worlds in resource-
% rich areas housing as many as ten million people. In
% heavily settled regions of space, such as Martian orbit,
% habitats may be integrated into local infrastructure,
% relying to some extent on supply shipments from other
% orbital installations.

% More commonly, especially in the outer system,
% habitats are independent entities. This usually means
% that in addition to the main space station, the habitat
% is attended by a host of support structures, including
% zero-g factories, gas and volatiles refineries, foundries,
% defense satellites, and mining bases.

%  Habitats—especially large ones—sometimes have
% visitors, as well. Majors habitats are crossroads in
% space. In addition to scheduled bulk freighter stops,
% they may have hangers-on such as scum barges, pros-
% pectors, or out-of-work autonomous bot swarms.

% Many habitats have some form of transportation
% network. This is most common in large cylindrical
% habitats with centrifugal gravity. Common solutions
% for public transit include monorail trains, trams, and
% dirigible skybuses. Common personal transit options
% included bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, and micro-
% light aircraft, with larger vehicles being uncommon
% and usually reserved for official use.

% Most habitats with large interior spaces also use aug-
% mented reality overlays to create consensual hallucina-
% tions of a sky and clouds, to which most residents keep
% their AR channels tuned. One would think that in space,
% talking about the weather would have disappeared from
% transhumanity’s repertoire of small talk, but the habit
% persists—only the weather discussed is usually virtual (if
% it’s not real “weather”—solar flare activity and the like).

% CLUSTER COLONY
% Clusters are the most common form of microgravity
% habitat. Clusters consist of networks of spherical or
% rectangular modules made of light materials and con-
% nected by floatways. Typically business and residential
% modules are clustered around arterial floatways and in-
% frastructure modules such as farms, power, and waste
% recycling. Limited artificial gravity areas may exists,
% frequently parks or other public places and specialized
% modules like resleeving facilities (morphs often keep
% better when stored in gravity). Arterial floatways in
% large clusters may have “fast lanes” where a constantly
% moving conveyor of grab-loops speeds people along.

% %%% txt/283.txt

% Clusters are most commonly found in volatile-rich env
% like the Trojans and the ring systems of the gas giants (p
% Saturn). Clusters are rare in the Jovian system because
% cluster of individual modules rather than one large sta
% Jupiter’s intense magnetosphere is hideously inefficient.

% Cluster colonies can have anywhere from 50 to 250,000

% COLE BUBBLES
% Cole bubbles (or “bubbleworlds”) are found mostly in
% asteroid belt, where the large nickel-iron asteroids used t
% them are abundant. Bubbleworlds are less common in t
% and Greeks, where crusty ice asteroids predominate. A C
% is similar in many respects to an O’Neill cylinder, but th
% longitudinal windows. Sunlight instead enters through a
% arrays. The bubbleworld is also constructed very differen
% large solar array to heat a pocket of water inside of a met
% so that the metal expands. Rotating the asteroid caus
% leable material to form a cylinder, which is then capped
% water drained. The inside can then be pressurized, bui
% planted. Cole bubbles can also be spun for gravity, accor
% whims of the inhabitants, though the gravity lowers as yo
% poles of the bubble, with zero gravity at the axis of rotat

% Cole bubbles are among the largest structures transhu
% created in space. The largest Cole habitat, Extropia, ha
% tion of 10 million.

% HAMILTON CYLINDERS
% Hamilton cylinders are a new technology. There are only
% operational Hamilton cylinders in the system, but the de
% great promise and is likely to be widely adopted over t
% period. Hamilton cylinders are grown using a comple
% algorithm that orchestrates nanoscale building machi
% nanobots build the habitat slowly over time, a process
% growing than construction.

% Similar to O’Neill cylinders and Cole bubbles, a Ham
% der is a cylindrical habitat rotating on its long axis to pr
% ity. Two of the known Hamilton cylinders orbit Saturn i
% skimming the rings near the Cassini division. From th
% they can graze on silicates and volatiles using harvester s

% None of the currently-operating Hamilton cylinders h
% to full size yet, but estimates say they could each hou
% million people.

% O’NEILL CYLINDERS
% Found mostly in the orbits of Earth, Luna, Venus, and Ma
% cylinders were among transhumanity’s first large space
% signs. O’Neill cylinders are no longer built, having bee
% by more efficient designs, but are still home to tens of
% transhumans. O’Neill cylinders were constructed from me
% on Luna or Mercury, Lunar volatiles (including Lunar
% and asteroidal silicates.

% A typical O’Neill habitat is thirty-five kilometers lon
% lometers in diameter, and rotates around its long axis
% sufficient for centrifugal force to create one Earth grav

% The inside of an O’Neill cylinder has six alternating
% strips of ground and window running from one cap
% of the cylinder to the other. One narrow end of an
% O’Neill cylinder points toward the sun. The opposite
% end is the mooring point for three immense reflectors
% angled to reflect sunlight into the windows. Smart
% materials coating the windows and reflectors prevent
% fluctuations in solar activity from delivering too much
% heat. The air inside the cylinder and its metal super-
% structure provide radiation shielding.

% The land in most O’Neill cylinders is one-third
% agricultural (a combination of food vats and high-
% yield photosynthetic crops), one-third park land, and
% one-third mixed use residential and business. O’Neill
% habitats have a day and night cycle regulated by the
% position of the external mirrors. The business and
% residential sections of the cylinder usually alternate
% with the park land over two of the strips of land;
% cropland usually takes up the third. Bridges cross
% the windows every kilometer or so, linking the land
% strips. The interior climate, the architectural style of
% the structures, and the types of vegetation and fauna
% present vary with the tastes of the habitats’ designers.

% Depending upon size, O’Neill cylinders can house
% from 25,000 to 2 million people.

% TIN CANS
% Antique research stations and survivalist prospector
% outposts often fit this description. Tin can habitats
% are only a few notches up from the early 21st-century
% International Space Station. Tin cans usually consist
% of one or more modules connected to solar panels
% and other utilities by an open truss. Deluxe models
% feature actual floatways or crawlways between
% modules, while barebones setups require a vacsuit or
% vac-resistant morph to go from room to room. Food
% growing capacity is severely limited and there may be
% no farcasters, but fabricators are available, as well as
% mooring for shuttles and perhaps prospecting craft.

% Tin cans rarely house more than 50 people.

% TORUSES
% Interchangeably called toruses, toroids, donuts, and
% wheels, these circular space habitats were a cheap
% alternative to the O’Neill cylinder used for smaller
% installations. Like O’Neill cylinders, toruses are seldom
% constructed anymore, but many are still encountered in
% the inner system, particularly in Earth and Lunar orbit.

% A toroidal habitat looks like a donut 1 kilometer in
% diameter, rotating on great spokes. There is a zero-g
% spaceport at the wheel’s hub. Visitors take a lift down
% one of the spokes to the level of the donut, where
% rotation creates one Earth gravity.

% The plan of toroidal habitats varies greatly, as many
% were designed for specific scientific or military purposes
% and only later taken over as habitats by entrepreneurs
% or squatters. Many have a succession of decks in the
% donut. Most of those designed for long-term self-
% sufficient habitation have smart material-covered glass
% windows for growing plants along much of the inside
% surface of the torus. Toroidal habitats equipped for
% farming normally face the sun in a direction perpen-
% dicular to their rotational axis, but then use a slow pro-
% cessional wobble of that axis to create a day/night cycle.

% Toruses were usually built to accommodate small
% crews of 500 or fewer people, though some larger
% ones exist, able to house 50,000. A few rare double-
% toruses also exist, like two large wheels spinning in
% opposite directions, joined at the axis.

% IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS
% How characters gain entry to a habitat and what type
% of screening they’re likely to undergo depends upon
% how they arrive. Some habitats are close to other
% settlements, while others are physically isolated by the
% vast, empty distances of interplanetary space.

% Habitats in dense planetary systems receive most of
% their visitors via conventional space travel. Immigra-
% tion and customs infrastructure is geared toward re-
% ceiving visitors via their spaceport, and the processing
% of arrivals is in most ways analogous to a twentieth
% century airport. Isolated habitats, on the other hand,
% tend to receive almost all of their visitors via egocast.

% PHYSICAL ARRIVALS
% Arrivals by spacecraft undergo, at minimum, an ego
% ID check, scans to detect pathogens, hostile nanobots,
% explosives, or radiation, and an inspection of their
% personal effects. Some habitats go farther, including
% rigorous secondary screenings using scout nano-
% swarms, scans of all electronic systems for malware,
% and/or aggressive interrogation of a fork of the subject.
% Even autonomist enclaves enforce automated scans for
% anything that might pose a danger to the habitat or
% any signs of hypercorp saboteur efforts.

% Restricted goods vary according to local legalities.
% Many habitats, particularly those controlled by auton-
% omist or criminal factions, allow personal weaponry
% as long as its nothing you can use to blow a hole in
% the structure or indiscriminately kill dozens of people.
% Others, notably the Jovian Republic and hypercorp
% stations, disallow lethal weapons of all kinds, except
% for people who have acquired special permits and au-
% thorization (sometimes available by bribing the right
% people or pulling favors with rep). Nonlethal weapons
% are generally allowed. Other restricted items may
% include nanofabricators, nanoswarms, malware and
% hacker software, drugs and narcoalgorithms, certain
% types of XP recordings, covert operations tools, and
% so on. Certain types of morphs may also be restricted,
% such as reapers, furies, or uplifts.

% Certain habitats may insist that visitors—or at
% least the ones they don’t like the looks of—submit to
% specific forms of monitoring or surveillance for the
% duration of their stay. This might include taggant
% nanoswarms, hosting a police AI in your mesh inserts,
% or even physical tailing by an armed security drone.
% Other stations will require that their visitors leave a
% fork as a form of collateral at the door—in case they
% commit a crime, the fork can be interrogated.

% %%% txt/285.txt

% Finally, though rare, some habitats go so far as to
% charge all visitors an “air tax”—a fee for using the
% station’s publicly available resources while they are
% present. This is generally only common in isolated
% habitats with strained resources, and is considered
% especially obnoxious by most autonomists.

% Some syndicates run a good business in smuggling
% certain goods or even people into habitats. This is gen-
% erally accomplished through bribed security personnel,
% but is also sometimes handled as falsified credentials
% that will allow the subject to breeze past security
% checks. Such services are typically quite expensive.

% For those hoping to gain quiet and unobserved
% access, there is always the option of taking a space-
% walk and trying to break in through an unattended
% airlock. Such attempts are quite often dangerous and
% futile, as most habitats have dedicated sensor and
% security systems to monitor their exterior surface and
% in particular any access points. Still, it is a possibility
% for a resourceful team with a skilled hacker, though
% armed sentry bots are a particular danger.

% ELECTRONIC ARRIVALS
% Arrivals by egocast are sometimes interviewed by
% habitat authorities in a simulspace before resleeving.
% Depending upon the habitat’s attitude toward civil
% rights, this process can be relatively reasonable or
% quite invasive. A minimal entry inspection includes an
% ID check, a brief interview with a customs AI, and a
% review of the specs of the morph into which the ar-
% riving ego plans to resleeve. Habitats with draconian
% immigration measures may use harsh psychosurgery
% interrogation techniques on suspect infomorphs. Ego-
% cast backups have little recourse to avoid this treat-
% ment—station authorities can simply file them away
% in cold storage if they choose—so it is wise to investi-
% gate custom procedures before you send yourself over.

% Because many people, particularly autonomists and
% brinkers, don’t appreciate this kind of reception, vari-
% ous uploading services have stepped in to provide pre-
% customs resleeving for characters traveling to habitats
% with suspect screening methods. For often-exorbitant
% fees, the traveler egocasts into an extraterritorial sub-
% station close to their intended destination, resleeves
% there, and then travels to their destination by rocket.

% Various darkcast services, normally run by estab-
% lished crime syndicates, sometimes offer an alternative
% method of egocasting in and possibly even resleeving.
% Darkcast services are quite expensive, however, and
% the character is at the mercy of the syndicate opera-
% tors. In rare cases, some political factions or even hy-
% percorps might operate their own darkcast systems,
% which a character with good networking skills might
% be able to take advantage of.

% SPACE TRAVEL
% In some circumstances, characters will prefer to travel
% physically through space rather than egocasting. In
% Eclipse Phase, spacecraft are primarily dealt with as a
% setting environment rather than a vehicle/gear to use.
% Spacecraft largely pilot themselves via the onboard AI.
% Though characters can also take over with their Pilot:
% Spacecraft skill, the situation rarely calls for it.

% LOCAL TRAVEL
% In densely inhabited planetary systems such as Mars
% and Saturn, most travel between cities, surface stations,
% and orbital habitats within 200,000 kilometers is by
% small hydrogen-fueled (or sometimes methane-fueled)
% rockets. This form of travel is incredibly cheap, very
% fast, and avoids the occasional personality glitches
% that crop up during egocasting. LOTVs (lander and
% orbital transfer vehicles, p. 348) are commonly used.
% Spacecraft leaving a planetary body need to be able to
% generate enough thrust to escape the gravity well (see
% Escaping Gravity Wells, p. 346).

% DISTANCE TRAVEL
% For distances of 200,000 to 1.5 million kilometers,
% somewhat larger (and more expensive) fusion- and
% plasma-drive craft make regular runs. Nuclear electric
% ion drives were once used on some of these routes,
% but the poor efficiency of these fission systems and the
% need for radioactive heavy metal reaction mass means
% that they are almost never used anymore. Faster anti-
% matter-drive couriers are also commonly used. These
% ships lack the thrust to escape from the gravity wells
% of large planets or moons, so they station themselves
% in orbit and use smaller ships (typically LOTVs) with
% higher thrust to transport people to and from the
% planetary surface.

% For distances beyond 1.5 million kilometers, almost
% everyone uses egocasting

% SPACE TRAVEL BASICS
% Spacecraft use various types of reaction drives (see
% Spacecraft Propulsion, p. 347), meaning that they burn
% fuel (reaction mass) and direct the heated output in
% one direction, which pushes the spacecraft in the oppo-
% site direction. Travel over any major distance typically
% involves a period of high-acceleration burn for several
% hours at the beginning of the flight, where up to half of
% the reaction mass is spent to drive up the craft’s veloc-
% ity. The ship then coasts for the majority of the flight at
% that speed, until it approaches its destination, where it
% flips over and burns an equal amount of reaction mass
% in the opposite direction to decrease velocity.

% Though some craft burn half their reaction mass
% to get up to the best speed possible, this doesn’t leave
% much room for additional maneuvering or emergen-
% cies. Many craft therefore only burn up to a quarter
% or a third of their fuel in initial accelerations, so they
% have some to spare in case they need it. A few tricks
% can be used to save fuel and build speed, such as sling-
% shotting around the gravity wells of larger planets or
% aerobraking in a planet’s upper atmosphere.

% Travel times between locations are constantly
% changing as various bodies move in their orbits
% around the solar system. Within a cluster or planetary
% system, travel takes a matter of hours. Within the

% %%% txt/286.txt
% inner system, travel can take days or weeks. Travel to,
% from, or within the outer system can take much longer,
% and is usually a matter of several months.

% Most ships operate at zero-g, except for a few larger
% craft that are able to spin habitat modules for low
% gravity. Periods of high-acceleration also produce
% temporary gravity in a downward direction, towards
% the burn.

% Space is a valuable commodity on board spacecraft,
% so room is often tight. Sleeping and personal quarters
% are rarely bigger than large closets, just enough room
% for a sleeping bag and personal effects. Depending
% on the size of the craft, there may be a communal
% recreation area. The crew tend to only be busy at the
% beginning and end of a trip, when they must deal with
% acceleration/deceleration and maneuvering around
% other space traffic. The rest of the trip they spend
% dealing with repairs or otherwise killing time, often
% by accessing XP or VR simulations or playing AR
% games. While spacecraft have their own local mesh
% network, they are usually too far to interact with the
% mesh networks of other habitats without significant
% communications lag, so they must make do with
% their own archive of entertainment options. Many
% long-haul ships are crewed by hibernoid morphs, who
% hunker down for a long nap.

% SPACESHIP COMBAT
% Combat in space tends to take place over long dis-
% tances using massive beam weapons, railguns, and
% missiles. It also tends to be nasty, brutish, and short.
% Significant damage to a vessel can cause atmospheric
% decompression, killing any biomorph crew who aren’t
% suited up and strapped down.

% For the most part, it is recommended that space
% combat be treated as a plot device, part of the back-
% ground story that helps create drama and tension,
% rather than an event that characters actively partici-
% pate in. This is not to say the characters cannot play a
% role in the combat, or that their actions will have no
% effect on the outcome. They may become involved in
% damage control, negotiate with hostile forces, repel
% boarders, target weapons with Gunnery skill, stage a
% mutiny, attempt to hack the networks of approach-
% ing vessels, escape out the airlock, hide out while the
% pirates sack the ship, or similar affairs. It is recom-
% mended, however, that gamemasters steer clear of
% space combat situations that could easily lead to the
% whole team dying due to a few bad dice rolls.



% NANOFABRICATION
% In order to create an object in a nanofabricator
% (whether a cornucopia machine, fabber, or maker; see
% p. 327), three things are needed: raw materials, blue-
% prints, and time.

% RAW MATERIALS
% Raw materials are generally easy to acquire, as most
% nanofabricators are equipped with disassembler units
% that will break down just about anything into its con-
% stituent molecules. Feedstock may also be purchased
% (at a cost of Trivial). Many habitats route their recy-
% cling and waste products directly into disassemblers.

% BLUEPRINTS
% Most nanofabricators are pre-loaded with blueprints
% for general purpose items: food, simple clothing, basic
% tools, etc. Blueprints for other goods may be acquired
% in several ways:

%  • They may be purchased online (legally or on the

% black market).
%  • They may be found for free online (see below).
%  • They may be acquired with Rep, following the

% usual rules for social networking (p. 285).
%  • They may stolen (usually by hacking a mesh site

% or a nanofabricator containing such plans).
%  • They may be self-programmed (see below).


% Once the blueprints are acquired, they are simply
% loaded into the nanofabricator.

% OPEN SOURCE BLUEPRINTS
% Blueprints for many goods may be found for free
% online, disseminated by an active open source
% software movement. The availability of such plans
% typically depends on the local mesh. In autonomist
% habitats, a simple Research Test is likely to turn up the
% open source blueprints you need (applying modifiers
% for unusual items). In more restricted habitats, open
% source blueprints may be harder to find, as they will
% be securely hidden from the prying eyes of the authori-
% ties. In this case, the character will need to use their
% Rep to gain access, bribe a local hacker group, or do
% something similar.

% Note that restricted nanofabricators may not accept
% open source blueprints (see Blueprint Restrictions).

% BLUEPRINT RESTRICTIONS
% Some nanofabricators are equipped with pre-pro-
% grammed restrictions not to accept blueprints for re-
% stricted items (such as weapons) or non-licensed items
% (such as black market or open source blueprints).
% These restrictions may be circumvented by hacking
% the nanofabricator and re-programming it, following
% normal hacking rules (p. 254).

% PROGRAMMING BLUEPRINTS
% A dedicated character may simply decide to program
% their own blueprints, though this is a time-consuming
% endeavor. To do so, the character must make a Pro-
% gramming: Nanofabrication Test with a timeframe of
% one week per cost level of the item. For example, a
% Trivial cost item takes 1 week, a Low cost item takes 2
% weeks, a Moderate item 3 weeks, and so on. Academ-
% ics: Nanotechnology skill or a skill appropriate to the
% object’s design may be used as a complementary skill
% (p. 173) for this test. A fork or muse may also be as-
% signed to such a programming task.

% %%% txt/287.txt
% TIME
% Once the raw materials and blueprints are in, most n
% tion is simply a matter of time. The exact timeframe t
% object varies, but roughly approximates 1 hour per cost
% the item (1 hour for Trivial, 2 for Low, 3 for Moderate
% gamemaster may feel free to modify this period as appr
% the object.

% THE PROGRAMMING TEST
% Nanofabrication is typically handled as a Programming
% rication Test. In most cases, this can be treated as a Sim
% Test (p. 118), with a failed roll simply indicating that th
% some minor imperfections, or perhaps took longer to ma

% In some cases, the gamemaster may call for an actual S
% meaning that failure is more of a possibility. This shou
% done for items that are exotic, extremely complicated, o
% the blueprints are incomplete or otherwise suspect. This t
% be made if the raw materials are limited.

% The character operating the nanofabricator can make
% it can be left up to the nanofabricator’s built-in AI. Mos
% AIs have a Programming: Nanofabrication skill of 30 (s
% Muses, p. 331).

% Money is for people who don’t know how to take
% care of themselves. Transhumanity is only a few de-
% cades away from being a mature Type I Kardashev
% civilization, having largely mastered the material
% resources of its own solar system. A character from
% the outer system most likely finds the whole concept
% of money an embarrassment.

% However, material abundance hasn’t eliminated
% the value of certain goods and services. A transhu-
% man’s lunch might be free, but innovative ideas, new
% designs, health care, sex, and dirty work don’t grow
% in fabricators. What if you need gene therapy on your

% How about someone to assassinate your renegade
% beta fork after she set off a hallucinogen grenade at
% your gallery opening and kidnapped your boyfriend?
% What if you really need a spanking? You call on your
% social network. If your network is sufficiently deep
% and numerous, and your reputation is good enough,
% someone will help you out.

% In the inner system, the reputation economy doesn’t
% replace money for the exchange of goods and services,
% but it does hold sway over the network of favors and
% influence. Calling on contacts, getting information,
% and making sure you’re in the best place to see and be
% seen all involve calling on your social network.

% SOCIAL NETWORKS
% Social networks represent the people you know, and
% the people they know, and so on. It starts with your
% friends and family, spreads out to your co-workers,
% neighbors, and colleagues, and expands all the way
% out to your acquaintances, from the neo-hominid
% waitron at your favorite cafe to the sylph you flirt
% with at the club. In the always-online, fully-meshed
% universe of Eclipse Phase, this goes even further,
% encompassing all of the people you’ve linked to via
% social mesh networks, everyone who watches your
% blog/lifelog/updates, and everyone you interact with
% on various mesh forums. Now add in the friend-of-a-
% friend factor, and everyone has an impressive ability
% to reach out to people they know, people they sort of
% know, and people you don’t know but who are some-
% how linked to you in one degree or another.

% Of course, social networks are not homogeneous.
% Among the ever-diversifying ranks of transhumanity,
% there is a tendency to coalesce around various shared
% characteristics, whether those be cultural background,
% personal interests, professional ties, local connections,
% political affiliations, subcultural obsessions, or simply
% common interest from being part of the same sub-
% species clade. The social network of an info-anarchist
% hacker is likely to bear little resemblance to that of
% a hypercorp socialite or an isolate brinker. Neverthe-
% less, social networks quite frequently overlap, often
% in unexpected and interesting ways. Most people can
% be considered members of several different types of
% social networks. This overlap is what links disparate
% groupings of transhumans together.
% NETWORKING
% Just being connected, of course, doesn’t mean you have
% several thousand idle transhumans at your beck and
% call. If you hope to gather the latest gossip, get advice
% from an expert, find someone who can fix your prob-
% lems, acquire a piece of gray market tech, or spread a
% meme, you need to know both who to talk to in that
% social network and how to go about getting what you
% need, especially if you hope to keep things quiet and
% not raise any flags.

% This is where your Networking: [Field] skills come
% in (p. 182). Networking represents your ability to ma-
% neuver through this web of personal and impersonal
% connections to find who and what you need. This
% could be handled by word-of-mouth, posting the right
% queries in the right places on the mesh, monitoring
% the right personal profiles and forums, harnessing the
% power of the mob with crowdsourcing, or any number
% of similar creative tactics.

% Each field you have in Networking represents a
% particular network grouping, a common interest that
% ties people together. Most of these fields are based
% on factions (Autonomists, Hypercorp, etc.) and tie
% into a special reputation network (see the Reputation
% Networks table, p. 287). At the gamemaster’s discre-
% tion, other groupings of people could be connected
% through these skills and rep systems. For example,
% artists and journalists of all stripes can fall under
% the Networking: Media skill and f-rep, no matter if
% they are autonomist or hypercorp. Likewise, being a
% diverse group, brinkers do not universally fall into any
% of the categories, and are instead spread out between
% them. If the gamemaster and players agree, other
% Networking fields and rep networks may be added,
% representing other spheres of interest, such as AR
% Games, Sports, Slash Fiction, etc.

% The exact uses for which you may exploit your social
% networks are noted below. While in some cases the de-
% fining element is who you know and how good you are
% at reaching out to them, in others the defining element
% is how known you are. You might be connected to
% thousands of people, but if you don’t have clout, your
% efforts to make use of these connections is limited. This
% is where Reputation comes into play.

% REPUTATION
% Reputation is a measurement of your social currency.
% In the gift economies of the outer system, social repu-
% tation has effectively replaced money. Unlike credit,
% however, reputation is far more stable.

% Within Eclipse Phase, reputation scores are facili-
% tated by online social networks. Almost everyone is a
% member of one or more of these reputation networks.
% It is a trivial matter to ping the current Rep score and
% history of someone you are dealing with—your muse
% often does this automatically, marking an entoptic
% Rep score badge on anyone with whom you interact,
% updated in real time, so you will see if they suddenly
% take a hit or become popular. The 7 most common
% networks are noted on the Reputation Networks

% %%% txt/289.txt
%  table. Gamemasters and characters may decide to add
%  others appropriate to their game.

% You purchase a Rep score in one or more of these
%  networks during character creation. Rep scores are
%  rated between 0 and 99, just like skills. These ratings
%  determine your ability to acquire goods, services, and
%  information and favors, as noted below. These scores
%  may be raised or lowered during game play according
%  to your character’s actions.

%  USING NETWORKS AND REP
%  In game terms, you take advantage of your connec-
%  tions and personal cred every time you need a favor.
%  A favor is broadly defined as anything you try to get
%  via your social networks, whether that be information,
%  aid, goods, and so on. Different types of favors are
%  described under Favors, p. 289.

%  THE NETWORKING TEST
%  To pursue a favor, you start by looking around. This
%  calls for a Networking Test to determine if you can
%  find the person, people, or information you need.
%  This represents talking to people you know, spread-
%  ing the word to people they know, posting queries to
%  the social network at large, digging through various
%  profiles, chat rooms, etc. to find someone who might
%  help you out, and so on.

%  Networking Tests are subject to modifiers for the
%  level of the favor (see below), the amount the char-
%  acter is trying to keep quiet about the request (see
%  below), and any other factors noted on the Network-
%  ing Modifiers table or determined by the gamemaster.

%  Networking Tests are Task Actions—it takes time
%  to call in favors or track down information. The time-
%  frame depends on the level of favor, as noted on the
%  Favors table, p. 289.

% FAVOR LEVELS AND MODIFIERS

% Rep scores are broken down into five levels, reflecting

% your standing within that community. Every 20 points

% of Rep equals one level. See the Reputation Levels

% table for a breakdown.


% Likewise, favors are also broken down into five

% levels, rated from Trivial to Scarce (see Favors, p. 289,

% for specific examples). The standard level of favor

% you can expect to get from a social network is based

% on your level of Rep in that network. If you want to

% pursue a favor above your level, you can do so, but

% you will suffer a negative modifier on your Network-

% ing Test. This reflects that someone with low standing

% has a hard time getting people to go out of their way

% for them. Similarly, if you pursue a favor below your

% level, you receive a positive modifier to your Network-

% ing Test, reflecting that your prestige makes it easier to

% acquire minor things that you need. For each level the

% favor falls under or above your Rep score level, apply

% a + or –10 modifier, as appropriate.

%       for free. This uses up a High favor, however.


% THE LIMITS OF REPUTATION
% Even in the gift economies, reputation only gets you so
% far. There are limits to how often you can ask for help
% before you start coming across as pushy or a leech. In
% game terms, this is expressed as a refresh rate—the
% amount of time you must wait to pass before you can
% seek out a favor of that level again without seeming
% demanding. Refresh rates are noted on the Favors
% table (p. 289).

% If you need to seek another favor before the refresh
% rate has expired, you have two choices. You can
% expend a higher level favor instead, keeping in mind
% that higher level favors refresh more slowly. Alterna-
% tively, you can burn reputation (see below).




%       Now that Jaqui’s got her weapon, she needs


%       another favor—she needs to find someone who


%       doesn’t want to be found. The person she’s after is


%       scum, so once again she turns to the scum for help.

%       4 favor (see Acquire Information, p. 291). Once

%          Jaqui now has a choice. To get this information,


%       she either needs to pay the person in credits (a


%       High cost) or she she needs to expend another


%       Level 4 favor. She’s low on money, so she decides


%       to use her rep again. Level 4 favors only refresh


%       once a month, though, and Jaqui used her last one


%       just a few hours ago. Her only choice is to expend


%       a higher favor, so she expends a Level 5 to get the


%       intel she needs.
% BURNING REPUTATION
% In some cases, getting what you need may be more
% important than not stepping on people’s tentacles. In
% situations of dire need, you can burn some of your
% Rep score to get the job done, meaning that you ex-
% change a loss of Rep for a shot at a favor. This reflects
% that you are pushing the bounds of how far people are
% willing to go for you. While you still might get what
% you need, your online reputation rating takes a hit as
% people flag you for being needy.

% There are two reasons to burn Rep score. The first
% is to get a bonus on your Networking Test. This indi-
% cates that you are pulling strings and calling in mark-
% ers to get the favor you’re after. This is particularly
% useful when you are trying to obtain a favor that’s of
% a level higher than your Rep, but abuse it too often
% and you will soon have no social standing at all. Every
% point of Rep you burn gives you an equivalent posi-
% tive modifier on the Networking Test, up to a maxi-
% mum of +30.

% The second option is to burn Rep to seek a favor
% before it has refreshed. This reflects that you are asking
% for too much in a short period. The amount of Rep
% you must burn in this case depends on the level of favor
% you are seeking, as noted on the Favors table (p. 289).



% Jaqui’s got her weapon and her target’s where-

% abouts, but she needs one more thing: a hacker.

% She needs someone who can open some doors

% and defeat some security systems so she can get

% to the target she’s after in his hideout. Since she’s

% on a scum barge, Jaqui feels that, once again, her

% best option is to work her scum contacts. The

% gamemaster determines that this will be another

% Level 4 favor. Rolling against a target number of

% 40 again, she gets a 13—her luck is holding.


% She finds a hacker, but now she needs to make

% an exchange for their services. Once again she

% decides not to spend credit and use her @-rep

% instead. Jaqui’s already used up both her Level 4

% and Level 5 @-rep favors, though, so she has no

% choice but to burn reputation. A Level 4 favor costs

% 10 Rep to burn. Jaqui spends it, sending her @-rep

% from 53 to 43—she’s been pulling in a lot of big

% favors in a short amount of time, and her friends

% and acquaintances are expressing their annoyance

% by lowering her social standing.


% KEEPING QUIET
% The problem with using social networks for favors is
% that you end up letting lots of other people know what
% you’re up to. When you’re involved in a clandestine
% operation, that could be exactly what you don’t want.
% The only way to diminish this is to take your requests
% to trusted friends and ask them to keep quiet, but this
% diminishes the pool of people at your disposal.

% %%% txt/291.txt

% In game terms, you can try to keep word of what
%  you’re doing quiet, but this makes it harder to get
%  what you need. For every negative modifier you apply
%  to your Networking Test, the same negative modifier
%  applies to anyone making a Networking Test to find
%  out what you’re up to.




%          Revisiting one of our previous examples, we go


%          back to the point where Jaqui was trying to


%          ascertain someone’s hideout location. Because


%          the person she’s after is scum, they’re on a


%          scum ship, and Jaqui is using her Networking:


%          Autonomist skill to find them, there’s a good


%          chance that if she starts asking around to ev-


%          eryone, word might trickle back to the person


%          she’s after. She doesn’t want them to know


%          she’s on their tail, though, so she decides to

% EXAMPLE






%          make her inquiries more discreet. She applies


%          a –20 modifier to her Networking Test, which


%          lowers her target number from 40 to 20. As


%          noted before, she rolls a 21, which is a fail-


%          ure. She spends a Moxie point to flip the roll,


%          though, making it a 12—a success.


%            Because Jaqui took that –20 hit, represent-


%          ing the fact that she was keeping her research


%          quiet, her target will suffer a –20 modifier


%          when he makes his Networking Test to see if


%          he gets word that someone is asking around


%          about his hideout.


%  FAVORS
%  Creative players can undoubtedly come up with many
%  uses for their social networks, but a few of the more
%  common are detailed here.

% Gamemasters should use their discretion as to how
%  much roleplaying interaction and Networking Tests
%  are included in using a social network. For normal
%  goods, straightforward information queries, or small
%  favors, neither dice rolling nor roleplaying may be re-
%  quired. For major requests, interactions with contacts,
%  and mission assistance, dice rolls and/or roleplaying
%  interaction with contacts from the social network
%  should usually occur. Gamemasters may wish to keep
%  track of the NPC contacts in each character’s social
%  networks and make them recurring characters.

% SECURITY
% Firewall sentinels make a regular habit of being in
% places where they are not supposed to be and bring-
% ing things with them that others would prefer they
% not have. Security has a different character post-Fall
% than in the 21st century. Due to hyper-abundance,
% physical security measures such as locks, doors, and
% walls are less important than in the past to common
% citizens. People don’t worry about theft as much as
% in the past because most items can be replaced by a
% nanofabricator. The items that do tend to engender
% this type of security are irreplaceable or rare items
% such as artifacts of Earth.

% Post-Fall physical security focuses heavily on
% surveillance—identifying intruders and tracking
% them so that they can be interdicted by transhuman
% or robotic defenders. Surveillance is more effec-
% tive than in pre-Fall societies because AIs with
% near-human faculties of pattern recognition and
% indentured infomorphs can be employed to monitor
% surveillance data.

% The emphasis on surveillance results from the ease
% with which most material barriers can be breached
% by high-powered hand weaponry and devices like
% the covert operations tool (p. 315). However, physi-
% cal barriers designed to actively resist intruders by
% healing themselves or attacking tools used to damage
% them are used at key points in secure installations.
% Such barriers are typically very expensive and so are
% used sparingly.

% Transhuman, animal, and infolife defenders are
% cornerstones of most security systems. The avail-
% ability of a huge pool of infomorph labor to guard
% facilities means that someone is always on duty,
% whether as part of the surveillance system or in a
% robotic shell.

% ACCESS CONTROL
% The first step in any security system is simply to enact
% measure to keep unwanted people out. At a basic level
% this involves walls, locks, fencing, defensive landscap-
% ing, security lighting, and entoptic warnings.

% Barriers of different sorts present an obstacle that
% must be cut through or blown apart in order to
% defeat. Barriers are treated just like other inanimate
% objects for purposes of attack sand damage; see Ob-
% jects and Structures, p. 202.

% BUG ZAPPERS
% Bug zappers create minute EMP pulses that are harm-
% less to most electronic equipment and implants but
% wreak havoc on nanobot swarms, microbugs, and
% specks. Bug zappers are generally applied to surfaces,
% and as such they only destroy floating/flying swarms
% or specks if they land. In areas with heavily shielded
% electronics, they may be installed to destroy targets
% in an entire room. A zapper instantly destroys all
% free-crawling or flying nanobots and specks in a room
% when it goes off, but transhuman flesh is sufficient to
% prevent it destroying medichines or other implanted
% nanobots. Infiltrators trying to gather data in areas
% protected by zappers generally resort to going around
% them or trying to plant macroscale devices.

% ELECTRONIC LOCKS
% Electronic locks (e-locks) are commonly used as a
% means of maintaining privacy. They are easy to defeat,
% however, and so are rarely used in very secure areas.
% E-locks have several advantages over old-fashioned
% mechanical locks. Different users can have different
% authentication methods, they can log all events (entry,
% exit, failed authentications), and they can be con-
% nected (usually hardwired but sometimes encrypted
% wireless) to security systems for remote control and
% alarm triggering.

% E-locks use one of several authentication systems,
% or sometimes a combination of systems:

% Biometric: The lock scans one or more of the user’s
% biometric prints. Common biometrics include DNA,
% facial thermographic, fingerprint, gait, hand veins, iris,
% keystroke, odor, palm, retinal, and voice prints.

% Keypad: This is an alphanumeric keypad upon
% which users enter a specific code. Different users can
% have different codes.

% Token: Authorized users must carry some sort of
% physical token that interacts with the lock to open the
% door, such as a keycard, electronic key, etc.

% Wireless Code: Users must emit a cryptographic
% code via near-proximity wireless signal.

% Though various technologies exist to defeat each
% of these systems, there are three methods that work
% against almost all e-locks. The first is use of a covert
% operations tool (p. 315), which infiltrates a lock with
% nanobots that swarm in and engage the electronic
% mechanism. The drawback to using a COT is that its
% use is immediately logged by the e-lock and an alarm
% is triggered. Some e-locks are equipped with guardian
% nanoswarms (p. 329) to defeat COTs, but the COT
% nanobots usually manage to open the lock before the
% guardians eat them.

% The second method is to hack the e-lock. Most
% e-locks are slaved to a security system, so this often
% means intruding into the security system and then
% opening the lock from within. This can be difficult,
% however, especially if the security system is wire-
% lessly isolated or hardwired. The advantage is that,
% if done right, all evidence of the lock being opened
% can be erased.

% The third method is to physically open and ma-
% nipulate the lock. This requires first opening the
% lock’s case and then triggering the lock mechanism
% to open the door. Both of these are handled as
% separate Hardware: Electronics Task Actions with
% a timeframe of 1 minute each. In addition, most e-
% locks have anti-tamper circuits that will set off an
% alarm if the attacker does not achieve an Excellent
% Success when opening the case.

% %%% txt/294.txt
% LOCKBOTS
% The 21st century saw a move from mechanical
% locks to e-locks and other largely electronic locking
% mechanisms. These devices worked well for about
% 50 years, until electronic infi ltration capabilities
% rendered them largely useless. The more recent de-
% velopment of lockbots has more in common with
% their early mechanical forebears. They are unique,
% expensive, artisan items.

% A typical lockbot is heavily integrated with the
% portal and barrier it protects. Lockbots usually
% include an AI or indentured infomorph, self-healing
% materials (treat as a self-healing barrier), and a
% swarm of guardian nanobots (p. 329). A lockbot
% monitors its surroundings and has visual recogni-
% tion software that knows what its users and its keys
% look like (Perception skill 40). Picking a lockbot is
% thus incredibly difficult, because it will shut its ori-
% fice and not accept a key that doesn’t look right or
% that comes from an unrecognized user. Unfamiliar
% nanobots trying to enter the orifice are targeted and
% destroyed by the guardian nanobots. Finally, exter-
% nal tools used to harm the portal or the lock will be
% attacked by fractal appendages extruded from the
% portal surface or the lock itself. These appendages
% have a range of 1 meter, attack with skill of 40, and
% inflict 1d10 +2 DV.

% Lockbots are generally immune to being hacked
% because, for security, they aren’t connected to
% the mesh. If attacked, however, lockbots are pro-
% grammed to send out an alarm signal via the mesh.

% There are several ways to defeat a lockbot. One
% is to get a copy or image of the key and then forge
% a copy (using nanofabrication). Another is to attack
% the lockbot or the portal it guards with so much
% force that the lockbot is unable to repair it (usually
% using ranged weapons, as anything within a meter
% of a lockbot may be counterattacked). A third is to
% somehow image the cavity beyond the lockbot’s ori-
% fice without the imaging device being destroyed and
% to then forge the key. All of these are difficult and
% time-consuming processes.

% Some lockbots have the ability to destroy what
% they’re protecting. For example, lockbots are a
% common protection for the physical interfaces to
% hardwired networks. If the lockbot is compromised,
% it may, as a last resort, destroy the interface it was
% protecting.

% PORTAL DENIAL SYSTEM
% Installed in corridors or doorways, this is essentially
% a laser trap device. When an unauthorized person
% enters the portal denial system’s area, it uses lasers
% to create a grid of plasma channels that are used to
% deliver a powerful electric current to the target. This
% system has both lethal and nonlethal settings.

% Nonlethal: 1d10 DV + shock (p. 204)

% Lethal: 2d10 +5 DV
% SELF-HEALING BARRIERS
% Walls and doors that are able to rapidly repair them-
% selves are sometimes found in high security instal-
% lations. These barriers are made of materials that
% automatically expand to “heal” small holes and that
% are equipped with nanosystems that slowly repair
% larger amounts of damage. The best of these barriers
% do no more than slow down the most determined
% assailants, but in combination with surveillance sys-
% tems they are a nuisance to invaders and can slow
% down attempts to flee the scene.

% Self-healing barriers heal any single source of
% damage that is less than 5 points of damage almost
% immediately, sealing the hole in 1 Action Turn. They
% will also seal the holes infl icted by a covert ops
% tool (p. 315) in the same time period. Additionally,
% these barriers repair larger themselves at the rate of
% 1d10 damage per 2 hours; once all damage is fixed
% any wounds are repaired at the rate of 1 per day.
% Damage of 3 wounds or more may not be repaired
% by self-healing.

% SLIPPERY WALLS
% On planetary surfaces, high walls and fences are still
% common as a first line of defense against interlop-
% ers. Slippery walls are surface treated with the slip
% chemical (p. 323), creating a virtually frictionless
% surface that is exceptionally difficult to climb.

% WIRELESS INHIBITORS
% Wireless inhibitors are simple paint jobs or construc-
% tion materials that block radio signals. They are
% used to create a contained area in which a wireless
% network may operate freely without worry that the
% signals will escape out of the area, where they can
% be intercepted. Wireless inhibitors allow the conve-
% nience of using wireless links within a secure area
% rather than the clumsier hardwired connections. If
% an intruder manages to gain access inside the area,
% however, they can intercept, sniff, and hack wireless
% devices as normal.

% DETECTION AND SURVEILLANCE
% Should security measures fail to keep an intruder
% out, the second step is to detect an interloper and
% track their activity.

% NANOTAGGING
% A lot of post-Fall security centers not around keeping
% people out of private spaces, but tracking them after
% they come and go. What little privacy transhumans
% have, they cherish. Trespassing is a worse offense
% than theft in many places.

% A room protected by a taggant nanoswarm (p. 329)
% usually has two or more hives, one each at floor and
% ceiling level (if in gravity; on the opposite side of the
% room if in microgravity) that generate and recycle
% nanobots. The taggants emerge from one hive, float
% through the room, and then return to the other for
% recharging and reuse. A feed line usually connects the

% %%% txt/295.txt
% hives so that they can share materials and power.

% Anyone passing through the room is likely to be
% dosed with taggant nanobots. Once they lose proxim-
% ity to the rest of the hive, they hide and periodically
% broadcast pulsed transmissions meant to give their po-
% sition to pursuers or investigators. Some may drop off
% in clusters to form a breadcrumb trail to the interloper.

% SENSORS
% Any of the various sensors described in the Gear
% chapter (p. 294) may be deployed within a facility
% to monitor and record the passage of personnel,
% both authorized and not. These sensors are typically
% slaved to the facility’s security network and closely
% monitored by security AIs, meaning they are vulner-
% able to hacking and possibly jamming. A few other
% sensor types deserve mention here:

% Chemical Sniffers: The chem sniffer described on
% p. 311 can also be set to detect the carbon dioxide
% exhaled in transhuman breaths. This is useful for
% detecting intruding biomorphs in areas that are
% abandoned/off-limits.

% Electrical Sensors: Electrical sensors can be set in
% portals to detect a biomorph’s electromagnetic field
% in addition to the electrical fields of synthmorphs.

% Heartbeat Sensors: These sensitive sensors detect
% the vibration caused by transhuman heart beats.
% They can even be used to detect the heartbeats of
% passengers inside a large vehicle.

% Seismic Sensors: Embedded in flooring, these sen-
% sors pick up the pressure and vibration of weight
% and movement.

% WEAPON SCANNERS
% Weapon scanners come in several varieties, includ-
% ing those that look for the rare elements used in
% extremely destructive weapons such as nukes, those
% that attempt to locate personal weaponry, and those
% that look for detection taggants.

% Rare element scanners are nearly flawless and are
% ubiquitous in habitat customs and spaceports. The
% only way to circumvent them is to find an alternate
% route into the protected area.

% Personal weapon scanners can monitor a specific
% area, such as a small room or doorway. They use
% a number of sensing systems to detect and identify
% weapons and other dangerous objects, including
% chemical sniffers and radar/terahertz/infrared/x-ray/
% ultrasound imaging. They can detect the following
% items and substances:

%  • Metal used in kinetic weapons, seekers, and

% flechette weapons
%  • Devices with onboard hives of metallic nano-

% bots (e.g., covert operations tools, spindles)
%  • Magnetic elements in plasma guns and railguns
%  • Propellant from firearms ammunition and seek-

% ers (–30 to conceal)
%  • Chemical fuels used in torch spray weapons

% (–30 to conceal)
%  • All explosives and grenades by their chemical

% particulate emissions (–30 to conceal)
%  • Poisons and bioagents in flechette weapons
%  • Any weapon or device larger than palm size

% (using sound waves and shape recognition)


% Characters trying to sneak weapons and gear past
% personal weapon scanners must make a Palm-
% ing Test (if concealing) or an Infiltration
% Test (if somehow maneuvering around
% without notice). This is opposed by a
% Perception Test from the character or
% AI manning the sensor system.

% WIRELESS SCANNING
% Some high-security areas will in-
% tentionally monitor for wireless
% radio signals originating within
% their area as a way of detect-
% ing intruders by their com-
% munications emissions. These
% signals can even be used to
% track the intruder’s location via
% triangulation and other means
% (see Physical Tracking, p. 251).
% To bypass wireless detection sys-
% tems, covert operatives can use
% line-of-sight laser links (p. 313)
% for communication or touch-based
% skinlinks (p. 309).

% ACTIVE COUNTERMEASURES
% When all else fails, active counter-
% measures may be deployed against
% intruders. While live transhu-
% man guards are sometimes
% used, robotic sentries are more
% common, typically AI-driven
% synthmorphs such as synths,
% slitheroids, arachnoids, or
% reapers, with guardian angels
% (p. 346) providing air support.
% Occasionally AI-operated gun
% emplacements—armored tur-
% rets that pop out of walls and
% ceilings—are also applied. In
% some circumstances, these shells
% are teleoperated or even jammed
% by transhuman security.

% dditional countermeasures brought
% to bear will depend on the facility in
% question. Some sites will engage in active
% jamming, to deny the intruders any com-
% munication. Others will deploy hostile nano-
% swarms and even chemical weapons.

%  The accelerated technological levels of Eclipse Phase
%  enable a number of devices for personal enhancement,
%  survival, and other uses.



%  EQUIPMENT RULES
%  The following rules apply to all technological items in
%  Eclipse Phase.

%  ACQUIRING GEAR
%  During character creation, players purchase gear for
%  their characters using the credits they have during
%  the character creation process. Once play begins,
%  however, characters must obtain any equipment they
%  need the usual way: by buying, borrowing, making,
%  or stealing it.

%  In the inner system, hypercorp, and Jovian Republic
%  settlements—and other places where capitalism still
%  reigns—gear acquisition is simply a matter of finding
%  a seller and buying it. Each item has a listed cost, from
%  Trivial to Expensive, as noted on the Gear Costs table.
%  Due to local availability of resources, supply and
%  demand, and legalities, these listed costs are meant
%  to be approximations. When no other factors apply,
%  the listed Average Cost for that category can be used.
%  Otherwise the gamemaster should modify the item’s
%  worth as they see fit, according to local economic fac-
%  tors, while still keeping it within that cost category
%  range. The Cost Modifiers table lists out some sug-
%  gested changes to an item’s cost, but these are simply
%  recommendations, and can be ignored or followed as
%  the gamemaster deems fit. The exact local conditions
%  are largely up to the gamemaster to determine, as best
%  fits their game.

%  In some circumstances, characters may attempt to
%  haggle over gear prices. This is best handled as ro-
%  leplaying, but the gamemaster may also call for an
%  Opposed Persuasion Test (or possibly an Intimidation
%  Test). The character who wins may increase or reduce
%  the price by 10% per 10 points of MoS.

%  In the outer system, anarchist, Titanian, scum, and
%  other habitats that use the reputation economy, charac-
%  ters must rely on their rep scores to acquire the goods
%  and services they need. The mechanics for this are cov-
%  ered under Reputation and Social Networks, p. 285.

%  Characters are of course free to get their hands
%  on equipment by any other means they devise—con
%  schemes, borrowing from friends, and outright
%  theft, with all of the appropriate tests and conse-
%  quences. In some cases, acquiring gear may be an
%  adventure unto itself.

%  FABRICATING GEAR
%  Thanks to nanofabrication technology, characters may
%  also create their own equipment using cornucopia

% machines and similar nanofab devices (p. 327). The

% character must have the appropriate blueprints to do

% so, whether they come with the fabber, are bought

% legitimately or on the black market, acquired with rep,

% or found online. Characters may also code their own

% blueprint desires, using the Programming: Nanofab-

% rication skill.


% GEAR MODIFIERS

% In the technological future, gear is a necessity. In many

% cases, use of equipment provides no bonuses, it simply

% allows a character to perform a task they would oth-

% erwise be unable to do. For example, it is impossible

% to pick a mechanical lock without lockpick or some

% sort of tool.


% In other cases, however, gear provides a bonus to

% the task at hand. Climbing a wall may be possible

% without tools, but if you happen to have gecko gloves

% or other climbing gear, it’s going to be a lot easier. The

% specific modifier applied is usually noted in the gear

% item’s description, typically ranging from +10 to +30.


% GEAR QUALITY

% In both of the situations above, it is possible to have

% items that are of either exceptional or inferior quality,

% with corresponding positive or negative modifiers. The

% gear may be well-crafted, state-of-the-art, cutting-edge

% experimental, or simply top-of-the-line, applying an

% additional +10 to +30. Or it may be outdated, shoddy,

% or in disrepair, inflicting a –10 to –30 modifier (in

% some cases canceling out the basic gear bonus).





%                   GEAR COSTS
%  CATEGORY RANGE (IN CREDITS)          AVERAGE (IN CREDITS)
%  Trivial        1–99                  50
%  Low            100–499               250
%  Moderate       500–1,499             1,000
%  High           1,500–9,999           5,000
%  Expensive      10,000+               20,000

% %%% txt/299.txt
% GEAR SIZES
% On occasion, you’ll need to know how small or large
% a certain piece of equipment is. Though this is largely
% something the gamemaster can wing on the fly using
% common sense, we’ve listed sizes for many gear items
% that are unusual or so futuristic that the average player
% may not have a feel for what dimensions the tech
% likely is. These size categories are listed on the Gear
% Sizes table (p. 297). These sizes should be considered
% approximations, as depending on the manufacturer
% and process, some items may be smaller or larger than
% similar items. It is also important to keep in mind that
% as technology advances, the size and components of
% various equipment items shrink, so when in doubt, go
% with smaller.

% MASS AND ENCUMBRANCE
% A character who is carrying too much gear should
% be slowed down, suffering negative modifiers both
% to their movement rates and their skill tests. Rather
% than micromanaging the weights of individual pieces
% of equipment, however, this matter is largely left to
% the gamemaster’s discretion, using common sense. If a
% character loads up beyond reason, apply modifiers as
% seem appropriate. The gamemaster should, however,
% keep in mind that many of the manufacturing mate-
% rials used in Eclipse Phase allow for items that are
% much lighter than current standards without any loss
% of durability or function (see Future Materials, p. 298).
% Likewise, characters in low or microgravity environ-
% ments can carry much larger loads.

% CONCEALING GEAR
% Characters may attempt to conceal items on their
% person, hoping at least to hide them from casual
% notice if not an intensive search. To determine how

% may wish to roll this secretly). Whenever another
% character has a chance to notice the concealed item,
% they must succeed in a Perception Test and achieve
% a higher MoS than was scored on the Palming Test.
% The gamemaster should apply modifiers to both tests
% as appropriate. For example, concealing a large item
% like a sword would be difficult (–30), whereas wearing
% concealing clothing like a longcoat or multi-pocketed
% jumpsuit would help (+20). Likewise, a character
% who is not actively looking is less likely to notice the
% hidden gear (–30), whereas someone who conducts a
% physical search (+30) or who has enhanced vision to
% pierce protective layers will fare better.

% DESIGN AND FASHION
% Many objects in Eclipse Phase closely resemble their
% early 21st century equivalents—a bottle of soda is still
% a transparent container holding a brightly colored
% liquid, clothing is obviously something you wear, and
% a knife still consists of a blade and a handle. The ma-
% terials, processes, and mindsets that go into making
% them, however, are quite different. To start, very few
% items look have a uniform, mass-produced look, even
% if they were. The procedures of minifacturing and
% nanofabrication allow every individual item to be
% manufactured with a unique (or at least different)
% look. In areas with anarchist/reputation economies, in
% fact, where personal possessions have very little intrin-
% sic value, expression and creativity are favored and so
% many items are artistically personalized (and actual
% hand-crafted items are rare and prized). Likewise,
% almost all equipment is designed with ergonomics
% and ease-of-use prioritized, so gear with soft curves,
% pleasing colors, and form-fitting shapes are common.
% Many items of personal technology, such as flashlights
% or small tools, are made in the form of ovoids that
% fit comfortably in the user’s hand or in similar forms
% that can be easily worn or attached to clothing. To
% someone from the 20th century, many common
% devices look like oddly colored rocks or decorative
% pieces of plastic or ceramic (in fact, many such items
% are referred to as “blobjects” by older transhumans).

% The materials used to create everyday items are
% also advanced, ranging from aerogel and graphene
% to smart materials (p. 298) and exotic metamateri-
% als with unusual physical properties. In practice, this
% means that most items are light, durable (with both
% tensile strength and/or flexibility, as needed), water-
% proof, dirt-repellent, and self-cleaning. Most gear is
% also designed with zero-G or microgravity function-
% ality in mind, and can easily be clipped, tethered, or
% stuck to a surface with grip pads.

% Almost all gear available in Eclipse Phase is also
% available in forms that are wearable/usable by up-
% lifted animals and non-humanoid morphs, such
% as novacrabs, slitheroids, and so on. Even if such
% customized gear is not immediately available, it is

% %%% txt/300.txt
% FUTURE MATERIALS
% Many materials are available and commonly used in
% Eclipse Phase that are rare, theorized, or unheard-
% of today. The following entries note some of the
% more interesting.

% AEROGEL
% Low-density, solid-state “Frozen smoke” is made by
% carefully foaming various materials, typically glasses
% or ceramics, to an ultra-low density state. Aerogel
% is semi-transparent and light-weight, feels like sty-
% rofoam, but acts as an incredible insulator against
% heat and cold. It is commonly used in habitats.

% DIAMOND
% Artificial diamond is lightweight and super-strong,
% has an extremely high melting point, and has near-
% perfect thermal conductivity. This makes it an ideal
% substance for hardening coated surfaces (armor)
% and creating super-tough diamond machinery.

% FULLERENES/FULLERITES
% Fullerenes are molecular carbon structures (known
% as buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, and graphene)
% that are extremely strong (vastly stronger by weight
% than steel), heat-resistant, and can be either insula-
% tive or superconductive. This makes them useful in
% equipment as diverse as armor, electronics, sensor
% systems, or the cables of space elevators.

% METALLIC FOAM
% Metal foam is created by adding foaming agents
% to liquid metals, resulting in extremely lightweight




% usually not difficult to nanofabricate. Smart materials
% (p. 298) also make interoperability between different
% morphs easy.

%  INTERFACE
% It is not uncommon for everyday devices to have no
% visible controls as they are designed to be operated via
% radio broadcasts from the user’s ecto or mesh inserts.
% Any items crafted for use in emergency, combat, sur-
% vival, or exploration situations, however, will feature
% basic physical controls, just in case. Physical interfaces
% are typically controlled by touch pads that are noth-
% ing more than colored spots on the device’s surface,
% though some may also project a holographic interface
% display. Most equipment of this sort can can also be
% voice-activated and controlled.

% Almost all devices are loaded with a complete set
% of help files and tutorials. Most electronics are also
% mesh-capable and equipped with specialized AIs (see
% Meshed Gear, next page).
%  etallic structures—light enough to float on water.
%  eal for habitat construction and floating cities.

% METALLIC GLASS
%  etallic glass are metals highly alloyed to possess a
%  sordered (rather than crystalline) atomic structure
%  ith unique combinations of stiffness and strength,
%  aking it a good wear surface and alternative to
% eramics in armor. It is also useful for its unusual
% or a metal) electrical resistance properties.

% METAMATERIALS
%  etamaterials have unusual physical properties
%  sually electromagnetic) due to their structure,
% uch as having a negative refractive index. Metama-
%  rials are used to create invisibility cloaks (p. 316),
% uperlenses, phased array optics, and impressive
%  D holograms.

%  EFRACTORY METALS
% hese metallic alloys have extremely high melt-
%  g points, making them ideal for extremely hot
% ngine systems, atmospheric entry vehicles, and
% ypersonic craft.

% RANSPARENT ALUMINA
%  transparent form, this ceramic is often known as
%  pphire. Transparent alumina is harder than steel
% nd zero-g casting techniques allow for intriguing
% ansparent construction designs, so long as its poor
%  nsile strength is respected.                    ■





% SMART MATERIALS

% Many common items of technology are made from

% so-called smart materials. These devices contain—or

% sometimes consist entirely of—many small nanoma-

% chines that can both move and reshape themselves

% to alter the object’s shape, color, and texture. For

% example, smart clothing can transform from a suit of

% specialized cold weather clothing suitable for the Mar-

% tian poles in winter to a fashionable suit in the latest

% style due to hundreds of thousands of tiny nanoma-

% chines in the clothing that shift and move to reshape

% the garment. Similarly, a tool made of smart materials

% can switch from a powered screwdriver to a wrench

% or a hammer, as the nanomachines move around and

% completely reshape the tool. Smart materials all con-

% tain specialized advanced nanomachine generators (p.

% 328) that keep them in perfect repair as long as they

% are regularly recharged.

% %%% txt/301.txt
%  MESHED GEAR
% Almost all technology in Eclipse Phase is designed
% to be operated via radio signals from the user’s basic
% implant, although models usable by characters with-
% out basic implants are also available. In addition all
% devices contain a nearly microscopic computer and
% radio link (known as a “voice”) that allows the user to
% easily locate the object and that reports on the condi-
% tion of the object or device, how to properly use and
% care for it, as well as telling the user when it needs
% to be repaired and how. Most are discrete and highly
% useful, but cheaply made goods sometimes have overly
% annoying voices.

% This means that almost all devices can be accessed
% via the mesh or directly if within radio range. This
% makes them vulnerable to hacking and intrusion at-
% tempts (p. 254) as well as radio jamming (p. 262).
% Many devices are, however, publicly accessible (see
% Spimes, p. 238). Meshed gear may also be tracked
% through the mesh (p. 251). For privacy and security,
% these devices are often slaved to other systems (see
% Slaving Devices, p. 248); devices worn/carried by

% characters are usually made part of the personal area

% network and slaved to the character’s mesh inserts/

% ecto. For more info on meshed devices, see the Mesh

% chapter, p. 234.


% Many devices come equipped with AIs, who are

% equipped with skillsofts that enable them to oper-

% ate the device on their own, as according to voiced

% instructions or commands issued through the net. AIs

% are described on p. 264 and p. 331.


% RADIO AND SENSOR RANGES

% In Eclipse Phase, almost all devices are equipped with

% small radios so that they may be meshed. Likewise,

% many pieces of gear are equipped with sensors such as

% cameras, microphones, or other detectors. The Radio

% and Sensor Ranges table notes what range these de-

% vices operate at.


% POWER

% All of the powered devices in Eclipse Phase require

% electricity to function. With rare exceptions, most of

% them rely on either solar cells or powerful batteries.

% These batteries are high-density, room-temperature

% best batteries in common use in the early 21st century.
% Such batteries may also be constructed so that they
% are flexible, printed on devices, or woven into fabric.
% They are good for 100–500 hours of use, and will alert
% the user when they start running low. More power-
% ful radio-isotope nuclear batteries are also available,
% heavily shielded so they do not emit radiation and
% good for 3 years or more of use.

% In short, power should rarely be an issue in Eclipse
% Phase games, unless it happens to fit the plot. Power
% failure could also result from a critical failure roll.



% PERSONAL AUGMENTATION
% Almost all citizens of the solar system, whether human,
% AI, or uplifted animal, use various forms of biological,
% cybernetic, or nanotechnological augmentation. The
% following is a list of the most common types.

% Unless otherwise noted, any bonuses from personal
% augmentations are both compatible and cumulative
% with bonuses from other enhancements.

% STANDARD AUGMENTATIONS
% Most morphs produced in the solar system include the
% following augmentations.

% BASIC BIOMODS
% Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not
% allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph
% does not possess these biomods in order to preserve
% public health. Basic biomods consists of a series of
% genetic tweaks, tailored virii, and bacteria that speed
% healing, greatly increase disease resistance, and impede
% aging. A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast
% as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost
% body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from
% cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In
% addition, the morph requires no more than 3-4 hours
% of sleep per night, is immune to ill-effects from long-
% term exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not
% naturally suffer from biological problems like depres-
% sion, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies.
% [Moderate, but included for free in most biomorphs]

% BASIC MESH INSERTS
% Mesh inserts are ubiquitous among modern morphs.
% This network of cybernetic brain implants is essential
% equipment for anyone who wants to stay connected
% and make full use of the wireless mesh. The intercon-
% nected components of this system include:

%  • Cranial Computer: This computer serves as the

% hub for the character’s personal area network

% and is home to their muse (p. 264). It has all of

% the functions of a smartphone and PDA, acting

% as a media player, meshbrowser, alarm clock/

% calendar, positioning and map system, address

% book, advanced calculator, file storage system,

% search engine, social networking client, messaging

% program, and note pad. It manages the user’s aug-

% mented reality input and can run any software the

% character desires (see Software, p. 331). It also

% processes XP data, allowing the user to experi-

% ence other people’s recorded memories, and also

% allowing the user to share their own XP sensory

% input with others in real-time. Facial/image rec-

% ognition and encryption software (p. 331) are

% included by default.
%  • Radio Transceiver: This transceiver connects the

% user to the mesh and other characters/devices

% within range. It has an effective range of 20 kilo-

% meters in deep space or other locations far from

% radio interference and 1 kilometer in crowded

% habitats.
%  • Medical Sensors: This array of implants monitors

% the user’s medical status, including heart rate,

% respiration, blood pressure, temperature, neural

% activity, and much more. A sophisticated medical

% diagnostic system interprets the data and warns

% the user of any concerns or dangers.


% Using any of these functions is as easy as thinking.
% [Moderate, but included for free in most morphs]

% CORTICAL STACK
% A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit
% protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a
% grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the
% brain stem and spinal cord connect. It contains a
% digital backup of that character’s ego. Part nanoware,
% the implant maintains a network of nanobots that
% monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture,
% noting any changes and updating the ego backup in
% real time, right up to the moment of death. If the char-
% acter dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they
% may be restored from the backup (see Resleeving, p.
% 271). Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless
% access (for security), they must be surgically removed
% (see Retrieving a Cortical Stack, p. 268). Cortical
% stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort
% to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered
% from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or man-
% gled. Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from
% mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure
% to prevent hacking or external tampering. [Moderate,
% but included for free with most morphs]

% CYBERBRAIN
% Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling
% AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods. Modeled on
% biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architec-
% ture and serve as the command node and central pro-
% cessing point for sensory input and decision-making.
% Only one ego or AI may “inhabit” a cyberbrain at a
% time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts (p. 300)
% or a ghost-rider module (p. 307) must be used. Since
% cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the
% equivalent of mnemonic augmentation (p. 307). They
% also have a built-in puppet sock (p. 307) so that they

% %%% txt/303.txt
% may be remote-controlled. Cyberbrains are vulnerable
% to brainhacking (p. 261) and other forms of electronic
% infiltration/attack. Cyberbrains come equipped with
% two or more pairs of external access jacks (p. 306),
% usually located at the base of the skull, which allow
% for direct wired connections. [Moderate, but included
% for free in all synthetic morphs and pods]

% BIOWARE
% Bioware augmentations can be acquired either as a
% genemod when the morph is designed and grown or
% as a later modification to an existing morph, either
% by using nanomachines to modify the morph’s tissue
% or by externally growing the organ and implanting it.
% Bioware may be used to enhance biomorphs (includ-
% ing pods and uplifts), but not synthmorphs.

% ENHANCED SENSES
% The following are a list of the most common enhanced
% senses. Each is also available as a cybernetic implant,
% but bioware is much more common.

% Direction Sense: The character has an innate sense
% of direction and distance using advanced inertial
% navigation. The character can arbitrarily define any
% point as “north” and keep track of which direction
% that is, as well as knowing approximately how far
% they have come. Characters with this augmentation
% can always retrace any route they have taken, only
% experiencing difficulty with three-dimensional routes
% lacking navigational markers (such as deep space or
% undersea; apply a –30 modifier). Since positioning
% inside habitats by anyone with basic mesh inserts is an
% automatic affair, only characters venturing to remote
% locations require this augmentation. [Low]

% Echolocation: The character possesses sonar similar
% to that of a bat or dolphin. The character bounces
% brief ultrasonic pulses off their surroundings and uses
% them to form an image of these surroundings through
% the pattern of reflections of these pulses received by
% the character’s ears. For more details, see Using En-
% hanced Senses, p. 302. This augmentation works in
% both air and water and has a range of 20 meters in air
% and 100 meters in water. [Low]

% Enhanced Hearing: The morph’s ears are enhanced
% to hear both higher and lower frequency sounds—the
% range of sounds they can hear is twice that of normal
% human ears (see Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302). In
% addition, their hearing is considerably more sensitive,
% allowing them to hear sounds as if they were five
% times closer than they are. A character with this aug-
% mentation can easily overhear even a softly spoken
% conversation at another table in a small restaurant.
% This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all
% Perception Tests involving hearing. [Low]

% Enhanced Smell: The morph’s sense of smell is
% equal to that of a bloodhound. The user can iden-
% tify both chemicals and individuals by smell, and can
% track people and chemically reactive objects by smell
% as long as the trail was made within the last several
% hours and has not been obscured. The character can
% also gain a general sense of the emotions and health
% of any character within 5 meters (+20 to Perception or
% Kinesics Tests to do so). [Low]

% Enhanced Vision: The morph’s eyes have tetrachro-
% matic vision capable of exceptional color differen-
% tiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic
% spectrum from terahertz wave frequencies to gamma
% rays, enabling them to see a total of several dozen
% colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes can
% perceive. In addition, these eyes have a variable focus
% equivalent to 5 power magnifiers or binoculars. This
% augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Percep-
% tion Tests involving vision. For further applications,
% see Using Enhances Senses, p. 302. [Low]

% MENTAL AUGMENTATIONS
% Mental augmentations are extremely common.

% Eidetic Memory: The character can remember ev-
% erything that ever happened to them, in detail, with
% no long term memory loss. For example, they can
% recite a page they read in a book a month ago, recall
% a string of 200 random characters they viewed a year
% ago, or even tell you what they had for breakfast on
% a particular date a decade ago. However, they can
% only remember things they paid attention to. The
% character will not remember the contents of a note
% on someone’s desk if they merely glanced at it; they
% must specifically have read it. No effort is required to
% use this augmentation, the character merely needs to
% attempt to remember a specific fact. [Low]

% Hyper Linguist: The morph’s brain maintains the
% linguistic flexibility of a small child, allowing the
% character to learn languages with great ease. This
% functions as the Hyper Linguist trait, p. 146. [Low]

% Math Boost: This implants functions as the Math
% Wiz trait, p. 146. [Low]

% Multiple Personalities: The character’s brain is in-
% tentionally partitioned to accommodate an extra per-
% sonality. This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder,
% but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their
% hypercomplex environments. This extra personality
% can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate
% character (in ego form only) made by the player, or
% the downloaded fork of another character. For all in-
% tents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as
% a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that
% both personalities are backed up in the same cortical
% stack and if downloaded they must be placed in sepa-
% rate morphs or in another morph with this implant.

% Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a
% time. The other resides in the background, still active,
% but not on a surface level. Each ego is completely
% aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc. If for
% some reason the subsumed personality wants to come
% to the fore, but the other personality won’t relinquish
% control, make an Opposed WIL x 3 Test. Each ego
% has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they
% track stress and trauma separately. Any psi attacks or
% social/mental influences only affect the personality at
% the fore.

% USING ENHANCED SENSE
% Personal augmentations and technological aids
% have drastically increased the sensory capabilities
% of most transhumans. The following notes provide
% some details on what capabilities these sensory func-
% tions provide. The capabilities are typically the same
% whether it’s a biological sense or a technological
% sensor, though tech sensors can “turn off” certain
% wavelengths and sense only specific frequencies,
% whereas biological senses perceive the full spectrum
% with no ability to filter parts out.

% SENSORY DATABASES
%  Both technological sensors and enhanced biological
%  senses come equipped with databases of scanned
% “signatures” that make it easier to identify whatever
%  the user is sensing (in the case of bioware, these da-
%  tabases are stored and accessed via the character’s
%  mesh inserts). For example, infrared sensors feature
%  databases listing the heat signatures of different
%  animals and items, making it easier to identify such
%  things. In relevant situations, apply a +20 modifier
%  for identifying targets sensed this way.

% ACTIVE VS. PASSIVE
% An active scanner must actually emit its particular
% frequency and then measure the reflections; this
% means a similar sensor can detect it and home in on
% the emitting source. For example, a character with
% enhanced vision can literally see the terahertz radia-
% tion emitted by someone using an active terahertz
% sensor, much like someone with normal vision can
% see the light emitted by a flashlight.

% A passive scanner simply scans frequencies that occur
% naturally—there is nothing to give the sensor away.

% ELECTROMAGNETIC
% SPECTRUM

% For Eclipse Phase rules purposes, the EM spectrum
% is broken down by wavelength and frequency into
% these categories: radio, microwave, terahertz, infrared,





%  Having an extra ego in your head, working in the

% background, is helpful for multitasking. The character

% receives an extra Complex Action each turn that may

% only be used for mental or mesh actions. [High]


% PHYSICAL AUGMENTATIONS

% Most physical bioware augmentations are derived

% from the capabilities of animals.


% Adrenal Boost: This adrenal gland enhancement

% supercharges the character’s adrenal response to

% situations that invoke stress, pain, or strong emotions

% (fear, anger, lust, hate). When activated, the concen-

% trated burst of norepinephrine accelerates heart rate

% and blood flow and burns carbohydrates. In game

% ible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
%  Radar (Radio/Microwave): Radar sensors work by
%  tively emitting radio waves and microwaves and
%  easuring them as they bounce off the target. Radar
%  orks best when detecting metallic objects, and is
%  ss effective (–20 modifier) against biomorphs and
% mall items. Resolution is not high, however, so it can
%  e shapes but not colors or fine details. It can be
%  ed to detect both speed and movement, can “see”
%  rough walls (up to a cumulative Armor + Durabil-

%  of 100), and can detect cybernetic implants or

% ncealed items. At close ranges (1-2 meters), it can

% tect pulse rate and respiration by measuring the
%  otion of the chest cavity.
%  Terahertz: Terahertz sensors emit t-rays, measure
%  e reflections, and compare them to a database

% terahertz signatures that different items/materi-
%  s have. The resolution is higher than radar, but

% th slightly less detail than normal vision. Similar

% radar, terahertz sensors can see through walls

% d other materials, but to a lesser extent (up to a

% mulative Armor + Durability of 50). T-rays occur

% turally, but terahertz sensors normally require an
% mitter as they are absorbed by atmosphere (as well

% water and metal). In space, however, an emitter
%  ould not be required. Likewise, passive terahertz
%  ans within atmosphere have an effective range of

% meters. T-rays do not penetrate skin, so are inef-
%  ctive for locating implants.
%  Infrared: Near-infrared wavelengths are used
%  r night vision, providing resolution and detail

% uivalent to regular vision under low-light condi-
% ons. Mid-long infrared is excellent for detecting

% at sources (unobstructed by fog or smoke) and
%  mperature differences (as small as 0.1 degree C),

% d such thermal imaging will sense the dissipat-
%  g heat traces left by warm sources on colder ones,

% owing the user to see where someone was sitting,
% ace fading heat footprints, or see what buttons
%  ere pressed if they are quick enough. Infrared





% terms, this allows the character to ignore the –10

% modifier from 1 wound and temporarily increases

% REF by +10 (also boosting REF-linked skills and

% Initiative). These modifiers apply until the character

% has calmed down (if the character also has endocrine

% control, p. 304, then adrenal boosts can be activated

% and deactivated at will, and the negated wounds are

% cumulative). [High]


%  Bioweave Armor (Light): Bioweave armor involves

% lacing the morph’s skin with artificial spider silk bio-

% logical fibers. This provides an Armor rating of 2/3

% without changing the appearance, texture, or sensitiv-

% ity of the morph’s skin. This armor is cumulative with

% worn armor. [Low]

% %%% txt/305.txt

% USING ENHANCED SEN

% also detects the blood flow in a biomorph’s face

% which can be useful in judging emotional states

% (+20 modifier to Kinesics Tests), and can spot sub

% surface implants. Some normally white surfaces

% are reflective (mirrored) in infrared, potentially

% allowing an infrared viewer to see around corners

% or behind themselves. On the other hand, some

% glass is opaque to infrared light. Infrared is also

% useful for determining chemical composition

% (enabling Chemistry Tests by sight alone). Infrared

% sensory input is passive.


% Lidar (Visible Light): Similar to radar, but with

% much higher resolution, lidar actively bounces light

% from the infrared through ultraviolet spectrum off

% a target and measures the backscatter, fluorescence

% and other properties. Lidar is very useful for detect-

% ing atmospheric chemical properties and weather.

% Like radar, it can be used to measure a target’s

% range and speed, or develop a three-dimensional

% image. One clever use of lidar is to precisely “map”

% the position of everything in a room (taking several

% turns of scanning) and then check that positioning

% later to see if anything has been moved.


% Ultraviolet: Some objects are fluorescent in ultra

% violet light, including some animals, flowers, insects

% urine, and minerals (which show up much better

% in ultraviolet than regular light). Some plants and

% animals have patterns that can only be seen in ultra-

% violet. Likewise, chemical dyes that only show up

% under ultraviolet, or that make certain substances

% (like blood) fluoresce under ultraviolet light, have

% various security purposes. Some glass is opaque at

% ultraviolet wavelengths.


% X-Ray/Gamma-Ray: Backscatter imaging systems

% using X- and gamma-ray frequencies produce

% high-resolution three-dimensional images and

% are very useful for detecting concealed weapons

% and implants. Such imagers are very good at

% penetrating walls and metal (up to a cumulative

% Armor + Durability of 200, at least at levels safe





% Bioweave Armor (Heavy): Heavy bioweave armor
% involves lacing the morph’s skin with a denser and
% thicker network of the same fi bers. The morph’s
% skin becomes thicker and somewhat less fl exible
% except at the joints. The morph’s skin also has an
% unusually smooth look, and a distinctively smooth
% and tough-feeling texture. This provides an Armor
% rating of 3/4 without decreasing the morph’s mo-
% bility. The character’s sense of touch, however, is
% significantly reduced (–20 modifier) except on their
% hands, feet, and face. This armor is cumulative with
% worn armor. [Moderate]

% Carapace Armor: Carapace armor combines
% bioweave armor with hard but flexible plates of
% ES (CONT.)
%  o transhumans). These sensors can, of course, also
% detect the presence of harmful radiation.

% SOUNDWAVES
%  he transmission of vibrations through a medium,
%  ound is broken down into infrasound (frequen-

% ies below standard human hearing), normal

% coustic range, and ultrasound (frequencies above
%  tandard human hearing). Soundwaves do not
% propagate in vacuum.

% Ultrasound: Ultrasound sonar operates much
%  ike radar, bouncing sound waves off a target

% nd measuring the returning echoes. Ultrasound
%  maging is similarly low-resolution, showing
%  hapes and movement but no colors and few
% details unless measured closely (1-2 meters).
% Ultrasound is good for identifying how dense a
% material is, however, can detect denser materials
% hidden beneath less dense ones. Many medical
% devices utilize ultrasound, and ultrasound sensors

% an also detect gas leaks, frictional motor noises,

% nd similar mechanical emissions. Ultrasound sen-
%  ors are typically unaffected by noise clutter from
%  tandard acoustic frequencies.

% Infrasound: Infrasound travels much further
%  han regular sound frequencies (hundreds of
% kilometers). Mechanical machinery, seismic distur-
% bances, tornados, explosions, waterfalls, and cer-
%  ain weather phenomena create infrasound waves.

% arge animals such as elephants and whales use
%  nfrasound to communicate via the ground over
% arge distances, though infrasound data transfer is
%  oo slow for complex communications.

% COMBINED SENSOR YSTEMS
% When used in combination, these sensor tech-
% nologies can be potent. For example, the use lidar,
%  hermal imaging, and radar can provide a three-
% dimensional map of a building and everyone and
%  verything inside.                              ■





% a chitin-ceramic hybrid material modeled on the

% microscopic structure and texture of arthropod exo-

% skeletons. This armor is obvious and has a somewhat

% crocodilian or insectoid appearance (character’s

% choice). The morph is completely hairless as well. This

% provides an Armor rating of 11/11. This armor is not

% cumulative with worn armor. [Moderate]


%  Chameleon Skin: The morph’s skin is augmented

% with complex chromatophores so that it changes color

% like the skin of a chameleon or an octopus. The morph

% can match the appearance of almost any color and

% most patterns. This provides a +20 modifier to Infiltra-

% tion Tests to avoid being seen or noticed, as long as

% the character is stationary or not moving faster than a

% %%% txt/306.txt
% slow walk. The character must also be nude or wearing
% smart clothing (p. 325) or a chameleon cloak (p. 315)
% of the same color and pattern. In addition to blending
% in, the character can also consciously change the color
% and pattern of their skin to deliberately stand out (+20
% on Perception Tests to notice) or simply to produce at-
% tractive or interesting colors or patterns. [Low]

% Circadian Regulation: The morph only requires
% 2 hours of sleep to maintain health and function at
% peak mental capacity. The character dreams con-
% stantly while asleep and can both fall asleep and
% wake up almost instantly. In addition, the character
% can easily and with no ill-effects shift to a 2-day
% cycle, where they are awake for 44 hours and sleep
% for 4. [Moderate]

% Claws: The morph has retractable claws like those
% of a cat. These claws do not interfere with the char-
% acter’s manual dexterity and are razor sharp. How-
% ever, they are relatively small and only do 1d10 + 1
% + (SOM ÷ 10) damage, with an AP of –1. As a result,
% they are legal in almost all habitats and are considered
% tools as much as weapons. [Low]

% Clean Metabolism: The morph’s symbiotic bacteria,
% gut flora, and glands have been genetically engineered
% to keep the morph “clean.” The morph also produces
% smart antibiotics that prevent the growth of any
% bacteria or yeasts in it or on its skin. As a result, the
% morph is completely immune to infections, dental cav-
% ities, and bad breath, its sweat has no scent, and the
% morph’s efficient digestion produces somewhat less
% solid waste and less odorous chemicals. [Moderate]

% Drug Glands: The morph has specially-tailored
% glands designed to produce specific hormones or
% chemicals and release them in the body. The charac-
% ter has control over these glands and can release the
% chemicals at will. Each type of drug gland is consid-
% ered a separate enhancement. For potential drugs and
% chemicals, see p. 317. [Low]

% Eelware: Derived from electric eel genetics, a char-
% acter can have eelware implanted so that it connects
% to a network of bioconductors in the hands and feet
% (or other limbs), allowing the character to generate
% stunning shocks with a touch. Eelware inflicts shock
% damage (p. 204) exactly like a pair of shock gloves.
% Eelware can also be used to power implants and spe-
% cially designed handheld devices by touch. [Low]

% Emotional Dampers: This low-cost alternative to
% endocrine control (p. 304) allows the user to vol-
% untarily damp their morph’s emotional responses
% and various non-verbal cues like pupil dilation, eye
% movement, or vocal tone. Using this augmentation
% allows the user to lie and conceal their emotions in
% such as way as oo fool the keenest observer; apply a
% +30 modifier to Deception and Impersonation Tests.
% This modification does not affect methods of detecting
% lies and emotions that involve reading the character’s
% neural state, including psi-gamma sleights. However,
% this augmentation damps out all emotional responses
% and so causes the character to be less persuasive in re-
% al-time personal interactions, imposing a –10 modifier
% to other Social skill tests like Persuasion. Characters
% can turn this augmentation on or off at will. [Low]

% Endocrine Control: This augmentation modifies the
% morph’s endocrine system, giving the character fine
% control over their hormone output. This allows the
% character to completely control their appetite and
% emotions and to regulate pain. They receive a +30
% modifier against the effects of hunger, fear, and any
% forms of emotional manipulation, such as the Drive
% Emotion sleight. This augmentation also allows char-
% acter to lie with perfect conviction and to completely
% fool all methods of lie detection that do not rely
% on the target’s neural output; apply a +20 modifier
% to Deception Tests. It also allows the character to
% remain awake for 48 hours without penalty, but after
% this time the character begins experiencing normal

% %%% txt/307.txt
% fatigue. Finally, the ability to regulate pain reception
% allows the character to ignore the –10 modifier from
% 1 wound. [High]

% Enhanced Pheromones: The morph’s biochemistry
% has been altered so that it produces enhanced phero-
% monal signals that subconsciously affect the behavior
% of other humans in the vicinity. These pheromones
% make the character more attractive and trustworthy to
% the target; apply a +10 modifier to appropriate Social
% skill tests, such as Persuasion. This augmentation only
% affects characters who can smell the pheromones, and
% it does not affect uplifts or xenomorphs. [Low]

% Enhanced Respiration: By boosting both lung ef-
% ficiency and the blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity, the
% character can live comfortably in both high and low
% pressure environments, from 0.2 atmospheres to 5
% atmospheres, with no dizziness or need for gradual
% decompression. In addition, the character can hold
% their breath for up to 30 minutes when performing
% minimal activity or for up to 10 minutes while per-
% forming highly strenuous activity. [Low]

% Gills: The morph’s lung tissue has been adapted to
% function as gills, allowing the morph to breathe both
% air and water, as long as the water is not toxic or too
% stagnant. Characters with this augmentation breathe
% in water and then expel the water through slits just
% underneath their lowest pair of ribs that seal when the
% character is not underwater. [Low]

% Grip Pads: The morph possesses specialized pads
% on its palms, lower arms, shins, and the bottoms of
% its feet. Designed to emulate the pads on gecko feet,
% characters can support themselves on a wall or ceiling
% by placing any two of these pads against any surface
% not made from a material specially designed to resist
% this augmentation. Characters can climb any surface
% and move easily across ceilings that can support their
% weight. Apply a +30 modifier to Climbing Tests. The
% pads must be free to touch the surface the character is
% climbing (no gloves). The nature of these pads is obvi-
% ous to anyone looking at them, but they do not impair
% the character’s sense of touch or manual dexterity. If
% combined with the vacuum sealing augmentation, the
% character can even stick to surfaces in the vacuum of
% space. [Low]

% Hibernation: The character can voluntarily reduce
% the morph’s metabolism to the point that the morph
% requires only 5% of the normal amount of food,
% water, and air. The character appears to sink into a
% deep sleep, but can maintain a dim awareness of both
% touch and sound and so can be easily awakened. En-
% tering or leaving this state requires 3 minutes where
% the character is relatively helpless. With sufficient
% air, characters can safely hibernate for up to 40 days
% without food or water. [Low]

% Muscle Augmentation: The morph’s muscle mass
% has been enhanced and toned and myofibers strength-
% ened. Apply a +5 modifier to SOM. [High]

% Neurachem: This bioware modification enhances
% the character’s chemical synapses and juices their
% neurotransmitters, drastically speeding up neural
% connections. Neurachem can be mentally activated or
% triggered by charged emotions. Level 1 neurachem in-
% creases the character’s Speed stat by +1, with no side
% effect. Level 2 raises the Speed stat by +2, but each
% time it is used the character suffers a nervous system
% fatigue hangover for 1 hour after the boost wears off
% (apply a –20 modifier to all actions). [High (Level 1),
% Expensive (Level 2)]

% Poison Gland: Similar to the drug gland, this
% morph has special glands that produce poisons,
% like the venom glands of a snake. The morph has
% poison glands in its fingers and mouth, so that it can
% deliver either poison by scratching someone with a
% fingernail, biting them hard enough to draw blood,
% or even by sharing a beverage with someone or spit-
% ting into their drink. The morph is immune to the
% poisons it produces. These glands may not produce
% nanotoxins. [Low]

% Prehensile Feet: The morph’s feet and leg joints are
% altered so that its toes are longer and more dexter-
% ous and the big toe is transformed into an opposable
% thumb. Physically, the morph’s feet resemble a longer
% narrower hand or a human foot with finger (and
% thumb)-like toes. The character can walk normally
% but must wear specially designed shoes. However, this
% morph runs somewhat slower than a morph with un-
% modified feet (–1 meter per Action Turn). In addition,
% the morph’s hips are slightly modified to allow greater
% mobility. In a properly constructed chair, or when
% floating in zero-G, the character can use both their
% hands and their feet to manipulate the same object.
% Most morphs used by characters who live in zero-G
% possess this augmentation. [Low]

% Prehensile Tail: A long (1.5 meters) prehensile tail
% is added to the morph’s backside, extending out from
% the tailbone. This tail is prehensile and may be used to
% grab, hold, and even manipulate objects. The character
% can control the tail’s movements with concentration,
% but it otherwise tends to move on its own. The tail
% also improves the character’s balance; apply a +10 to
% any Physical skill tests where balance is a factor. [Low]

% Sex Switch: A complex suite of alterations allows
% the character to switch their physical sex to male,
% female, hermaphrodite, or neuter. This change is
% mentally triggered but takes approximately 1 week to
% complete. [Moderate]

% Skin Pocket: The morph has a pocket within its skin
% layer, capable of holding and providing concealment
% (+30) for small items. [Trivial]

% Temperature Tolerance: The morph’s temperature
% regulation and circulation are both substantially en-
% hanced allowing the character to survive in tempera-
% tures as low as –30 degrees Celsius and as high as 60
% degrees Celsius without discomfort or ill effects. [Low]

% Toxin Filters: The morph gains an improved liver
% and kidneys and biological filters in its lungs. Charac-
% ters with this augmentation are immune to all chemi-
% cal and biological toxins, including everything from
% recreational chemicals to nerve agents to spoiled food.
% In addition, the character can safely and comfortably

% SYNTHMORPHS AND
% BIOWARE
% Though bioware is preferred and more common,
% many types of bioware can be mimicked with cy-
% bernetics. This is especially useful for synthmorphs/
% robots, which cannot be enhanced with bioware.
% The following bioware items may be replicated as
% cybernetics for synthmorphs and robots:

% • Drug Glands

% • Eelware

% • Emotional Dampers

% • Enhanced Senses (All)

% • Grip Pads

% • Mental Augmentations (All)

%  breathe smoke and drink salt water. Unlike medich-
%  ines, toxin immunity prevents the character from ex-
%  periencing even brief harm or discomfort from a toxin
%  (medichines merely rapidly repair damage caused by
%  the toxin and then remove it from the morph). This
%  augmentation provides no resistance to concentrated
%  acid, nanotechnological attacks, or similar destruc-
%  tive agents. Some characters with this augmentation
%  learn to enjoy the taste of various chemical toxins like
%  cyanide or arsenic. [Moderate]

%  Vacuum Sealing: To possess this augmentation, the
%  character must also possess some form of bioware
%  armor or carapace armor. The morph has been spe-
%  cially designed to survive the effects of vacuum. The
%  character’s skin resists vacuum as well as protecting
%  the wearer from temperatures from –75 to 100 C.
%  In addition, the character’s mouth, nose, and other
%  orifices can seal sufficiently well to resist vacuum,
%  and the morph possesses a special membrane that
%  extends over their eyes, allowing the character to
%  see in vacuum without risking any eye damage. This
%  augmentation is usually combined with either the en-
%  hanced respiration or oxygen storage augmentation,
%  or both together. [High]



%  CYBERWARE
% Very little cyberware is physically implanted. Instead,
% the morph is placed in a healing vat (p. 326) and the
% vat’s nanobots construct the cyberware inside the bio-
% morph’s body. Cyberware is rarely used for anything
% that can be accomplished using bioware.

% Synthmorphs and bots may also also use cyberware.
% ENHANCED SENSES

% In addition to being able to duplicate the affects of
% all bioware enhanced senses, there are a few enhanced
% senses that can only be produced using cyberware.

% Anti-Glare: This visual mod eliminates penalties for
% glare. [Low]

% Electrical Sense: The character can sense electric
% fields. Within 5 meters, the character can instantly
% tell if an electrical device is on or off and can see the
% precise location of electrical wiring behind a wall or
% inside a device. This sense gives the character a +10
% modifier on any test involving analyzing, repairing, or
% modifying electrical equipment. [Low]

% Radiation sense: The character can sense the pres-
% ence and approximate source of all forms of danger-
% ous radiation, including neutrons, charged particles,
% and cosmic rays. [Low]

% T-Ray Emitter: Mounted under the skin of the
% user’s forehead, this implant generates low-powered
% beams of terahertz radiation (T-rays) that allow the
% character to see using reflected T-rays. As discussed in
% Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302, this implant combined
% with the enhanced vision enhancement (or a terahertz
% sensor) allows the user to effectively see through cloth,
% plastic, wood, masonry, composites, and ceramics as
% well as being able to determine the composition of
% various materials. This implant allows the user to see
% using reflected T-rays for 20 meters in a normal atmo-
% sphere and for 100 meters in vacuum. [Low]

% MENTAL AUGMENTATION
% These cybernetic augmentations enhance the brain
% and mental functions.

% Access Jacks: Usually located in the base of the skull
% or neck, this implant is an external socket with a direct
% neural interface. It allows the character to establish a
% direct wired connection using a fiberoptic cable to
% external devices or other characters, which can be
% useful in places where wireless links are unreliable or
% complete privacy is required. Two characters linked
% via access jack can “speak” mind-to-mind and transfer
% information between their mesh inserts and other im-
% plants. All synthmorphs have these by default. [Low]

% Dead Switch: This cortical stack (p. 300) accessory is
% designed to keep the stack from falling into the wrong
% hands. If the morph is killed, the dead switch wipes
% and melts the cortical stack completely, so that the ego
% cannot be recovered. This option is generally only used
% by covert operatives with recent backups. [Low]

% Emergency Farcaster: Only characters with corti-
% cal stacks can possess this augmentation. The morph
% has an implanted quantum farcaster (p. 314) linked
% to a highly secure storage facility. The high cost of
% this implant also covers the cost of this storage. Using
% standard radio and quantum encryption, the farcaster
% broadcasts full backups of the character’s ego (pulled
% from the cortical stack) once every 48 hours. At the
% gamemaster’s discretion, the backup interval may be
% scheduled more or less frequently, keeping in mind
% that ego broadcasts are generally limited for security

% %%% txt/309.txt
% purposes and because they hog bandwidth. These
% broadcasts only work when the character is in radio
% contact with the storage facility and is typically only
% used inside a habitat to broadcast backups back to a
% nearby space ship. If the radio broadcasts are blocked
% or jammed, this device cannot make backups.

% In the event of a farcaster failure, this augmentation
% also includes a single-use emergency neutrino broad-
% caster (p. 314) as well. This broadcaster contains ap-
% proximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an
% orange-sized triply-redundant magnetic containment
% vessel. If the character is dying or urgently wishes to
% depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is
% brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of
% matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single
% brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego’s
% most recent backup. However, the heat generated by
% this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it
% and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it.

% This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and
% the broadcast can be received as long as the neu-
% trino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of
% the character. Within the solar system, this implant
% effectively guarantees the character’s backup. It is less
% useful on exoplanets where the character is out of
% neutrino range of their backup facility. The amount
% of antimatter carried by this implant is sufficiently
% small enough that it does not produce an explosion
% and will not damage any surrounding objects. Most
% habitats carefully scan all visitors to determine if they
% have this implant and if the amounts of antimatter
% involved are sufficiently low as not to pose a danger
% to the habitat and its inhabitants, and some ban this
% implant entirely. [Expensive]

% Ghostrider Module: This implant allows the
% character to carry another infomorph inside their
% head. This infomorph could be another muse, an AI,
% a backed-up ego, or a fork. The module is linked to
% the character’s mesh inserts, so the ghost-rider can
% access the mesh. The character may limit the ghost-
% rider’s access, or may allow them direct access to their
% sensory information, thoughts, communications, and
% other implants. [Low]

% Mnemonic Augmentation: A character with this
% augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital
% recordings of all of the sensory data they have ex-
% perienced in XP format (and they may share these
% recordings with others). Mnemonic augmentation
% differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it
% allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory
% data with others. It also allows them to closely ex-
% amine sensory data they did not initially look at. For
% example, If the character glanced at a note but did not
% read it, they can later use image enhancement soft-
% ware to enhance this image and in most cases actually
% read what the note said. Mnemonic augmentation
% allows the character to clearly hear all background
% noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the
% character only initially heard a few words of. Using
% mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a specific piece of
% information is quite easy, but usually requires between
% 2 and 20 minutes of concentration. [Low]

% Multi-Tasking: Only characters with cortical stacks
% can possess this augmentation. The character has an
% advanced computer installed in their brain that uses
% the data in the cortical stack to create several simulta-
% neous short-term forks to handle various mental tasks.
% By design, this computer automatically reintegrates
% all of these forks into the character’s core personality
% after a maximum of 4 hours, earlier if desired. This
% augmentation allows the character to both plan a
% speech and engage in intensive mesh-browsing while
% simultaneously fighting a gun battle or running from
% pursuit, since each of the forks operates independently.
% However, these forks can only perform purely mental
% or on-line interactions. This augmentation can pro-
% duce a maximum of two forks at a time, giving the
% character an extra two Complex Actions on every
% Action Phase for mental or on-line actions. This im-
% plant cannot be used simultaneously with any other
% augmentation that allows for extra actions, or with
% the mental speed augmentation (p. 308). [High]

% Puppet Sock: This implanted computer allows the
% biomorph’s body (the “puppet”) to be controlled by
% another character (the “puppeteer”). While active, the
% puppet has no control over their body and is simply
% along for the ride (at the gamemaster’s discretion,
% puppets who are tormented by repeated or exten-
% sive loss of control may suffer mental stress). The
% puppeteer may directly “jam” the puppet or remote
% control it in the same way that robots and pods are
% teleoperated (p. 196). The puppeteer must either be
% ghost-riding the puppet (see the Ghostrider Module, p.
% 307) or have a direct communications link (via mesh,
% radio, laser, etc.). [Moderate]

% PHYSICAL AUGMENTATIONS
% This implants enhance the morph’s physical body.

% Cyberclaws: The bones on the back of the morph’s
% hand are bonded to smart material claws. These claws
% can extend through concealed ports in the morph’s
% skin and extend 6 inches past the morph’s knuckles.
% These razor-sharp weapons inflict 1d10 + 3 + (SOM
% ÷ 10) damage and have an AP of –2. If combined
% with eelware (p. 304), they can also inflict electric
% shocks. Likewise, cyberclaws can also deliver poison
% or nanotoxins secreted from a poison gland (p. 305)
% or implanted nanotoxins. [Low]

% Cyberlimb: In an age when arms and legs can
% easily be regrown, many people consider cybernetic
% prostheses to be vulgar and distasteful. The Scum
% and others, however, treat them as iconic symbols
% of self-expression. Standard replacement cyberlimbs
% function the same as their biological equivalents,
% though that particular limb receives a +3/+3 Armor
% bonus when targeted specifically (this bonus does not
% apply to synthmorphs). Cyberlimbs may be masked
% to look real (see Synthetic Mask, p. 311), and may
% also feature small compartments for hiding/storing
% small objects. [Moderate]

% %%% txt/310.txt

% Cyberlimb Plus: More extravagant cyberlimb
% models are also available, though they require more
% severe body alteration to accommodate. These limbs
% apply a +5 SOM bonus per limb (maximum +10).
% They may be replacement limbs or “extra” limbs an-
% chored in the body’s skeletal frame. These cyberlimbs
% may not be masked. [High]

% Hand Laser: The morph has a weapon-grade laser
% implanted in its forearm, with a flexible waveguide
% leading to a lens located between the first two knuck-
% les on the morph’s dominant hand. The laser fires
% from this waveguide, inflicting 2d10 damage with 0
% AP. The laser is powered by a small nuclear battery
% located in the morph’s torso, good for 50 shots before
% it must be recharged like other beam weapon batteries
% (p. 338). [Moderate]

% Hardened Skeleton: The morph’s skeleton has been
% laced with strengthening materials. Apply a +5 DUR
% and +5 SOM bonus. [High]

% Oxygen Reserve: The morph has a miniature
% oxygen tank and rebreather installed in its torso. This
% implant provides the equivalent of the life support
% system in a light vacsuit (p. 333), allowing the charac-
% ter to breathe comfortably for up to 3 hours. It feeds
% oxygen directly to the morph’s blood stream, avoiding
% problems with pressure changes. Implanted sensors
% automatically cause the character to use the stored
% oxygen if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmo-
% sphere. Without vacuum sealing, the character can
% only survive in vacuum for 5 minutes, but remains
% conscious and active for the entire time, giving them
% far more time to find shelter or a vacsuit than charac-
% ters without this implant. For every hour the character
% is in a breathable atmosphere, this implant recovers
% one hour of oxygen storage. The implant can be fully
% recharged within 15 minutes if the character is in a
% high-pressure mostly oxygen atmosphere. [Low]

% Reflex Boosters: The morph’s spinal column and
% nervous system is rewired with superconducting
% materials, boosting transmission speed. This raises
% the character’s REF by +10 and improves Speed by
% +1. [Expensive]

% NANOWARE
% All augmentation nanoware is advanced nanotech-
% nology (p. 328), consisting of a grape-sized nanobot
% generator that produces specialized nanomachines.
% Nanoware is available for synthmorphs and bots in
% addition to biomorphs.

% Implanted Nanotoxins: The morph has an im-
% planted nanobot hive that produces nanotoxins (p.
% 324). This implant is designed so that the character
% can deploy these nanobots instantly via a scratch with
% claws, spraying with saliva, or simply making continu-
% ous bare-skin contact. Characters can choose whether
% or not to deploy these nanobots. Each nanotoxin
% generator only produces a single variety of nanobots,
% with the most common types being ones designed to
% kill or incapacitate almost any living target or ones
% designed to destroy delicate machinery. Characters
% are immune to their own nanotoxins. Nanotoxins
% are highly restricted and many habitats will not allow
% anyone with this implant on board. [Moderate]

% Medichines: This is the most common form of
% nanoware. These nanobots monitor the user’s body at
% a cellular level and fix any problems that arise.

% Medichines eliminate most diseases, drugs, and
% toxins (but not nanodrugs or nanotoxins) before
% they can do more than minor harm to the host (see
% Drug Effects, p. 317). If desired, the user can tempo-
% rarily override this protection to permit intoxication
% or other effects, but unless the character activates a
% second specially labeled override, medichines prevent
% the toxins from accumulating to lethal or permanently
% harmful levels. In this case, they can also be activated
% at a later point to reduce a drug or toxin’s remaining
% duration by half.

% Medichines allow the character to ignore the effects
% of 1 wound. They also speed normal healing as noted
% under Biomorph Healing, p. 208. If the user suffers
% 5 or more wounds at once, or more than 6 wounds
% in an hour, the damage has exceeded the medichines’
% ability to repair. In this case, the medichines place the
% character into a medical stasis, where their mind and
% body are perfectly preserved, but where the character
% cannot act in any way. Under these circumstances the
% medichines also send out a priority call for emergency
% services via the character’s mesh inserts.

% Medichines for synthmorphs and bots consist
% of nanobots that monitor and repair the shell’s
% integrity and internal system functions. Note that
% the synthmorph version of medichines allows the
% synthmorph to self-repair in the same manner by
% which a biomorph with medichines would naturally
% heal (p. 208). [Low]

% Mental Speed: With this nanoware system, nano-
% bots alter the character’s neural architecture and
% augment the functioning of their neurons. The char-
% acter can deliberately speed up their mind to think
% and also receive and process sensory information far
% faster than ordinary humans. Time seems to subjec-
% tively slow down for the character, allowing them
% to carefully plan their next action, even if they only
% have a split second to do so. With this system active,
% the character can discern things occurring too fast
% for a normal human to perceive, such as the indi-
% vidual frames of an old analog film or understanding
% sounds that were accelerated to many times their
% normal speed. The character can also read 10 times
% faster than normal and can track the paths of bullets
% and similar fast-moving objects with a successful
% Perception Test.

% When using this augmentation, the character gains
% two extra Complex Actions during each Action Phase
% that may only be used for mental actions. The charac-
% ter also receives a +30 Initiative bonus. The character
% thinks at normal speed whenever this nanoware is in-
% active. This nanoware is incompatible with any other
% augmentation that provides any form of extra actions,
% such as multi-tasking. This augmentation can be used

% %%% txt/311.txt
% as often as desired, but actively using it renders ordi-
% nary conversation and social interactions difficult and
% requires concentration to maintain. [High]

% Nanophages: These nanobots patrol the body, alert
% for signs of intrusive nanodrugs or -toxins and de-
% stroying them before they have more than a minor
% effect. Nanophages provide automatic immunity
% against nanodrugs and nanotoxins unless they are
% specifically commanded to stand down by the user, via
% their mesh implants. [Moderate]

% Oracles: These neural macrosensing nanobots pay
% attention to the sensory input on which the charac-
% ter is not focusing, alerting them about important
% things they might otherwise overlook. Oracles also
% act as a sort of memory buffer and search aid, ex-
% tending short term memory, helping the character
% recall memories and details, and crosschecking
% them with other memories. Oracles negate Percep-
% tion modifi ers for distraction, apply a +10 modi-
% fier to Investigation Tests, and add a +30 bonus to
% memory-related tests. [Moderate]

% Respirocytes: These nanobots act as highly-efficient
% artificial red blood cells, increasing the ability to
% transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide. This increases
% the morph’s ability to hold their breath to 4 hours
% and increases DUR by +5. [Moderate]

% Skillware: The morph’s brain is laced with a net-
% work of artificial neurons that may be formatted with
% downloaded information. This allows the user to
% download skillsofts (p. 332) into their brains, gaining
% the use of those programmed skills until the skillsoft
% is erased or replaced. Skillware systems are only
% capable of handling 100 total skill points worth of
% skillsofts at a time. [High]

% Skinflex: This disguise implant allows the user to
% restructure their facial features and musculature and
% alter skin tone and hair color. The entire process takes
% a mere 20 minutes. Skinflex adds +30 to Disguise
% Tests. [Moderate]

% Skinlink: Skinlink nanobots live on the morph’s
% external skin or shell, automatically swarming over
% and creating a physical connection with any electron-
% ics the user touches. They also take advantage of the
% electrical field in a biomorph’s skin for communica-
% tion. They allow the user to communicate and mesh
% with any devices merely by touching them. This
% is considered a wired link, and so is not subject to
% wireless interception or interference. Two skinlinked
% characters can also communicate and mesh simply by
% touching. [Moderate]

% Wrist-Mounted Tools: The morph has a 6 centime-
% ter-wide metal band containing nanobot generators
% implanted around each wrist. These nanobots link to-
% gether to duplicate the function of a utilitool (p. 326),
% creating narrow, highly flexible arms that each ends in
% a specialized tool. These nanobots can also produce
% tiny fiber optics to allow the character to see through
% small openings, as well as being able to create small
% weapons equal to bioware claws. The fact that these
% tool are mentally controlled gives the character a +20
% modifier to skills involving repairing or modifying de-
% vices with mechanical parts, opening locks or disarm-
% ing alarm systems, or performing first aid. [Moderate]

% COSMETIC MODS
% In an age of universal beauty, artistic cosmetic modi-
% fication of your body is commonly pursued by many
% transhumans. Body mods once considered dangerous
% or edgy are now safe and commonplace, especially
% among factions like the anarchists, scum, or brinkers.

% Bodysculpting: If your morph’s enhanced physique
% isn’t enough, you can take it further with custom
% bodysculpting such as as elongated ears or fingers,
% nose alteration, hair addition/removal, feathers, exotic

% %%% txt/312.txt
% eyes, snakeskin, endowed genitalia, and more unusual
% physical alterations. [Low]

% Nanotats: Tattoos created with nanobots can
% move around the body, change shape/color/bright-
% ness, texture, alternate text and images, and/or even
% create minor holographic effects on the skin’s sur-
% face, all controllable via mesh inserts. [Low]

% Piercings: Name any part of the body and some-
% one’s figured out a way to pierce it, probably mul-
% tiple times. Hoops, barbells, plugs, and chains are
% extremely common, often made of shapechanging
% smart materials. [Trivial]

% Scarification: Given modern medical abilities, scars
% of any sort are purely an affectation. [Trivial]

% Scent Alteration: Minor changes to a body’s bio-
% chemistry can alter a character’s natural smell or
% constantly perfume them. [Low]

% Skindyes: Dye jobs are available in all conceivable
% colors and patterns. [Trivial]

% Subdermal Implants: Adding small implants under
% the skin can create bumps, ridges, piercing anchors,
% and similar textures and alterations. [Trivial]

% ROBOTIC ENHANCEMENTS
% The following modifications are only available to
% synthmorphs/robots.

% ARMOR
% These armor modifications replace the synthmorph’s
% built-in Armor rating.

% Heavy Combat Armor: The synthmorph’s frame is
% loaded with armor that offers protection from heavy
% weapons for serious combat operations. This modi-
% fication is bulky and noticeable; the bot frame is en-
% cased in a heavy-duty carapace. It increases the bot’s
% built-in Armor to 16/16. The shell’s mobility systems
% and power output are also enhanced to deal with the
% extra load. [High]

% Industrial Armor: The shell is equipped with protec-
% tion against collisions, extreme weather, industrial ac-
% cidents, and similar wear-and-tear. Increase the bot’s
% built-in Armor rating to 10/10. [Moderate]

% Light Combat Armor: The synthmorph’s frame is
% protected by armor designed for policing and secu-
% rity duties. This increases the bot’s built-in Armor to
% 14/12. [Moderate]

% MOBILITY SYSTEMS
% Shells are designed with a wide-range of propulsion
% systems, and are sometimes built for a specific environ-
% ment/gravity. Some synthmorphs may have multiple
% mobility systems. Many such systems are retractable,
% meaning they can be folded away into the shell’s frame.

% Hopper: Hoppers have two or more legs designed
% to propel the morph forward or up, much like a frog
% or grasshopper. [Moderate]

% Hovercraft: The shell uses an impeller to blast a
% cushion of high-pressure air off the surface below,
% repelling the frame off the ground (modern hovercraft
% do not use rubber skirts). Most hovercraft travel a
% meter or so above the ground, but can temporarily
% levitate themselves higher for short periods. [Low]

% Ionic: The shell uses principles of magnetohydro-
% dynamics to levitate and fly, by ionizing surrounding
% air into plasma to create lift and momentum. The
% shell is also spun for stability. This system does not
% work in vacuum, but an underwater version uses the
% same mechanics for propulsion in liquid environ-
% ments. [High]

% Microlight: Popular in low-grav and microgravity
% environments, microlights encompass several types
% of ultralight or lighter-than-air systems, such as pow-
% ered paragliders, autogyros, balloons, aerostats, and
% blimps. These systems do not work in vacuum. [Low]

% Roller: Only for circular shells, this system allows
% the synthmorph to roll like a ball. The shell rolls
% around an interior axle, propelled by a motor-driven
% pendulum. [Moderate]

% Rotorcraft: Rotating blades create lift, allowing
% the shell to move and hover like a helicopter. Most
% models use tilt-rotors or tilt-wings so that the rotor-
% blades may be moved forward (for faster propeller-
% like propulsion) and for better maneuverability in
% zero-G. This system does not work in vacuum. [Low]

% Snake: Commonly used by slitheroids, these shells
% use lateral undulation, flexing their body from left to
% right and waving their frame forward. Such shells may
% also use sidewinding or a concertina motion (straight-
% ening forward, then retracting the rear) to move. They
% also featured gyroscope stabilization so that they may
% circle into a hoop and roll like a wheel. [Moderate]

% Submarine: Designed for undersea mobility, subma-
% rine shells use propellers or pumpjets to push through
% water. [Moderate]

% Tracked: Tracked shells use smart rotating treads to
% work their way across surfaces that would bog down
% other ground vehicles. They can prop themselves up
% in order to overcome taller obstacles or to lay them-
% selves down to bridge across a ditch or crevice. [Low]

% Thrust Vector: These shells use either turbofans or
% turbojets to create atmospheric lift with a set of wings.
% The engines may be maneuvered to point and generate
% thrust in different directions for vertical takeoffs/land-
% ings and better maneuverability in zero-G. [Moderate]

% Walker: Walkers use two or more limbs to walk or
% crawl across a surface. Many use grip pads (p. 305) or
% magnetic systems (p. 310) to stick to surfaces. [Low]

% Wheeled: Most wheeled shells feature smart
% spokes that allow the wheels to conform their shape
% to obstacles and even climb stairs. Some low-grav
% shells feature puncture-resistant and self-repairing
% compressed-gas tires. [Low]

% Winged: Primarily used by smaller shells, this system
% of four independently-controlled wings allows the
% shell to hover or move rapidly in any direction. [Low]

% PHYSICAL MODIFICATIONS
% These mods are applied to the shell’s physical frame.

% Extra Limbs: The shell is equipped with one or
% more extra limbs. A character using these limbs

% %%% txt/313.txt
%  suffers an off-hand modifier (p. 193). These limbs
% may be arms (with hand/grippers/etc.), legs, tentacle-
% like, or otherwise articulated and/or prehensile. Some
%  shells have rotational frames that allow them to move
% limbs around their body. [Low]

%  Fractal Digits: The synthmorph has “bush robot”
% digits that are capable of splitting into smaller digits,
%  and those smaller digits into micro digits, and so on
% down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine
% manipulation. Apply a +20 COO modifier where such
% fine manipulation is a factor (such as detailed repair
% work). The bot must have functioning nanoscopic
% vision (p. 311) to get this bonus. [Moderate]

%  Hidden Compartment: The shell has a concealed
%  aperture for a shielded interior compartment, ideal for
%  storing valuables or smuggling contraband. Apply a
% –30 modifier to detect this compartment either manu-
%  ally or with sensor scans. [Low]

%  Magnetic System: A magnetic system allows the
%  shell to cling to most ferrous materials. This enables
% the character to walk in zero-G situations by magneti-
%  cally adhering surfaces, hang upside down, and hold
% onto devices without letting them drop or drift away.
% The shell receives a +30 modifier whenever maintain-
% ing a magnetic hold on something. [Low]

%  Modular Design: This shell is designed to lock to-
%  gether with similar modular morphs in different archi-
% tectural patterns to create larger gestalt forms. When
% united with other modules, the group is treated as a
%  single unit/morph, with shared capabilities. If dam-
%  aged and then separated, damage and wounds are dis-
% tributed evenly between modules; uneven amounts are
%  allocated randomly. The exact capabilities of different
%  shapes depends on the composition, and is largely left
% in the gamemaster’s hands. [High]

%  Pneumatic Limbs: The limbs are equipped with
% pneumatic cylinder systems that can generate up to
% 1,500 pounds of thrust. This allows the shell to push
% off and make impressive jumps (a synth of human
%  size/weight can leap over 2 meters up). Apply a +20 to
% Freerunning Tests. A pneumatic limb used to strike an
% opponent in unarmed combat inflicts an extra 1d10
% damage. [Low]

%  Retracting/Telescoping Limbs: The shell’s limbs can
%  either be retracted completely inside it’s frame and/or
%  extended for extra length (usually up to 1 or 2 meters
%  extra). Telescoping limbs may give the shell a reach
%  advantage in melee combat (p. 204). [Low]

%  Shape Adjusting: This shell is made from smart
% materials that allow it to alter its shape, altering its
% height, width, circumference, and external features,
% while retaining the same mass. This modification is
% typically employed to reshape the morph into special
%  configurations adapted to specific tasks (for example,
% lengthening to crawl through a tunnel, widening its
% base for stability, expanding to reach out and attach
% to multiple access point simultaneously, and so on).
% This mod also allows the morph to change its features
% for disguise purposes; apply a +30 modifier to Dis-
%  guise Tests. [High]

% Structural Enhancement: This modification bolsters
% the shell’s structural integrity, boosting its ability to
% take damage. Increase Durability by 10 and Wound
% Threshold by 2. [Moderate]

% Swarm Composition: The shell is not a single unit
% but a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic mi-
% crodrones. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawl-
% ing, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nano-
% copter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, sensor
% systems, and implants are distributed throughout the
% swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into
% a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of
% tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or hold-
% ing as a unit. Individual bugs, however, are quite ca-
% pable of interfacing with electronics. Swarms cannot
% carry most gear or wear armor, and may not make
% strength-based SOM-linked skill tests. For combat
% purposes, use the same rules as given for nanoswarms,
% p. 328. Damage and wounds are reflected as dam-
% aged/massacred bugs. The swarm may be “healed” by
% manufacturing more bugs.[High]

% Synthetic Mask: The synthmorph is equipped
% with a realistic outer casing of faux-skin and care-
% fully sculpted to pass as a biomorph (perhaps even a
% particular person). The morph can cry, spit, have sex,
% and will even bleed if cut. Only a detailed physical
% examination or a radar, teraherz, or x-ray scan will
% detect the synthmorph’s true nature, and even then
% such exams/scans suffer a –30 modifier. [Moderate]

% Weapon Mount: The shell carries a built-in (or built-
% on) weapon. This weapon mount may be either internal
% (concealed, only weapons small in relation to the shell
% may fit, –30 to Perception Tests to detect) or external
% (visible). It may be fixed (one direction only), swiveling
% (limited field of fire), or on an articulated mount (all
% directions). [Low; Moderate for concealed/articulated]

% SENSORS
% 360° Vision: The shell’s visual sensors are situated for
% a 360-degree field of vision. [Low]

% Chemical Sniffer: This sensor detects molecules in the
% air and analyzes their chemical composition. It enables
% Chemistry Tests to determine the presence of gases, in-
% cluding toxins and other fumes. It can also detect the
% presence of explosives and firearms. [Moderate]

% Lidar: This sensor emits laser light and measures
% the reflections to judge range, speed, and image the
% target. See Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302. [Low]

% Nanoscopic Vision: The shell’s visual sensors can
% focus like a microscope, using advanced superlens
% techniques to beat the optical diffraction limit and
% image objects as small as a nanometer. This allows
% the character to view and analyze objects as small as
% blood cells and even individual nanobots. The synth-
% morph must stay relatively steady to view objects at
% this scale. [Moderate]

% Radar: This sensor system bounces radio or micro-
% waves off targets and measures the reflected waves
% to judge size, composition, and motion. See Using
% Enhanced Senses, p. 302. [Low]

% %%% txt/314.txt
% ARMOR
% Modern personal armor systems have advanced from
% the high modulus polyethylene thermoplastics and
% aramid fabrics of the early 21st century. Armor in
% Eclipse Phase is derived from biotech, in the form of
% organoweave fibers and crystalline-grown plates, and
% nanotech, in the form of shock-absorbing fullerene (p.
% 298) materials. Occasionally other materials are used,
% such as metallic glass plates or shear-resistant fluids
% that harden against impacts. Such armor protects
% against (armor-piercing) bullets and kinetic impacts
% as well as bladed weapons and piercing sharp objects.
% They also insulate against both the explosive heating
% of energy weapons and electrical shocks. While such
% armor protects against bullets, the layers of mate-
% rial catch the bullet and redistribute its kinetic energy
% across the body, which can still result in severe blunt
% force trauma.

% Rules for armor in combat can be found on p. 194.
% Armored exoskeletons are listed on p. 343.

% Armor Clothing: The extra-resilient organoweave
% fibers and fullerene materials that offer basic protec-
% tion against kinetic and energy weapons can be woven
% in with normal smart materials to create a wide range
% of discreet armor clothing that provides a subtle level
% of security. Such protective garments are indistin-
% guishable from regular clothing and come in all styles
% and designs. Armor clothing provides an Armor Value
% of 3/4. [Trivial]

% Armor Vest: Armor vests provide more thorough
% protection to a body’s vital areas, covering the abdo-
% men and torso completely, protecting the neck with a
% rigid collar, and even providing wrap-under protec-
% tion for the groin. Though armor vests are not bulky,
% they are obvious as armor. Armor vests may be worn
% with armor clothing without penalty. Armor vests
% provide an Armor Value of 6/6. [Low]

% Body Armor (Light): These high performance armor
% outfits protect the wearer from head to toe. An inte-
% grated armor vest is supplemented with increased pro-
% tection on the limbs and joints, while still managing to

% that sticks to bare flesh (but does not adhere to hair
% and eyes). The polymer solidifies into a form fitting
% body armor fabric when exposed to body temperature
% with the look and feel of a latex suit. Spray armor
% does not work on synthetic morphs or on clothing or

% special nanotech solvent. Spray armor has an Armor
% Value of 2/2. [Low]

% ARMOR MODS
% Armor modifications add extra materials or coatings
% that either enhance the armor’s resistance to certain
% dangers or provide other effects. Armor mods may be
% easily added or removed with the appropriate nano-
% bot applicators.

% Ablative Patches: These thin and light slap-on
% patches of stick to armor and are designed to absorb
% heat and energy from beams and explosions, safely
% vaporizing and blowing hot gas away. Ablative
% patches increases the Armor Value by +4/+2, but each
% hit reduces both the energy and kinetic value of the
% ablative armor by 1. [Trivial]

% Chameleon Coating: This provides the armor with
% the same effect as the chameleon cloak (p. 315). [Trivial]

% Fireproofing: Fireproofing includes the addition of
% heat-resistant ceramic or fire-resistant layers, both
% capable of withstanding extremely high temperatures.
% Fireproofing increases the Armor Value by +2/+0, and
% provides an additional 10 points of armor against
% heat or fire specifically. [Trivial]

% Immunogenic System: The immunogenic mod
% adds an active nanobot swarm, maintained by a spe-
% cialized hive, that coats the outer layer of armor and
% also the non-armored parts of the wearer’s morph.
% It acts as an outer immune system designed to neu-
% tralize toxic agents and nanotoxins with which it
% comes into contact. This provides immunity to drugs,
% toxins, and nanotoxins applied dermally, such as
% with a slap patch or splash grenade. It has no effect
% on inhaled, oral, or injected drugs (including coated
% weapons). [Low]

% Lotus Coating: The armor has been impregnated
% with a superhydrophic coating (contact angle of
% around 170°) that repels all water-like liquids. If the
% armor is splashed by liquid toxins or chemicals, the
% effect is reduced since the liquids starts to roll off the
% armor. Apply a +30 modifier when defending against
% liquid-based attacks. [Trivial]

% Offensive Armor: When activated, the outer layer of
% this armor is rigged to shock anyone or anything that
% contacts it with electricity. Treat its DV and effect as a
% shock baton (p. 334). [Low]

% Reactive Coating: A thick layer of advanced
% nanotech is applied to the armor, protecting it with
% a colony of nanobots designed to sense incoming
% attacks. When an attack strikes the coating, it deto-
% nates to disrupt the attack. Bursts and full autofire
% are treated as a single attack. A reactive coating
% increases the Armor Value by +5/+5, but each deto-
% nation automatically inflicts 1 point of damage on
% the wearer. Reactive armor also works against melee
% attacks, but the attacker also suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 (round
% up) points of damage per attack (armor protects)
% from the microexplosion. Reactive coating only
% works against 5 attacks, after which the specialized
% nanobot hive replenishes the coating at the rate of 1
% use per hour. [Moderate]

% Refractive Glazing: A combination of reflectors,
% refractive metamaterials, and an energy transfer
% system with heat radiators provides extra protection
% against energy weapons. Increase the Armor Value
% by +3/+0. [Low]

% Self-Healing: The armor is equipped with a nano-
% hive that acts like repair spray (p. 333). [Moderate]

% Shock Proof: Shock proof armor is electronically
% insulated to discharge and reduce the effect of shock
% weapons. Apply an additional +10 modifier when resist-
% ing the DV and effects of shock weapons (p. 204). [Low]

% Thermal Dampening: Thermal dampening obfus-
% cates heat signatures by converting body heat into
% electric energy. It makes the target more difficult to
% spot with thermal sensors; apply a –30 modifier for
% Perception Tests. [Moderate]

% COMMUNICATIONS
% The oldest and most widespread communications
% technology still in regular use is radio. Every habitat
% and world inhabited by transhumanity is awash in
% radio traffic, with humans, machines, and uplifts all
% constantly communicating with one another. The
% smallest radios are no larger than a spec of dust and
% have a range of no more than 20 meters, while the
% largest are the size of a truck and have a range of
% many thousands of miles. Radios large and small are
% ubiquitous and almost all devices contain at least
% short-range radios so they may interact with the
% mesh. Most morphs are equipped with basic mesh
% inserts (p. 300) that include an implanted radio. For
% radio ranges, see p. 296.

% Fiberoptic Cable: Fiberoptic cables are used to
% establish wired connections between two devices.
% Given the ubiquity of radios and the tangled mess
% wires cause, they are typically only used for privacy
% (unlike radio communication, fiberoptic signals may
% not be intercepted) or in areas with heavy radio
% interference. [Trivial]

% %%% txt/316.txt

% Laser/Microwave Link: These portable devices are
% used to establish a tight-beam, line-of-sight commu-
% nications channel with another laser or microwave
% link. The range of these transceivers varies widely
% with environmental factors, but approximates 50
% kilometers in atmosphere and 500 kilometers in
% space (though horizon limits must be kept in mind,
% being 5 kilometers at ground level on Earth and less
% on smaller bodies). Lasers are subject to interference
% from fog, dirt, smoke, and similar visual chaff, while
% microwaves may be hindered by metallic obstructions.
% These links may only be intercepted by getting directly
% in between the beams. Some teams carry a micro ver-
% sion of this system, worn on their person, allowing
% line of sight intra-team communications that cannot
% be intercepted like radio. [Moderate]

% Radio Booster: This device boosts the range and
% sensitivity of short-range radios, like those from im-
% plants, ectos, or microbugs. The booster must be with
% the shorter-ranged device’s range (or directly linked
% via fiberoptic cable). It will repeat any transmissions
% received from that device, but at its extended range of
% 25 kilometers in urban areas (250 kilometers remote
% areas). Broadcasts from a radio booster are easy to
% receive by anyone looking for broadcasts (see Wire-
% less Scanning, p. 251), though transmissions may be
% stealthed (p. 252). Boosters are commonly used by
% characters traveling far from habitats or other civi-
% lized regions. [Low]

% NEUTRINO COMMUNICATORS
% Neutrinos are particles that can pass through any
% solid matter with ease and are impossible to block. As
% a result, they make an ideal medium for communica-
% tions. Unfortunately, they are also easy to intercept.
% Even a tight beam of neutrinos sent between two lo-
% cations can be intercepted simply by placing another
% receiver behind the location the broadcaster is sending
% to. Neutrino communicators require a large power
% plant to power the high energy particle interactions
% required to generate the neutrino broadcast. Neutrino
% receivers are also relatively large, with the smallest
% occupying 100 cubic meters. In most cases, neutrino
% communicators are designed to broadcast neutrinos
% in all directions, though tight-beam transmissions are
% also possible. Quite often neutrino communications
% take advantage of quantum farcasting for security.

% Neutrino Transceiver: This transceiver is capable of
% generating and receiving neutrino signals at a range of
% at least 100 astronomical units. It is large, with a size
% of 8 cubic meters (in a cube 2 meters on a side), but
% they can be loaded onto large vehicles. To function, it
% must be connected to a large power plant, such as one
% found in habitats or large spacecraft. The cost and
% size of this device includes the computer necessary for
% quantum farcasting. [Expensive]

% QUANTUM FARCASTERS
% Quantum farcasters are special computers designed to
% protect a communications channel (such as fiberoptic,
% radio, laser/microwave, or neutrino) with unbreak-
% able encryption. To function, two or more quantum
% farcaster computers must first be entangled together
% (on a quantum level) in the same physical location.
% The farcasters may then be separated, at which point
% they may continue to exchange encrypted data via
% quantum teleportation. This data exchange requires
% a standard communications link (fiberoptic, radio,
% laser/microwave, or neutrino), and so is limited by
% the speed of light, but it is a high bandwidth form
% of communications. The quantum encryption used
% by these entangled farcasters is unbreakable, and any
% attempted interception is immediately detected and
% neutralized. A quantum farcaster may not be used to
% securely communicate with any farcasters other than
% the ones it is entangled with.

% %%% txt/317.txt

% Because it is exceptionally safe and secure, quantum
% farcasting via neutrino communications is the primary
% means of both long-distance communication between
% habitats and egocasting (p. 276). The neutrino signal
% cannot be blocked and it can only be decrypted if a
% character has access to the computer that is sending
% or receiving the signal.

% Miniature Radio Farcaster: Miniature farcasters
% communicate with each other using standard radio
% transceivers. As noted above, they may only securely
% communicate with the other farcasters with which they
% are entangled. Most miniature farcasters are worn as
% jewelry or fitted into clothing or other equipment. [Low]

% QUANTUM ENTANGLED COMMUNICATION
% The rarest form of communications is quantum en-
% tangled (QE) communication. QE communication is
% instantaneous and works over any distance, but is
% also very limited. QE communication requires pairs
% of entangled particles known as qubits. To use QE,
% large number of pairs of qubits are created and then
% separated from each other. Millions of these sepa-
% rated pairs of particles are stored in special containers
% known as qubit reservoirs. If two QE communicators
% each have a qubit reservoir containing qubits that are
% each entangled with qubits in the other communica-
% tor’s qubit reservoir, then characters can use the two
% QE communicators to commutate with one another
% instantaneously. Characters can use QE to instantly
% communicate between any two locations, even if one
% character is in the solar system and the other has
% passed through a Pandora gate and is standing on a
% planet 500 light years away.

% Each bit of data transmitted between these two QE
% comms uses up one qubit. Once all of the qubits are
% used up, the two QE comms can no longer communi-
% cate with each other until they each get a new batch
% of entangled qubits. Qubits are expensive to produce,
% contain, and transport, making this an exceedingly
% expensive form of communication. As a result, ex-
% tremely high bandwidth communications like full
% sensory AR and egocasting cannot be performed using
% QE communication.

% Portable QE Comm: This is a handheld FTL com-
% munications device. The actual communications unit
% can be made as small as desired, but must be large
% enough to connect to or hold a qubit reservoir. Be-
% cause qubit reservoirs are relatively large and must be
% replaced, they are rarely implanted. Some miniature
% farcasters are designed so that users can also attach
% qubit reservoirs to enable them to be used for both
% light speed and FTL communication. [Low]

% Low-Capacity Qubit Reservoir: Low-capacity qubit
% reservoirs can be used for 10 hours of high-resolution
% video conferencing or meshbrowsing and 100 hours
% of voice or text only communications. [High]

% High-Capacity Qubit Reservoir: High-capacity qubit
% reservoirs can be used for 100 hours of high-resolution
% video conferencing or meshbrowsing and 1,000 hours

% BUGS AND

% SURVEILLANCE

% Though surveillance technologies are pervasive

% and easy to come by in Eclipse Phase, secretly

% obtaining information on someone who wants

% to retain privacy can be quite difficult. Micro-

% bugs, smart dust, and similar recording devices

% that are all but invisible may be exceptionally

% easy to put into place, but once they begin ac-

% tively transmitting, they are easy to to detect

% (see Wireless Scanning, p. 251). An eavesdropper

% may attempt to stealth the signal (see Stealthed

% Signals, p. 252), but this is not guaranteed to

% work. Once a signal is detected, locating the

% broadcasting device is usually just a matter of

% time (see Tracking, p. 251).


% Some recording devices attempt to avoid this

% problem by using miniature quantum farcasters

% (p. 314), but those are far larger and more dif-

% ficult to hide. Often the most effective way to

% acquire discrete information is to plant a surveil-

% lance device, set to record but not transmit, and

% then retrieve it later. While doing this is often

% difficult and risky, the recording device never

% reveals its presence by broadcasting and so is

% more difficult to detect.                        ■




% COVERT AND ESPIONAGE TECHNOLOGIES
% These technologies allow characters to acquire pro-
% tected information and to gain access to places that
% others try to keep them out of. Many of these devices
% are mesh-capable and equipped with radios, see p. 296
% for radio ranges.

% Chameleon Cloak: This loose, poncho-like cloak
% contains a network of sensors that perceive wave-
% lengths from microwave to ultra-violet. A similar net-
% work of miniature emitters precisely replicate the in-
% formation its sensors receive, making the wearer seem
% transparent to those wavelengths. A chameleon cloak
% allows a character to effectively become invisible as
% long as they are stationary or not moving faster than
% a slow walk. When worn by someone moving faster,
% the cloak still provides a +30 modifier to Infiltration
% Tests to avoid being seen or noticed.

% Chameleon cloaks are not effective against radar,
% x-ray, or gamma-ray sensors. They do hide the char-
% acter from thermal infrared, however, by absorbing
% the character’s body heat into its heat sink. The cloak
% can only absorb a character’s body heat for one hour
% before it must emit this heat. Heat emission also re-
% quires one hour, during which time the character is
% easily visible in the thermal infrared spectrum. [Low]

% Covert Operations Tool (COT): This handheld
% device is the ultimate in infiltration technology. It con-
% tains both smart matter micromanipulators, cutting

% %%% txt/318.txt
% tools, and an advanced nanotechnology generator
% capable of producing nanobots that can bore or cut
% through almost any material and disable or open
% almost any electronic lock.

% Cutting out a lock or boring a 1-millimeter hole in
% a wall with a COT requires ((Durability + Armor) ÷
% 10) seconds. Cutting out a 1-meter diameter hole in
% a wall requires ((Durability + Armor) ÷ 10) minutes.
% These same nanobots can later be used to repair this
% damage so that it is invisible to any but the most care-
% ful and detailed examination.

% A COT can easily open any old-fashioned mechani-
% cal lock simply by analyzing it and shaping an ap-
% propriate key, though this takes a full Action Turn.
% It can also open electronic locks by infiltrating them
% with nanobots that influence the lock’s electronics,
% no matter what authentication system the lock uses.
% Opening electronic locks takes a full Action Turn, but
% success is practically guaranteed. Opening an elec-
% tronic lock in this manner will, however, trigger an
% alarm and/or be logged as an event. For more details,
% see Electronic Locks, p. 291. [High]

% Cuffband: This smart plastic loop restricts around
% a prisoner’s limbs when activated. If the prisoner
% struggles, it will tighten more. Cuffbands will inform
% the user if they are cut or loosened and are electron-
% ically-controlled, so the user can release the prisoner
% remotely. Some cuffband variants including a shock
% system (treat as a shock baton, p. 334) to zap and
% restrain unruly prisoners. [Low]

% Dazzler: The dazzler is a tiny laser system set on
% a rotating ball. When activated, it consistently spins
% and emits laser pulses in all directions. These laser
% pulses are not dangerous, but they detect the lenses
% of camera systems (including specs, viewers, and bot/
% synthmorph sensors) and repeatedly zap them with
% laser pulses of varying strength to overload and dazzle
% them. For as long as a dazzler is active, any camera
% system (visual, infrared, and ultraviolet) within line
% of sight and within 200 meters is blinded. [Moderate]

% Disabler: This handy device emits an overloading
% surge that completely incapacitates and disables a
% synthetic morph or pod (anything with a cyberbrain)
% when it is plugged into an access jack and activated.
% The affected cyberbrain will be unable to function until
% the signal is deactivated, effectively shutting down the
% ego (or AI). In order to plug a disabler into an unwill-
% ing target, the target must first be grappled or a called
% shot must be successfully made in melee combat. This
% device does not work on larger synthetic morphs (like
% vehicles) or on cyberbrainless robots.[High]

% Fiber Eye: This is a flexible and electronically-con-
% trollable length of fiberoptic cable and viewer, which
% can be worked through cracks, under doors, and
% around corners to peep unobtrusively. [Low]

% Invisibility Cloak: This cloak is made of metama-
% terials with a negative refractive index, so that light
% actually bends around it, making it and anything it
% covers invisible. This invisibility works from the
% microwave to ultraviolet spectrums, but not against
% radar or x-rays. The drawback is that anything con-
% cealed within the cloak can’t see out. This is easily
% overcome by using external sensor feeds (if available)
% and entoptics to navigate. Alternately, a small piece of
% anti-cloak, which cancels the cloak’s invisibility prop-
% erties when touched together, can be used to create a
% small window to peep out of, though this increases
% the chance of being spotted. Noticing such a window
% requires a Perception Test with a –30 modifier. [High]

% Microbug: This device is a tiny camera and micro-
% phone 1 millimeter across. It has the visual capabili-
% ties of a set of specs (p. 325). It can hear everything
% within 20 meters and see everything within the same
% range that is in its line of sight. A microbug can record
% up to 100 hours of information. Microbugs can be
% set to broadcast continuously, at set intervals, or only
% when they receive a special signal. If desired, they
% can also be set to only record if there is movement
% or voices in the room they are in. Microbugs have
% adhesive backs and can stick to almost any surface.
% Microbugs can also establish their location via mesh
% positioning or GPS, and so double as tracking devices.
% To avoid being detected by their radio transmissions,
% some microbugs are attached to miniature quantum
% farcasters (p. 314). These microbugs are much larger
% (1 centimeter) and easy to see, but their transmissions
% cannot be detected or blocked. [Trivial, Low for quan-

% Prisoner Mask: This hood tightens around the

% engages in low-level jamming in order to prevent any
% wireless communication via mesh inserts. [Medium]

% Psi Jammer: This device jams frequencies used
% by brainwaves within a 20-meter radius. This has
% no effect on brain functions, but it does prevent
% any ranged used of psi sleights within this area of
% effect. [Moderate]

% Quantum Computer: These advanced devices
% make use of quantum computation, allowing them
% to handle extremely large numbers with ease. This
% makes them especially useful for codebreaking, as
% noted on p. 254. [Expensive]

% Smart Dust: This device is a walnut-sized special-
% ized nanobot generator that creates tiny sensor nano-
% bots, each one of which is a tiny sphere the diameter
% of a human hair. A packet of smart dust nanobots is
% sufficient to perform detailed surveillance on a large

% short legs that allow them to walk and climb at a rate
% of 5 cm per second.

% When a character dumps a packet of smart dust in
% a room, it will cover every surface in the room within
% 20 minutes, including all furniture and the insides
% of every drawer and other space that is not airtight.
% At this point, the smart dust has recorded all data
% about the room that can be obtained by exceedingly
% detailed observation, including the DNA of everyone

% %%% txt/319.txt
% who has visited the room in the last week or two. The
% smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly
% compressed signal, or it can send all of its informa-
% tion to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a
% pre-arranged destination for pickup and downloading
% by their user. The user need only find a single nano-
% bot with a nanodetector to acquire the information
% obtained by the smart dust. If ordered to do so, the
% remaining nanobots can either power down and await
% further orders or self-destruct in a fashion that turns

% merges right into humanity’s popular pastime of
% recreational substance abuse. Drugs of all kinds,
% whether they be chemical, nano-based, or electronic,
% are not only popular but widespread. While advances
% in biotechnology have eliminated many of the side
% effects that once plagued drug users, transhuman
% bodies remain complicated environments, and so side
% effects (especially with long-term use) are still a factor.
% Additionally, addiction is always a consideration for
% anyone who gets comfortable with popping the same
% pills too often, though there are also drugs for addic-
% tion of course

% Drug descriptions include benefits, side effects, no-
% ticeable signs that a person is using the drug, addictive-
% ness, and effects from long-term use). Descriptions also
% include the drug’s Duration and its Addiction Modifier
% (see Addiction and Substance Abuse).
% SUBSTANCE RULES
% These rules explain how to handle drugs and toxins.

% CLASSIFICATION OF SUBSTANCES
% Substances fall into four categories:

% Chemicals: These are pharmacologically-active
% small chemical compounds (toxins, pharmaceuticals,
% chemical drugs) that have been produced by chemical
% synthesis, nanotech fabrication, or enzymatic biosyn-
% thesis in (transgenic) organisms. They include natural-
% ly-occurring drugs from known species of (exo-)flora
% and fauna, endotoxins produced by biological organ-
% isms, enhancements of endogenic substances (designer
% drugs), and de novo developments designed for a
% specific medical or recreational application. Chemical
% drugs affect only biological morphs and pods.

% Biologicals: These include peptides, hormones, and
% biologically-based substances like biotoxins, bacteria,
% and viral organisms—drugs devised or based on
% naturally-occurring endogenic biological substances.
% This category also includes infectious biological or-
% ganisms that can produce drug-like effects, like virii
% and bacteria. Biologicals affect biomorphs and pods
% but not synthetic morphs or infomorphs.

% Nanodrugs: These are temporary nanobot colonies
% programmed to create a certain effect. While nano-
% bots are generally able to target or infect all morph
% types except infomorphs, exactly which morphs are
% affected usually depends on the pre-programmed
% effect (i.e., whether it targets a biological or mechani-
% cal mechanism).

% Electronic: Electronic drugs include software and
% technology that affect the brain directly, such as ma-
% nipulative XP programs or retro-tech like transcranial
% magnetic stimulation or cranial electrotherapy. It also
% includes narcoalgorithms—programs that reproduce
% drug-like effects for AIs, infomorphs, and egos resid-
% ing in cyberbrains.

% APPLICATION METHODS
% There are number of vectors by which a substance
% may be applied to a morph.

% Dermal (D): This drug or toxin is absorbed via
% the skin (or exterior hull with some nanotoxins) as
% either a gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., paste). Slap patches
% and slap bands are commonly used, loaded with the
% chemical DMSO, which transfers the drug through
% the skin.

% Inhalation (INH): This is a gas that is breathed into
% the lungs or snorted nasally. Used for inhalers, aero-
% sols, powders, and gas grenades/seekers.

% Injected (INJ): This liquid is applied via either
% an intramuscular or intravenous injection. Used for
% needles and piercing weapons.

% Oral (O): This is a liquid or solid that is absorbed
% through the stomach or oral cavity (eating or drink-
% ing). Used with pills and liquids.

% %%% txt/320.txt
% DRUG EFFECTS
% If a character is exposed to a drug via its method of
% application—for example, they pop a pill, slap on
% a dermal patch, are soaked with a splash grenade,
% breathe in gas, or get stabbed with a coated weapon—
% then they are subject to the drug’s effects. The onset
% time determines how long these effects take to kick in,
% and the duration determines how long they last.

% While there is no resistance test to ignore a drug or
% toxin’s effects once exposed, in some cases (especially
% toxins) a test might be called for to determine the
% severity of the effects.

% Unless otherwise noted or specifically overridden,
% medichines (p. 308) will protect a character from
% drug/toxin effects (but not nanodrugs/nanotoxins).
% Enhancements like toxin filters (p. 305) may also
% impede a drug’s effect or provide complete resistance.
% If an antidote is taken in advance or before the effects
% kick in, the drug will not work.

% ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
% Some drugs are addictive, either physically (affect-
% ing the morph) or mentally (affecting the ego)—and
% sometimes both. Every time a character uses the drug
% (or after an appropriate amount of use, as determined
% by the gamemaster), they must make a WIL x 3 Test to
% avoid addiction. Each drug has an Addiction Modifier
% that will modify this test.

% Failure indicates that the character has become
% addicted—they immediately acquire the Addiction
% negative trait (p. 148). Addiction is measured in three
% levels: Minor, Moderate, and Major. The severity de-
% termines how often an addicted character needs the
% drug and what the negative effects of not using the
% drug are.

% An addicted character must continue to make WIL
% x 3 Tests as they use the drug, as determined by the
% gamemaster. Failure indicates the character’s addic-
% tion severity increases.

% The negative effects from not using a drug end
% whenever the character does the drug again. Durabil-
% ity and Lucidity penalties are not damage, but tempo-
% rary decreases to the character’s maximum values; the
% character immediately regains the lost Durability or
% Lucidity when they do the drug again.

% Addiction is of indefinite duration. To clean up,
% the character must stay off the drug for 1 week for
% each level of addiction. Resisting this craving is dif-
% ficult, and should at least require another WIL x 3
% Test, modified by the drug’s Addiction modifier. Play-
% ers and gamemasters are encouraged to roleplay an
% attempt to kick a habit. Each week the character is
% off the drug, the addiction drops by one level. When
% it reaches 0, the character is clean ... though there is
% always danger of a relapse.

% Physical addictions do not carry over to a new
% morph if the character resleeves, but mental ad-
% dictions do. If the character uploads and resleeves,
% the mental addictions persist, and the morph the
% character leaves behind remains physically addicted.
% This means that poor or unlucky characters may
% occasionally find themselves resleeved into a morph
% that has a physical addiction. In this case, the charac-
% ter is subject to the physical addictiveness of the drug
% but not the mental addiction, although if they break
% down and indulge in the drug, they may themself
% become physically addicted.

% Characters who resleeve as infomorphs can remain
% mentally addicted to a substance despite no longer
% having a body. The market is always happy to provide,
% though; a wide variety of narcoalgorithms mirroring
% the effects of most of the drugs described below are
% available for infomorphs and AIs. For the infomorph-
% ported narcoalgorithm version of any physically-
% only addictive drug described below, consider the
% Addictiveness to be effectively physical. The character
% remains addicted as long as they are an infomorph,
% but they do not remain addicted if they sleeve into a
% physical morph.

% DRUGS
% The drugs described here are usually (but not always
% beneficial), and are typically taken intentionally. Drugs
% and chemicals used offensively are described under
% Chemicals and Toxins, both on p. 323.

% Note that the drugs here are just a representative
% sampling. There are thousands if not millions of
% drugs in circulation in Eclipse Phase—gamemasters
% are encouraged to introduce their own, using these
% as guidelines.

% COGNITIVE DRUGS
%  Nootropics and similar drugs are intended to boost
%  the user’s mental faculties.

%  Drive: This nootropic speeds up left-right brain
%  hemisphere communication, stimulates idea produc-
%  tion, and improves concentration, with no usual side
%  effects. Users receive a +5 bonus to COG while the
%  drug lasts. [Low]

%  Klar: Klar boosts alertness and enhances clarity and
%  perception. Users report a feeling of being “elevated”
%  to a higher level. They receive +5 INT while the drug
%  lasts. [Low]

%  Neem: Neem is a mnemonic drug that works by
% “tagging” experiences and mental input with a set of
%  unique sensations that contribute to the formation
%  of state-based memories. Neem gummy chews come
%  in a variety of fruit flavors shaped like extinct old
%  Earth animals. Neem gives characters a +20 bonus
%  on COG Tests to recall information they learned
%  while on Neem (see Memorizing and Remembering,
%  p. 176). The drawback to Neem is that memories they
%  accumulate while under the drug’s influence have no
%  emotional association. For example, a character who
%  witnessed something horrible happening to a friend
%  or who had a fight with a romantic partner while on
%  Neem would feel no emotional connection whatsoever
%  to what happened. [Moderate]

% %%% txt/321.txt
% COMBAT DRUGS
% Combat drugs are an easy way of evening the odds
% in a fight.

% BringIt: In some respects more a social than a
% combat drug, BringIt stimulates massive bursts of ag-
% gression pheromones designed to make the user the
% center of attention in a fight. In combat, opponents
% within 3 meters of the character not already in un-
% armed or melee combat with another character must
% pass a WIL x 3 Test or attack the character using Br-
% ingIt. The nature of airborne pheromones is imprecise,
% however, so if the character using BringIt is within
% 1 meter of another character hostile to the character
% affected, the affected character may opt to attack the
% proximate character instead of the BringIt user. Char-
% acters using this drug suffer a –20 modifier on social
% skill tests. [Low]

% Grin: Grin is an effective opiate and pain sup-
% pressant. Users may ignore the –10 modifiers from
% 2 wounds (not cumulative with similar effects), and
% in fact may not even be aware they are injured. Grin
% users suffer from tunnel vision, however, and so suffer
% a –10 modifier on Perception Tests. [Low]

% Kick: Kick is a strong stimulant that increases the
% user’s response time and puts them on edge. The char-
% acter gains +10 REF and +1 Speed for the duration of
% the drug. Characters under the influence of Kick are
% twitchy, however, reacting in a jumpy, cat-like fashion
% to sudden or unexpected stimuli. At the gamemaster’s
% discretion, they must make a WIL x 2 Test or react
% without thinking towards unexpected noises or other
% surprises. Long-term users suffer –5 COO. [Moderate]

% MRDR: MRDR is a straightforward and brutal
% combat drug. It increases pain tolerance, speed, and
% strength. The character receives +10 SOM, +1 Speed,
% +10 Durability, and may ignore the –10 modifier of
% one wound. Any damage incurred while under the
% effects of the drug is taken from the bonus Durabil-
% ity first. MRDR users are easily identifiable by the
% broken blood vessels in their eyes, tense posture, and
% visible tension in the muscles of the face, arms, and
% legs. Long-term users suffer –5 SOM. [Low]

% Phlo: Phlo increases alertness and coordination,
% making the user more graceful and nimble in a fray.
% The character gains +5 COO and +10 on Perception
% Tests for the duration of the drug. Everything feels
% possible to a character on Phlo, and so they are vul-
% nerable to being goaded into actions that might be
% foolish or dangerous (apply a –10 modifier to appro-
% priate Social Skill Tests). [Moderate]

% HEALTH DRUGS
% Pharma-foods that boost the consumer’s health and
% physical state are common.

% Bananas Furiosas: This drug reverses some of the
% effects of de-ionizing radiation on the cells of the
% body. Although a pill form is available, it most com-
% monly comes in large bunches of bright orange-red
% bananas. Bananas reduce the severity of a radiation
% dosage (gamemaster determines effect). [Low]

% %%% txt/322.txt

% Comfurt: This tasty yogurt treat blocks stress hor-
% mones, stabilizes mood, and relieves anxiety, allowing
% them to ignore the effect of 1 trauma and temporarily
% boosting Lucidity by +5. Any stress suffered while the
% drug is in effect is taken from the bonus Lucidity first.
% Comfurt also provides a +10 bonus when resisting
% attempts to manipulate the user’s emotions. Excessive
% use of Comfurt can lead to chronic itchiness caused by
% histamine release. [Low]

% RECREATIONAL DRUGS
% These drugs compete with petals (p. 321) and black
% market XP for wasting people’s time and lives away.

% Buzz: This gene-modified variant of BZ is an odor-
% less, invisible, extremely powerful hallucinogen. Users
% or affected characters will undergo extremely realistic
% hallucinations for the duration, and may even “share”
% hallucinations with other affected characters. Charac-
% ters will suffer a –30 modifier to any tests to remember
% what occurred while under the influence. [Moderate]

% Mono No Aware: Taken from the Japanese term
% for sadness at the ephemerality of worldly things, this
% drug, typically ingested as a tea, is a depressant that
% induces a meditative state. Mono No Aware gives the
% character a +10 bonus on Art and Sense Tests. With
% frequent use, Mono No Aware reacts with pigments
% in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge,
% even in darker-skinned morphs. [Low]

% Orbital Hash: Good ol’ reefer—but grown in space
% using powerful lighting and post-singularity hydropon-
% ics. Because space is at a premium in habitats and scum
% barges, blocks of hashish are the preferred mode of

%  SOCIAL DRUGS
%  These social lubricants affect the user’s interactions
%  with others.

% Alpha: Alpha is a more subtle version of BringIt,
%  popular with hypercorp execs, street thugs, and
%  anyone else who wants to come across as a domineer-
%  ing asshole. The pharm designer who invented it had
%  a retro sensibility (and maybe a sick sense of humor);
%  Alpha is typically synthesized as a sparkling white
%  powder designed to be snorted. Alpha stimulates
%  production of threat pheromones, but less bluntly
%  than BringIt. Alpha imparts confidence, a feeling of
%  power, and alertness. Users can function without sleep
%  for 4 days, after which point they need to catch up
%  with at least 4 hours of sleep (remember morphs with
%  basic biomods require less sleep). Dosed characters
%  receive a +20 modifier on Intimidation Tests and +10
%  on Persuasion and Networking Tests where attitude is
%  a factor (gamemaster discretion). These bonuses only
%  apply to characters within 2 meters of the Alpha user.

% On the downside, alpha users are impatient, unfo-
%  cused assholes. At the gamemaster’s discretion, Social
%  skill modifiers may be reversed to penalties with
%  certain types of people. Additionally, Alpha users
%  suffer –10 on all COG skill tests related to memory

%  and coherent or logical thinking. Long-term users may
%  suffer the COG penalty even when not on the drug;
%  on it, they may be worse. [High]

%  Hither: Want to ooze sexy like a pleasure morph
%  on a hot tin roof? For those desiring that slinky je-ne-
%  sais-quoi, Hither is the tool. Hither is a clear, slippery
%  gel, sometimes with a faint, musky, floral scent. Hither
%  is applied to parts of the body with large concentra-
%  tions of sweat glands, where the skin quickly absorbs
%  it. Hither is a mild euphoriant, imparting a feeling of
%  confidence and you-know-you-want-it-ness to the user.
%  It also stimulates abundant production of lust phero-
%  mones. The character gains a +10 bonus on Persuasion
%  Tests against targets who are possible to seduce. At the
%  gamemaster’s discretion, this extends to Deception,
%  Impersonate, and Networking Tests. [Low]

%  Juice: This potent anti-depressant makes it almost
%  impossible to have bad feelings or negative thoughts.
%  The character is unnaturally happy—often irritatingly
%  or strangely so. The character receives a +30 bonus
%  against fear or attempts to manipulate their emotions
%  in a negative direction, but is also likely to act inap-
%  propriately, like giggling over the massive amount of
%  spilled blood or cheerfully changing the subject to
%  inane topics when someone else is freaking out. [Low]

%  NANODRUGS
%  Nanodrugs are temporary nanobot infestations that
%  apply a specific effect.

%  Frequency: Frequency (or Freeq) is a nanodrug de-
%  signed as a tool for scientific visualization. It releases
%  a small swarm of nanobots into the character’s blood-
%  stream that settle in the epidermis, where they act as
%  sensors of electromagnetic radiation. This sensory
%  input is then injected into the character’s visual and
%  tactile sensoria, hitting the user with a sequence of
%  novel stimuli, typically a light show or weird tactile
%  sensations. Aside from its recreational uses, Frequency
%  is good at picking up on localized field radiation with
%  a standard Perception Test. A character can take ad-
%  vantage of this to spot sensors and hidden electronics.
%  Similar to now-obsolete 20th-century hallucinogens
%  like LSD and psilocybin, however, a Frequency trip
%  can be disorienting and upsetting (the gamemaster
%  should apply any modifiers, mental stress, or even
%  trauma as they feel appropriate). Characters typically
%  experience a period about 1/3 of the way through
%  their trip in which sensory input is extremely intense;
%  during this period, which usually lasts about 2 hours,
%  they are unable to read. [Moderate]

% OTHER NANODRUGS


% Nanodrugs have the capability of making fun-


% damental changes to a body’s biochemistry and


% mental state. The potential effects are too nu-


% merous to list, but gamemasters should consider


% allowing nanodrugs that temporarily apply cer-


% tain traits, such as Brave, Direction Sense, Math


% Wiz, Pain Tolerance, Psi Chameleon, Psi Defense,


% Situational Awareness, Tough, Feeble, Frail, Low


% Pain Tolerance, Mental Disorder, Mild Allergy,


% Neural Damage, Psi Vulnerability, Severe Al-


% lergy, Timid, VR Conditioning, VR Vertigo, Weak


% Immune System, or Zero-G Nausea. Similarly,


% the nanodrug could force the character into a


% particular mental emotional state, such as a bad


% mood, edginess, contentment, or overconfi-


% dence. Gamemasters are encouraged to experi-


% ment with different possibilities and effects. ■





%  Gravy: Gravy assists characters in acclimating to

% high gravity environments. It comes in a variety of

% flavors and is often added as a sauce to food. For

% Gravy to be 100% effective, the character must begin

% using it in advance. Reduce penalties for high-gravity

% acclimation by 20. [Low]


%  Schizo: Schizo is a nanodrug that mirrors the ef-

% fects of paranoid schizophrenia. It is popular in

% some hyperelite social circles as a truly daring and

% intriguing experience. A dose of schizo looks like a

% disposable antique razor blade. Making an incision

% in the skin releases a swarm of nanobots that travel

% to the central nervous system and induce the effects

% of the drug. While in effect, the character is severely

% paranoid and hears voices. How this plays out is at

% the discretion of the gamemaster, but should include

% irrational fears, unusual compulsions based on the

% instructions of the voice or voices, and a strong pos-

% sibility that the character will behave in a violent or

% destructive fashion. The character may make WIL x 3

% Tests to avoid violent acts against objects or strangers.

% Friends and trusted acquaintances are probably less

% likely to be targets of violence (+30 modifier to avoid

% hurting people the character cares about or destroy-

% ing important possessions). Note that the character’s

% muse is unaffected by Schizo and can make efforts

% to babysit the character. Characters who take Schizo

% suffer 1d10 mental stress. [Low]

% SAMPLE PETALS
% A few examples of Petal experiences:

% FORGOTTEN HAND
% One of the character’s hands detaches and makes a
% run for it. The character is conscious and able to in-
% teract normally with the real world, but they cannot
% perceive the “escaped” hand and firmly believe that
% it’s getting away. The hand will lead the character
% a merry chase, but at some point, a new hand ap-
% pears on the character’s wrist. It may be glittery and
% opalescent, demonic and clawed, or bestial. Eventu-
% ally, after an hour or two, the character will catch up
% to their hand, but to get rid of their new hand and
% re-attach the old, they must answer cryptic questions
% posed by a gnome-like being.

% DARKLY SELVING
% This petal is believed to achieve many of its effects
% by connecting to the mesh, where an AI observes
% and controls some of the event flow, and only
% works for multiple trippers. Like Forgotten Hand,
% it works by overlaying AR perceptions on the real
% world, but because of the effects, it’s highly inadvis-
% able to take in places where any non-trippers will
% be present. Darkly Selving creates an epsilon fork
% of each character tripping and sleeves the fork in
% an infomorph that looks like a demonic version of
% themself, using visual input from the character’s
% co-trippers. AR overlays cause the characters to per-
% ceive themselves as angelic beings, while the real-
% seeming demonic infomorphs appear as AR overlays
% on their real world perceptions. What happens next
% varies, but generally both the characters and their
% forks are subjected to a series of strong chemical





% PETALS
%  Petals is a term for a type of narrative hallucinogen,
%  a nanodrug that hijacks the senses and takes the user
%  on a game-like, highly immersive trip. Known by a
%  myriad of intriguing names—Forgotten Hand, Darkly
%  Selving, Inquisitive Green, to name a few—Petals are
%  post-Fall society’s heroin—the drug of choice for the
%  desperate and fucked. Petals almost always appear as
%  nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient
%  pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing
%  the petals from the flower triggers the effects imme-
%  diately. Flowers have 5-10 petals. Multiple users may
%  share the experience if they take the Petals within 1
%  minute of the first one being plucked; after this all
%  petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent
%  white and become inert.

% Petal experiences are like entire scenarios in and of
%  themselves. Some take place entirely in the user’s mesh
%  inserts (the user must cede control of their implants

% d narcoalgorithmic stimuli, ranging from Hither-

%  ELPHINIUM SIX
%  e last and rarest in a series of petals, Delphinium
% x is the Grail of petal users, a supposedly tran-
% endental experience that might not even exist.
% elphinium One is scarce, Two and Three are quite
%  re, Four is an amazing find, and Five and Six
%  e only rumors. Hints of what Six might hold are

% sed largely on extrapolation from the little that
%  known about the lower-numbered petals. The
%  llowing facts are generally accepted. It is a group
%  perience, but not all members of the tripping
%  oup are rewarded equally. It is intensely surreal,
%  t in a purposeful way, as are all of the Delphinium
%  ries. It concludes the loosely-built narrative of a
%  ugged-out version of a fairy tale princess and her
% uest for enlightenment begun in Delphinium One,
%  plete with strange omens and mythological crea-
%  res. Rumors of what the ending might hold are
% ore fanciful, and range from the trippers being
%  sleeved in god-like infomorphs to them being
% apped forever in an ego prison. Delphinium Six is
%  mpletely virtual, leaving the characters comatose
%  r the duration, and probably lasts a long time,

% rhaps 40 hours.                                  ■





% voluntarily; if they do not, the drug has no effect other

% than producing very low-intensity LSD-like visual hal-

% lucinations), taking control of the character’s entoptic

% displays, linking to secretive mesh servers and other

% trippers, and invading the character’s sensorium with

% AR “hallucinations.” Others put the character into a

% near-comatose state during which they go on a head

% trip. Normally there is some kind of well-developed

% theme or plot to a Petal experience, although in some

% cases they just experience a stream of images.


%  Though most societies seek to suppress Petals, new

% ones appear constantly, fueled by a persistent sub-

% culture of crafters and users. Petalcrafters view their

% work as an art form (or at least as really good enter-

% tainment), and the better Petals are lovingly crafted,

% hauntingly beautiful experiences—even if they’re also

% terrifying. The subculture of Petal use ranges from

% casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-du-

% ration flower to hardcore addicts who spend much of

% %%% txt/325.txt
% their time not on Petals trying to hunt down the most
% intense and esoteric varieties. From this subculture
% comes a lot of information on what various Petals
% look like and their effects. Because Petals combine
% custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and
% sometimes connections to mesh servers, duplicating
% them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an
% active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.

% Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards,
% called “sweets” by petal users. Getting the sweets usu-
% ally requires fulfilling certain conditions within the
% trip, such as correctly answering questions or fulfilling
% goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing
% or product designs, and custom infomorph sleeves.

% On the negative side, some Petal trips go bad, in-
% flicting 1d10 mental stress or more on the user. Per-
% haps worse, some Petals are loaded with malware that
% takes over the user’s mesh inserts and worse—some
% sentinels even whisper of Petals carrying strains of the
% Exsurgent virus. [Trivial to High]

% NARCOALGORITHMS
% Narcoalgorithms are software programs that simulate
% the effects of drugs on biological bodies. Almost all
% bio, chemical, and nano drugs can be replicated as
% narcoalgorithms, with corresponding effect (game-
% master discretion). Narcoalgorithms may be run by
% infomorphs, egos encased in cyberbrains (pods and
% synthmorphs), simulmorphs, and even AIs.

% DDR: Originally crafted by prankster hackers
% and distributed as a virus, DDR (for “Dance Dance
% Robot”) triggers impulses in the target’s motor con-
% trol circuits. Primary targeting robot AIs, the effect is
% that targets “dance” in jerky, automated movements.
% Pleasure receptors are also activated so that dancing—
% and movement of any kind—feels good. Different
% software variants invoke different motions and styles.
% The target suffers a –20 modifier on other actions
% while dancing, but the dancing may be overridden
% with a WIL x 3 Test. [Low]

% Linkstate: This software actually connects the user
% to a peer-to-peer network, where it randomly con-
% nects to other linkstate users and samples a bit of their
% XP feed and randomly accessed memories—typically
% just enough to provide context, but not enough to
% acquire private personal details. These inputs are
% spliced together, their emotional inputs amplified, and
% then the entire package is spiked with some hormonal
% circuit triggers and artificial synaesthesia. The effect
% is a mind-blowing mixed sampling of people’s lives,
% mashed together in a sensory soup, that hits the mind
% with a euphoric rush. Linkstate users are catatonic
% while under the effects (typical sessions run 3-4 hours),
% but afterwards they often report that they have flash-
% backs of events in other people’s lives. [Low]

% CHEMICALS
% Atropine: Though poisonous in large doses, atropine
% is an effective antidote against nerve agents like BTX2
% and Nervex. Easily synthesized in a maker, atropine
% will avert the effect whether taken soon before or after
% dosage by a nerve agent. [Trivial]

% DMSO: This chemical acts as a carrier, allow-
% ing other chemicals to be absorbed through the
% skin. It allows any chemical agent to be applied
% dermally. [Trivial]

% Liquid Thermite: Similar to scrapper’s gel, liquid
% thermite comes in a gel form that is easily applied
% under all environmental conditions (by the nature
% of its chemical reaction, thermite is oxygenated and
% will burn underwater or in space). It is ignited with
% an electric charge, burning at temperatures exceeding
% 2,500 degrees Celsius and melting through whatever
% it is touching. Liquid thermite inflicts 3d10 + 5 DV per
% Action turn to whatever it is touching. Armor will also
% be burnt through, offering no protection once the full
% Armor rating has been reached. [Moderate]

% NotWater: NotWater is an effective liquid fire re-
% tardant that does not get objects wet, no matter how
% absorbent they are—it simply beads up and slides
% right off. [Trivial]

%  Scrapper’s Gel: This goo turns into a potent acid
% when given an electrical charge. It comes in a gel-like
% state and may be smeared like jelly, and may even be
% used in space. In acid form, scrapper’s gel does 1d10
% + 5 DV per Action Turn to anything it touches, unless
% the material has been treated against acid. Armor will
% protect against this acid at first, but the acid will eat
% through the armor, so that it will no longer protect
% after its full armor value has been reached. [Low]

%  Slip: This liquid is almost entirely frictionless. When
% spread around an area (commonly used in splash
% grenades), anyone attempting to walk or run on the
% affected surface must make a COO Test or fall down.
% Likewise, any coated surface becomes extremely
% hard to grip onto, requiring a SOM Test to hang on.
% Anyone attempting to grapple a slip-soaked character
% suffers a –30 modifier. [Low]

% Tracker Dye: This liquid is colorless at normal light
% but becomes recognizable under pre-specified different
% wavelengths (such as infrared or ultraviolet). [Trivial]

% TOXINS
% Chemical warfare involves using the toxic properties
% of biological and chemical substances to kill, injure,
% or incapacitate an enemy. Note that an antidote can
% be constructed for most toxins if a sample is acquired
% and an appropriate Medicine or Academics Test is
% made. This is considered a Task Action with a time-
% frame of 1 hour. These toxins only affect biomorphs;
% synthmorphs are immune.

% BTX : BTX-squared (also called Frog Bite) is a
% genetically-enhanced variant of the extremely potent
% cardiotoxic and neurotoxic batrachotoxin. It leads to
% fast paralysis and cardiac arrest that usually kills the
% target within a few Action Turns. Affected characters
% suffer 2d10 + 10 damage a turn for 3 Action Turns;
% medichines reduce this damage by half. They must
% also make a SOM x 2 Test (+30 with medichines) or
% be paralyzed for 1 hour. [High]

% %%% txt/326.txt

% CR Gas: This potent incapacitating agent causes
% eye twitching and temporary blindness, severe cough-
% ing and breathing difficulty, skin irritation, and panic.
% Affected characters suffer 1d10 ÷ 2 damage, a –30
% modifier to sight-based Perception Tests, and a –20
% modifier to all other actions for 20 minutes (5 min-
% utes if the character has medichines). [Low]

% Flight: This drug is derived from human pheromones
% released due to fear, and is intended to instill alarm or
% even terror in the character. Affected characters must
% make a WIL x 3 Test (+30 with medichines) or suffer
% a panic attack, inflicting 1d10 stress. Dosed characters
% also suffer a –30 modifier for resisting intimidation or
% fear-based emotional manipulations. Flight affects last
% for 1 hour (5 minutes with medichines). [Low]

% Nervex: Derived from deadly nerve agents like cy-
% closarin, VX, and novichok, this genetically-modified
% toxin is deployed as a colorless, odorless gas that
% turns safely inert 10 minutes after deployment. It
% causes involuntary contraction of the muscles, sei-
% zures, and death by respiratory failure. One minute
% after exposure, the character must make a SOM Test
% or be incapacitated by seizures, paralysis, or nausea
% and vomiting; unaffected characters still suffer a –20
% modifier to all actions. After 10 minutes, the character
% will die unless an antidote (such as atropine, p. 323) is
% applied. Characters with medichines suffer the initial
% effects, but recover after 5 minutes. [High]

% Oxytocin-A: A genetically-improved variant of oxy-
% tocin, this drug induces trust in the recipient. Drugged
% characters suffer a –30 modifier on all WIL and Kine-
% sics Tests where trust is a factor. Medichines provide
% immunity. [Low]

% Twitch: Twitch is a convulsive agent, a nonlethal
% nerve gas. Affected characters must succeed in a SOM
% Test (+30 with medichines) or become incapacitated
% with severe muscle tremors. Unaffected characters still
% suffer a –20 on all actions. The effects of Twitch last for
% 10 minutes, 5 if the character has medichines. [Low]

% NANOTOXINS
% Disruption: This nanotoxin attacks the myelin sheath
% on nerves, disrupting nerve impulses and inflicting
% symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Every hour the morph
% suffers a –5 modifier to COO, REF, and COG. If any
% aptitudes are reduced to zero,the morph is effectively
% paralyzed and catatonic. [Moderate]

% Necrosis: Necrosis nanobots attack the walls of cells
% inside the body, killing tissue. This nanotoxin inflicts
% 1d10 ÷ 2 damage per Action Turn for one minute, after
% which the nanobots disable and flush from the body.
% Necrosis only affects biomorphs. [Moderate]

% Neuropath: These nanobots are designed to stimu-
% late the pain receptors of a morph on a systemic level
% to cause agony and impairment. While most neuro-
% paths target biological receptors, variants are avail-
% able that induce comparable (phantom) pain stimula-
% tions in the cyberbrains of synthmorphs to create an
% equivalent effect. The affected character must succeed
% in a WIL x 3 Test or become incapacitated. Even if
% they succeed, they suffer –30 from the inflicted agony.
% Any form of pain resistance that allows a character
% to ignore wound modifiers will negate the neuropath
% pain modifier by an appropriate amount. [Moderate]

% Nutcracker: Nutcrackers are nanobots designed to
% locate, migrate, and decompose the synthdiamond
% case of a cortical stack within a morph by attacking
% its crystal lattice. This process takes approximately
% 6 hours, after which the cortical stack is destroyed.
% These nanobots also attack the cortical stack’s connec-
% tions to the (cyber)brain and brain-mapping nanobots.
% After 1 hour, the victim will be aware that their corti-
% cal stack is threatened. After 3 hours, all connections
% will be severed and the cortical stack will no longer be
% able to back up the character. [High]

% PATHOGENS
% A pathogen is an infectious biological agent that
% causes disease or illness to its host. While natural
% pathogens rarely strive to kill their hosts, germ war-
% fare programs revived during the Fall—or instigated
% by the TITANs—sought to modify and use pathogens
% as a weapon of war. The ideal characteristics of lethal
% biological agents are high infectivity, high potency,
% availability of vaccines, and delivery as an aerosol.
% Most biomorphs are immune to standard pathogens
% thanks to their basic bio-mods, and medichines will
% protect against most others. However, even these
% defenses may not protect against diseases left by
% the TITANs or a new terrorist cell’s biowar bug. It
% is largely recommended that pathogens be handled
% as a plot device, rather than an active threat to the
% characters. Pathogens have no effect on synthmorphs.

% Degen: Characters exposed to this degenerative
% neurological disease must make a DUR x 2 Test or
% become infected. Medichines will defeat the disease,
% but others will not show signs of infection for 1 week,
% when the symptoms of a rapidly progressing dementia
% will become clear: memory loss, personality changes,
% and hallucinations. If untreated, Degen will progress
% for another week with more serious symptoms, in-
% cluding speech impediments, jerky movements, loss
% of balance and coordination, and even seizures. This
% is reflected by a 5 point loss in all aptitudes per day
% (after the first week). When any aptitude reaches 0,
% the character dies. Degen is notorious for its effect
% in corrupting cortical stack backups before infection
% symptoms manifest. [Expensive]

% Trigger: Trigger is a designer virus that selectively
% targets and infects mast cells to trigger a hyper-allergic
% reaction. The resulting anaphylactic shock due to sys-
% temic vasodilatation (associated with a sudden drop
% in blood pressure) and bronchial swelling (resulting in
% constriction and difficulty breathing) usually leads to
% death in a matter of minutes after onset, if not treated.
% Infected characters must succeed in a DUR Test (using
% their current Durability score minus damage) or die
% quickly. Even medichines have difficulty reacting in
% time against this virus; characters with medichines
% must make a DUR x 2 Test to survive. [Expensive]

% PSI DRUGS
% Research into the Watts-MacLeod strain has resulted in
% several exceptional breakthroughs involving the creation
% of psi-impacting drugs. Each of these drugs is in the ex-
% perimental stage, but they are already finding some use
% among Firewall and similar secretive groupings.

% Inhibitor: Inhibitor is a cocktail of neurochemicals
% that block some brain receptor and transmitter func-
% tions in an attempt to reduce psi-waves and block or
% impair sleights. This drug is commonly used to restrain
% async prisoners from using their abilities. A drugged
% character must make a WIL x 2 Test. If they fail, they
% lose all psi abilities for the drug’s duration. If they suc-
% ceed, they suffer a –30 impairment on Psi skills and
% all strain is doubled. Inhibitor has an unfortunate side
% effect of doping the character down, however; apply
% a –10 modifier to their COG. Inhibitor-influenced
% characters tend to have a glazed, dopey expression and
% have difficulty getting excited or emotional. [High]

% Psi-Opener: Psi-opener drugs are variants of the
% Watts-MacLeod strain with a temporary effect and
% which do not permanently alter the user’s brain. Psi-
% opener temporarily imbues the user with the ability
% to use one particular sleight, regardless of whether or
% not they have the Psi trait. Each type of Psi-opener is
% customized for a particular sleight. While primarily
% intended for non-asyncs, non-asyncs may not possess
% Psi skills, so they must default to WIL. For this reason,
% Psi-Opener is often doubled up with Psike-out.

% Using Psi-opener is a mind-wrenching experience.
% Users are occasionally subject to hallucinations
% (gamemaster discretion). When the drug wears off, it
% inflicts 1d10 points of mental stress, +2 if the drug
% imbues a psi-gamma sleight. [Expensive]

% Psike-Out: Psike-out bolsters an async’s psi abilities.
% Apply a +20 modifier to the async’s Psi skill tests for the
% drug’s duration. However, also apply +2 to all strain
% DVs for the drug’s duration. Psike-out is mentally ad-
% dictive, with an Addiction Modifier of –10. [Expensive]



% EVERYDAY TECHNOLOGY
% The following devices are all exceptionally common
% and can be acquired in almost any habitat. Almost
% everyone in Eclipse Phase either owns these devices or
% knows several people who do.

% Ecto: Ectos are the external version of basic mesh
% inserts (p. 300), minus the medical sensors. These col-
% orful devices serve as a wearable mesh terminal, PDA,
% locator, and camera-phone. The devices are flexible
% (often worn as bracelets), dirt-resistant, self-cleaning,
% and may be stretched out to increase screen size. They
% may project holographic displays and are typically
% equipped with wireless-enabled glasses or contact
% lenses and decorative earpieces or earrings so that the
% user may access augmented reality. Given the ubiquity
% of mesh inserts, ectos are growing less common, but
% they are still used by bioconservatives, others without
% implants, and those who prefer to access the mesh via
% an external device for security concerns. [Low]

% dimensional images and movies. From a distance
% (20+ meters), such holograms can be difficult to
% distinguish as fake, but up close they are easier to
% see for what they are (+20 Perception Test modifier).
% Holograms do not appear wavelengths other than

% Micrograv Shoes: These shoes are equipped with
% velcro and/or a magnetic system, allowing the wearer
% to walk normally on appropriate surfaces in micro-
% grav and zero-G environments, rather than floating or
% bouncing. [Trivial]

% Portable Sensor: This is a small portable (possibly

% Combined sensor systems are also available, at a cu-

% Smart Clothing: Smart clothing can change its
% color, texture, and even its cut, taking only a minute
% or two to transform from a solid color jumpsuit to a
% plaid party dress or a replica of a pinstriped, late 20th
% century business suit. More advanced (and expensive)

% providing a +20 bonus to Infiltration Tests to avoid
% being seen or noticed, as long as the wearer is station-
% ary or not moving faster than a slow walk. When worn

% (p. 300), though visual displays are available for bio-
% conservatives and other characters without implants.
% Specs extend the range of the wearer’s vision from
% terahertz waves to gamma rays (p. 302). Specs in-
% clude a t-ray emitter (p. 306), however, using x-rays,
% or gamma rays for visual purposes requires a sepa-

% NANOTECHNOLOGY
% Nanotechnology is the precise manipulation of matter
% at the atomic level, typically using millions of micro-
% scale nanomachines. Nanotechnology transformed
% manufacturing, enabling new techniques and materi-
% als. The advent of nanofabrication—building objects
% from the molecular level up—transformed economies,
% allowing people to simply manufacture whatever they
% needed from raw materials. Nanotechnology is still a
% growing field, however, and has its limitations. While
% the TITANs unleashed self-replicating nanoswarms
% with the ability to transform or destroy anything
% through the power of geometric growth, such technol-
% ogy remains far beyond transhumanity’s grasp.

% BASIC NANOTECHNOLOGY
% Basic nanotechnology is exceedingly widespread
% and used throughout the solar system, serving as the
% primary method of manufacturing for decades. The
% nanobots of basic nanotech are confined to delicate
% and specially-maintained environments like the
% insides of cornucopia machines or healing vats and
% cannot operate elsewhere.

% HEALING VATS
% Healing vats were the first type of nanotech medicine
% developed and remain the most powerful medical
% devices in common use. With the exception of a few
% exceptionally deadly nanoplagues, a healing vat can
% cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as the
% patient is alive when they are place in the healing
% vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a
% scratch. A healing vat can even take a severed head (as
% long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nano-
% tech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the
% head’s genetics. If the patient’s body or medical records

%  Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require

%  to either alter the patient’s body or integrate implants
%  or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is
%  that no additional healing time is needed, the patient
%  leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation
%  and ready to go. Every hospital, clinic, bodyshop, and

%  NANODETECTORS
%  Nanodetectors are small devices that suck in air and
%  micro debris in order to scan for and detect nano-
%  bots. Given that nanobots are so small, the density of
%  nanobots in the area has a large impact on its success.
%  The nanodetector has a base skill of 30 for detecting
%  nanobots, modified by +30 if an active nanoswarm or

%  recently, and –10 for the presence of nanobots outside

% manufactured good, from a weapon to an ultralight

% plane to a hot and delicious dinner. Many nanofabri-

% cators come equipped with a library of common-use

% blueprints (basic foods, standard clothing, common

% tools, etc.). Other blueprints must either be purchased

% online, self-programmed, or acquired through some

% other method (see Nanofabrication, p. 284). The larg-

% est nanofabrication units are more than 10 meters on

% a side and are used to produce small consumer goods

% in bulk as well as building large devices like orbital

% transfer vehicles.


%  The availability and legality of nanofabricators

% varies widely throughout the system. In the inner

% system and Jovian Republic, cornucopia machines

% are commonly restricted and sometimes illegal, with

% licenses only available to hypercorps, military units,

% and other officials and elites. In these habitats, only

% more limited fabbers are available to the general

% populace. Additionally, blueprints are licensed and

% protected by copyright laws, and many nanofabrica-

% tors feature pre-programmed restrictions that prevent

% them from using unlicensed blueprints as well as

% from manufacturing weapons, explosives, or other

% restricted items. Among the autonomists of the outer

% system, however, nanofabricators are commonly ac-

% cessible, shared by everyone, and unrestricted.


%  For rules on creating goods in a nanofabricator, see

% Nanofabrication, p. 284.


%  Desktop Cornucopia Machine: Cornucopia ma-

% chines (CMs) are general-purpose nanofabricators.

% The smallest CMs are desk-sized cubes approximately

% half a meter on a side with a volume of at least 40

% liters. They can produce any small object, from tools

% to well-folded suits of clothing to handguns or a bowl

% of cereal. It is sometimes possible to assemble larger

% items, but they must be manufactured in smaller

% pieces and then assembled (likely requiring an appro-

% priate Hardware Test).

% %%% txt/330.txt

% While users can purchase bulk raw materials, CMs
% also come equipped with a disassembler. The user
% loads garbage and other objects into the disassembler
% so that they can be turned into raw materials for the
% CM. All legally-available disassemblers only decon-
% struct non-living material. [Expensive]

% Fabber: Fabbers are specialized nanofabricators,
% portable and considerably smaller than CMs. There
% are a wide variety of portable fabbers, including
% ones that can make any hand tool or small piece of
% personal electronics, ones that can turn any organic
% material into food and drink, and ones that can create
% any drug or medicine as well as bandages and spe-
% cialized dressings. The most common fabbers have a
% volume of 4 liters. Larger hand tools and devices are
% produced as 2 or 3 separate parts that must be fitted
% together. Like CMs, fabbers also contain miniature
% disposal units. [Moderate]

% Maker: Makers are specially-designed to produce
% food and drink for the user. Raw materials can be pro-
% vided by the addition of any water-containing liquid
% and collected biomass like leftover food, grass, dirt,
% dead animals, or transhuman waste. Some models are
% built into standard vacsuits. Makers can produce water
% and various flavored beverages, as well as ration bars
% or thick pudding-like edible gels. With adequate raw
% material, a maker can indefinitely provide food and
% drink for up to three transhumans. Most units, how-
% ever, have a very limited range of flavors and textures
% that are widely considered to be fairly bad. Models
% with a wider and better range of flavors and textures
% are more expensive, but produce food that is consid-
% ered adequate or occasionally good. [Low to Moderate]

% Blueprints: If you want a nanofabricator to make
% something, you need to instruct the device how to
% create it from the molecular level up. Such blueprints
% are available for almost every conceivable item out
% there. The cost of such blueprints typically equals
% the cost of purchasing the item, though factors like
% legality and quality may affect the cost as usual (see
% Acquiring Gear, p. 296). [One Cost Category Higher
% Than Item Cost]

% ADVANCED NANOTECHNOLOGY
% Advanced nanotechnology includes more recent
% developments. Like basic nanotech, advanced nano-
% technology cannot self-replicate but the nanobots
% can function normally in most environments and are
% highly resistant to bacterial attacks and other environ-
% mental problems. Typical advanced nanotech consists
% of a generator—known as a “hive”—that produces
% nanobots as long as it is supplied with raw materials.
% Every such hive also includes a miniature disassembly
% unit and/or specialized nanomachines that collect
% raw materials for the generator. These hives produce
% nanobot swarms that are set loose to perform some
% function in the world.

% Examples of advanced nanotech include COTs (p.
% 315), medichines (p. 308), smart dust (p. 316), and
% utilitools (p. 326), among others.

% General Hive: General hives are capable of produc-
% ing any conceivable type of nanobot with the right
% blueprints and/or programming. Even at their smallest
% size they are not really portable, with a minimum size
% being cubes 30 centimeters on a side and a volume of
% 25 liters. [Expensive]

% Specialized Hive: Specialized hives are far more
% common than general hives, though they can produce
% only one type of nanomachines (i.e., choose one type
% of nanoswarm per hive). The smallest specialized
% hives are approximately the size of a 12-gauge shot-
% gun shell or a large cherry tomato. [High]

% EGO BRIDGES
% Ego bridges are vat devices used for uploading and
% downloading minds. See Backups and Uploading, p.
% 268, and Resleeving, p. 271. [Expensive]

% NANOSWARMS AND MICROSWARMS
% Swarms are colonies of nanobots or larger microbots
% created in a hive, programmed with specific instruc-
% tions, and then set free to perform a set task. Each
% swarm is composed of hundreds or thousands of
% nanobots or microbots, ranging in size from a mi-
% crobe to a small insect. Nanobots are typically invis-
% ible to the naked eye, though they can be detected
% with a nanodetector (p. 326) or nanoscopic vision (p.
% 311). Microbots are more noticeable but still quite
% small, usually the size of a grain of sand or a dust
% mote, or occasionally as big as a flea. Individual bots
% in a swarm are directed by nanocomputers, with be-
% havioral routines modeled on biological insect and
% animal swarms. These swarms stick together and
% work as a whole, communicating with nanoradios,
% nanolasers, or chemical cues, and sharing informa-
% tion between each bot in the swarm. Note that nano-
% swarms don’t invade inside living bodies (though they
% may attack externally)—internal nano is handled by
% nanoware (p. 308), nanodrugs (p. 321), and nanotox-
% ins (p. 324).

% Nanobots and microbots may be designed with
% all manner of miniaturized propulsion systems (see
% Mobility Systems, p. 310), with the exception of ionic
% drives. They are powered by tiny batteries or solar
% cells. Their tiny sensors are very effective at allow-
% ing them to identify materials and objects, and so to
% target discriminatingly. Nanobots or microbots could,
% for example, be programmed to ignore metal objects,
% certain types of plants, specific morphs, females, or
% specific individuals. Swarms may either be released
% directly from a hive or from pre-packaged program-
% mable canisters.

% Swarms must be programmed before they are re-
% leased. The programming first determines how long
% the swarm is active. This timeframe is open-ended,
% though most swarms deteriorate into ineffectiveness
% after 2 weeks unless they are replenished by a hive.
% The programming then sets what area the swarm is
% to occupy. This is also open to interpretation and
% can vary from “coat this person” to “spread out to a

% %%% txt/331.txt
% diameter of 20 meters” to “find the nearest chemical
% traces and track them to their source.” Finally, pro-
% gramming sets any other parameters for the swarm’s
% mission—for example, if it should ignore certain ma-
% terials, if it should send a report at a predetermined
% time, or if it should self-destruct into harmless dust
% when it has completed a certain task.

% Programming is generally handled as a Simple
% Success Test using Programming (Nanoswarm) skill.
% Failure simply infers that the programming is imper-
% fect, and so the swarm may not operate completely as
% planned. An actual Programming (Nanoswarm) Suc-
% cess Test is only called for if the swarm’s programming
% is substantially complex or if the character seeks to
% have the swarm act outside of its usual set functions.
% The bots in each swarm are specially equipped for the
% task they are designed for, however, so attempting
% to drastically repurpose a swarm may be difficult or
% pointless at the gamemaster’s discretion.

% Swarms may also be teleoperated, controlled, and/
% or (re)programmed once they are released, via radio
% or laser link.

% Swarms are treated as a whole. The standard swarm
% size is enough to cover a 10 x 10 x 10 meter cube,
% and this is the standard “unit” of swarm released by
% a canister or hive. Swarms may be larger, but they are
% treated as individual swarm units. Each swarm has
% a Durability of 50 and is immune to wounds. Most
% attacks against a swarm simply inflict 1 point of
% damage. Area-effect weapons, plasma rifles, and fire
% inflict 1d10 damage, plasma grenades do full damage.
% Swarms are not affected by vacuum.

% Cleaners: This nanoswarm cleans, polishes, and
% removes dirt and stains. It may be used on an area,
% specific objects, or people. Some facilities employ
% permanent cleaner swarms to keep their area spotless.
% Cleaners may also be programmed to remove specific
% toxins, chemicals, or other hazardous substances in
% order to decontaminate an area. Covert operatives
% and criminals sometimes use cleaners to eliminate
% any evidence they may have left at a scene usable for
% forensics purposes, such as blood, hair, or anything
% that could be DNA-typed. [Low]

% Disassemblers: Also known as smart corrosives,
% these nanobots break down any matter. Their ad-
% vantage over common acids is that not only are
% they able to break down any material by using
% energy to disrupt chemical bonds, but that they
% can be programmed to take apart certain compo-
% nents while ignoring others, leaving them intact.
% Disassemblers are a common weapon used against
% synthmorphs, eating away their components with-
% out having to worry about accidentally splashing
% biomorphs. Upon contact, these nanobots infl ict
% 1d10 ÷ 2 damage (round up) per Action Turn. Ac-
% cumulated damage counts as a wound when the
% Wound Threshold is reached. Both Energy and Ki-
% netic armor protect against this damage, but these
% armors are eaten away as well, so the Armor Value
% is reduced by the soaked DV. [High]

% Engineers: Engineer microswarms are used for
% various construction purposes: erecting walls, digging
% tunnels, sealing holes, reinforcing foundations, and so
% on. [Moderate]

% Fixers: This is the nanoswarm version of repair
% spray (p. 333). [Moderate]

% Injectors: Injector microswarms are equipped with
% tiny needles and a drug payload. A biological target
% affected by an injector swarm suffers 1 point of
% damage and the effects of the carried drug, chemical,
% or toxin. [Moderate]

% Gardeners: This microswarm is useful for a number
% of agricultural purposes: killing weeds, planting seeds,
% trimming plants, pollinating, and even harvesting
% small items. It may also be programmed to simply
% defoliate an area. [Moderate]

% Guardians: Guardians watch for and attack other
% unauthorized swarms. Guardians inflict 1d10 ÷ 2
% damage (round up) on other swarms they come into
% contact with per Action Turn. [Moderate]

% Proteans: This nanoswarm is designed to disassem-
% ble other materials and objects and to create a single
% specific, pre-programmed device from the components
% (much like a specialized nanofabricator). The proteans
% must be able to scavenge appropriate raw materials
% (for example, to create a metallic device the nanobots
% must transform something else made of metal). The
% construction time takes 1 hour per cost category of
% the item (1 hour for a Trivial cost item, 2 hours for
% Low, etc.). [High]

% Saboteurs: Sab nanobots are designed to infiltrate
% electronics or machinery and sabotage them in small
% but difficult to discern ways: severing connections,
% disabling components, gumming up moving parts,
% etc. Saboteurs inflict damage on devices similar to
% disassemblers, but the target is not destroyed and
% such damage is not immediately obvious. They inflict
% 1d10 ÷ 2 points of damage to synthmorphs, bots, and
% other devices every Action Turn. Armor has no effect,
% but accumulated damage counts as a wound when the
% Wound Threshold is reached. [High]

% Scouts: A scout nanoswarm will system-
% atically map and explore an area, collecting
% samples of all materials and substances it
% encounters. The samples are carried back
% to the hive or canister and chemically ana-
% lyzed. Scouts can also be used for forensic
% purposes, collecting DNA samples, analyz-
% ing chemical residues, and examining other
% evidence. [High]

% Taggants: Taggants seek to lodge themselves
% onto everything in their area of dispersal.
% Each carries a unique identifier, so that if it is
% found later, the tagged person or object can
% be linked back to the point they were tagged.
% Taggants can be programmed to remain silent,
% only responding to query broadcasts made
% with the proper crypto codes, or they can be
% programmed to broadcast their location back
% to the deployer via the mesh. [Low]

% If they succeed, they are shaken but otherwise unaf-
% fected, suffering a –10 modifier to all actions until the

% SURVIVAL GEAR
% The following gear is often critical to the survival of
%  soldiers, spies, criminals, gatecrashers, emergency ser-
%  vice personnel, and others who regularly venture into
%  unsafe or unfamiliar regions.

%  Breadcrumb Positioning System: This worn device
%  leaves micro “breadcrumbs” behind as the character
%  moves. These devices interact with mesh inserts (or
%  ectos) as long as they are within range (50 meters),
%  allowing the user to map their position in relation to
%  the breadcrumb trail. This is useful in derelict habitats,
%  wilderness, and other areas where there is no local
%  functioning mesh, and is helpful both for mapping
%  and for finding one’s way back. [Low]

%  Electrogravitics Net: Also called a safety net, this fail-
%  safe system uses electric fields to counter gravity when
%  falling. While the system is not able to actually levitate
%  heavy objects, it will slow down a fall enough that the
%  user can land safely if the gravitational force is not too
%  high (the fall height is not greater than 50 meters in
% 1G). Generating these electric fields consumes a lot of
%  energy, so the net is only charged for one use only and
%  needs to be recharged afterwards. [Moderate]

%  Electronic Rope: The
%  fibers in this rope can be
%  controlled electronically,
%  making it move in a snake-
%  like fashion, stiffen up, and
%  even wrap around objects.
% Typically comes in a 50-
%  meter length capable of
%  supporting 250 kg. [Low]

%  Emergency Bubble: Com-
%  monly used as a last resort
% “life raft” on spaceships, an
%  emergency bubble is made
%  of advanced smart materi-
%  als and comes in a por-
%  table package that can be
%  quickly inflated (1 Action
% Turn) around the user, usu-
%  ally inside an airlock. The
%  bubble has a 5-meter diameter and can comfortably
%  accommodate 4 people. It maintains 1 atmosphere of
%  pressure in a vacuum, protect the inhabitants from
%  temperatures ranging from –175 to 140 C, and pro-
%  vide light, breathable air and water and food recycling
%  for up to four human-sized inhabitants, using its built
%  in maker (p. 327). It features a simple airlock, carries
%  an emergency distress beacon (below), and can be
%  transparent, opaque, or polarized. It is powered by a
%  small nuclear battery and also includes comfortable
%  inflatable furniture. [Moderate]

% %%% txt/335.txt

% Emergency Distress Beacon: This small but power-
% ful transmitter is powered by a nuclear battery and
% will broadcast any programmed distress call for years.
% Though portable and medium-sized, this beacon has
% a range of 500 km in urban areas and 5,000 km else-
% where. [Moderate]

% Flashlight: These handheld, wearable, or portable
% lights can display light in the normal visual spectrum,
% infrared, or ultraviolet, as desired. [Trivial]

% Nanobandage: Characters without medichines must
% rely on external sources of healing. The most common
% option is the nanobandage—a plum-sized advanced
% nanotechnology generator built into a reusable, self-
% sterilizing bandage. It can treat all forms of injury and
% illness, from poisoning to burns to trauma. Characters
% simply apply the bandage to the wound and let the
% nanobots do the work. It removes pain and discom-
% fort and speeds healing (see Biomorph Healing, p.
% 208). For especially severe injuries, physical first aid
% such as setting bones and removing projectiles may
% be necessary (gamemaster’s choice). If the wounds are
% too severe (the patient has suffered more than five
% wounds), the unit places the patient in medical stasis
% and radios for emergency services. [Trivial]

% Repair Spray: This nanobot generator creates
% nanobots designed to repair synthmorphs, vehicles,
% and other common objects. Repair spray contains
% the specifications and plans for almost all commonly
% used synthmorphs and devices and is a ubiquitous
% household item. If it does not contain the specifica-
% tions for something it is being used to repair, it must
% query the object’s voice for these details, otherwise it
% cannot repair it. Simply touch it to the damaged area,
% push the button on top, and it sprays out a number of
% nanobots sufficient to make repairs. These nanobots
% repair 1d10 points of damage per 2 hours. Once all
% damage is restored, the nanobots repair wounds at
% the rate of 1 per day. Repair spray also cleans and
% polishes items and returns them to a pristine and
% new state. Repair spray is not effective on any object
% with more than 3 wounds, but it provides a +30 to
% all repair rolls on anything too badly damaged for it
% to fully repair (see Synthmorph and Object Repair, p.
% 208). [Low]

% Shelter Dome: A variant of the emergency bubble,
% this package unfolds into a dome with a 2.5-meter
% ceiling and a floor 4 meters across. To safely use this
% shelter, it must be staked down to the surface it is
% placed on. [Moderate]

% Spindle: A spindle is an advanced nanotechnology
% generator that produces a super-strong cable. It can
% produce up to 2 kilometers of 0.2 millimeter diameter
% line than can support up to 250 kilograms before it
% needs more raw materials. The spindle can produce
% up to 20 meters of cable every second. It can produce
% line in a continuous length or cut the cable it produces
% to any length. Spindles can also reabsorb their cable,
% retracting it at a rate of 5 m per second. As long as
% it is recharged and has small amounts of additional
% material added every 1,000 hours of use, a spindle
% can keep producing and retracting cable indefinitely.
% By setting the maximum production speed at 10 m/
% second a character with a spindle can safely jump
% off a building and land safely, using the cable to slow
% their descent. [Moderate]

% Spindle Climber: This device attaches to a spindle
% and transforms it into a highly effective climbing
% device. The spindle climber has two functions. First, it
% attaches hardened tips to the spindle’s cable and fires
% it at high speed, up to 50 meters, with sufficient force
% to imbed the tip into almost any sufficiently durable
% surface. Second, the spindle climber can pull itself and
% up to 250 kg up the cable at a speed of up to 2 m/sec.
% A spindle climber has enough power to shoot and pull
% up the cable 50 times before it must be recharged. A
% spindle fits inside a spindle climber. [Low]

% VACUUM SUITS
% Most vacuum suits are skin-tight garments that use
% the pressure of their advanced smartfabrics on the
% wearer’s body to resist vacuum. When the wearer is in
% a breathable atmosphere, the smartfabric also loosens
% the suits to serve as ordinary clothing or be easily
% put on or taken off. In all cases, the suits can become
% skin-tight within 3 Action Turns. All vacsuits contain
% advanced rebreather units capable of maintaining a
% breathable atmosphere for several hours or days.

% Light Vacsuit: Everyone living in a sealed habitat
% owns at least one of these suits. They come in a vari-
% ety of forms. Inexpensive versions are typically light-
% weight jumpsuits made of simple smart fabric that
% adjusts to fit and folds up small enough to fit into a
% coat pocket. The best models include suits of high-end
% smart clothing that can transform into a vacsuit and
% an advanced nanotech generator the size of a large
% orange that deploy nanobots that cover the user and
% fit together into a vacuum suit. Both can transform
% into a vacsuit in 2 full Action Turns and do so either
% on command or if their sensors reveal that life sup-
% port is needed.

% All models include a lightweight belt or torc
% containing a miniature oxygen tank and advanced
% rebreather unit that provides 3 hours of air. How-
% ever, the suits contain no food or water recycling. All
% models include an ecto (p. 325) and a headlight, but
% typically little else beyond atmosphere sensors to let
% the wearer know when it is safe to take off the suit.
% They protect the wearer from temperatures from –75
% to 100 C. These vacuum suits also provide an Armor
% rating of 5/5 and instantly self-seal breaches unless
% more than 20 points of damage are inflicted at once.
% [Low, Moderate for smartfabric suits]

% Standard Vacsuit: These suits resemble light vac-
% suits made from thicker and more durable materials
% that resist tearing and provides the wearer with light
% armor. They are fitted with more substantial life sup-
% port belts that includes a maker (p. 327) capable of
% recycling all wastes and producing air for up to 48
% hours and food and water indefinitely. The best suits
% are made of smart materials that can transform from

% %%% txt/336.txt
% standard clothing to vacuum suits in a single Action
% Turn, and will do so automatically if life support is
% needed. Each suit also contains an ecto (p. 325), a
% radio booster (p. 313), and sensors equal to specs (see
% p. 325). These suits have an Armor rating of 7/7 and
% protect the wearer from temperatures from –175 to
% 140 C. They can almost instantly seal any hole unless
% more than 30 points of damage are inflicted at once.
% [Moderate, High for smartfabric suits]

% Hard Suit: This heavy-duty suit can almost be
% considered a miniature space ship. Hard Suits look
% like large metallic ovals with jointed arms and legs.
% They are quite heavy, but the user can move relatively
% easily by using servo assist motors in all the major
% joints of the arms and legs. Unlike other vacsuits, they
% are solid and can resist both vacuum and up to 100
% atmospheres of external pressure. Characters wearing
% hard suits can safely explore the upper atmosphere
% of a gas giant. They are well armored against punc-
% tures and radiation and possess miniature plasma
% thrusters capable of delivering 0.01G for 10 hours. A
% built-in high quality maker produces sufficient food,
% air, and water that a user can remain in a hard suit
% indefinitely. Explorers have used them continuously
% for up to 2 months. Their gloves incorporate smart
% materials that allow each hand to use the equivalent
% of a utilitool (p. 326). Hard suits also contain radios
% and sensors equivalent to those on standard vacsuits.
% These suits have an Armor rating of 15/15, are main-
% tained by a fixer nanohive (p. 329), and are instantly
% self-sealing of any breach unless more than 30 points
% of damage are inflicted at once. They protect the
% wearer from temperatures of –200 to 180 C. [High]



% WEAPONS
% A wide range of weapons are available in Eclipse
% Phase, from the primitive to the technologically
% advanced.

% MELEE WEAPONS
% Melee weapons are those wielded by hand (or foot) in
% melee combat. They are divided by the skill be which
% they are used.

% BLADES
% These weapons are wielded with Blades skill.

% Diamond Axe: Commonly found on many habitats
% for fire and emergency purposes, axes require two
% hands to wield. Their blades are diamond-coated for
% superior cutting ability. [Low]

% Flex Cutter: The blade of this machete-like weapon
% is made of a memory polymer. When deactivated, the
% blade is limp and flexible, and may even be rolled up
% or otherwise easily concealed. When activated, how-
% ever, the blade stiffens and sharpens into a vicious
% slashing weapon. [Low]

% Knife: A standard cutting implement, still carried
% by many. [Trivial]

% Monofilament Sword: Though swords are rather
% archaic in the time of Eclipse Phase, a few eccentrics
% take advantage of modern versions with a self-
% sharpening near-monomolecular edge, easily capable
% of slicing through metal or limbs. [Low]

% Vibroblade: These buzzing electronic blades vibrate
% at a high frequency for extra cutting ability. This
% has little extra effect when stabbing or slashing, but
% provides an extra –3 AP and +2d10 damage when
% carefully sawing through something. [Low]

% Wasp Knife: Wasp knives are equipped with a can-
% ister in their handle. The common use is to fill these
% canisters with pressured air, which inflates inside
% the target. This is potentially lethal in vacuum or
% pressurized environments (like underwater), as the
% gas bursts out of the body cavity to escape (+2d10
% damage in such situations). Wasp knives may also
% be loaded with chemicals, drugs, or nanobots. The
% target must be damaged for the canister’s contents to
% affect them. [Low]

% CLUBS
% Characters use Clubs skill when using these weapons.

% Club: Clubs encompasses a wide range of one-hand-
% ed blunt objects, from saps to sticks to pipes. [Trivial]

% Extendable Baton: This hardened composite baton
% retracts into its handle for easy carrying, storage, or
% concealment. Extending it simply requires a flick or
% an electronic signal. [Trivial]

% Shock Baton: Shock batons are standard clubs
% used for policing duties, but when activated they also
% deliver an electric shock to struck targets (see Shock
% Attacks, p. 204). [Low]

% EXOTIC MELEE WEAPONS
% Unusual weapons requires a specific Exotic Melee
% field skill to use.

% Monowire Garrote: This assassin’s weapon fea-
% tures a dangerous monomolecular wire wrapped
% around a contained spool with two handles. One
% handle grips the spool, while the other extends the
% wire so that it may be used to wrap around targets
% (typically necks or limbs) and slice through them
% when pulled. Monofilament tensile strength is weak,
% however, usually breaking after one use. [Moderate]

% UNARMED
% These weapons are wielded using Unarmed Combat skill.

% Densiplast Gloves: These gloves extra-harden when
% activated, for extra punch. [Trivial]

% Shock Gloves: When activated, these gloves deliver
% an incapacitating shock along with every punch or
% grab. Note that the effect is the same whether wearing
% one glove or two. [Low]

% %%% txt/337.txt
%  KINETIC WEAPONS
%  Kinetic weapons damage the target by firing a hard
%  impact projectile at high-velocities. Slugthrowers
%  have evolved from the mechanical firearms of the
%  early 21st century, however, and now fall into two
%  categories: chemical firearms and railguns. Though
%  their mechanisms for firing are different, they are
%  roughly similar in effect. Railguns have a higher
%  penetration and inflict more damage, which is offset
%  by more limited ammunition choices. While modern
%  beam weapons have their uses, they rarely match the
%  punch of kinetic weapons, therefore slugthrowers
%  are still perceived as the most versatile and effective
%  weapon system.

% Kinetic weapons are constructed from lightweight,
%  reinforced plastoceramic materials, which are easily
%  produced even without nanofabrication. By default,
%  modern kinetic weapons are ambidextrous but more
%  importantly feature safety and smartlink systems (p.
%  342) that automatically connect to the wielder’s mesh
%  inserts for firing assistance, target recognition, and
%  tactical networking.

% The wielder of a firearm or railgun uses Kinetic
%  Weapons skill. For information on firing modes, see
%  p. 198. For different ammunition types, see p. 336.
%  Ranges are listed on p. 203.

%  FIREARMS
%  Modern chemical firearms use caseless ammuni-
%  tion that is auto-loaded from a magazine. They are

% cally are designed in a bullpup configuration for

% close quarters operations and are ideal for tactical

% and strike teams. [Moderate]


%  Automatic Rifles: Automatic rifles use rifle ammu-

% nition and have greater range and penetration than

% SMGs. They fire in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto

% modes. They are two-handed weapons. [Moderate]


%  Sniper Rifle: Sniper rifles are optimized for range,

% BRAND NAME WEAPONS
% AND COMBINED ARMS
% The weapons listed in this book define generic
% samples of each weapon. Gamemasters are en-
% couraged to offer brand name versions of each
% weapon, each with its particular idiosyncrasies
% and small variations. For example, a Direct
% Action A30 SMG might lack a semi-automatic
% setting but come equipped with an extra ammo
% capacity of 35. Likewise, a Medusan Arms Longi-
% nus sniper rifle may inflict an extra +2 damage
% but have an AP of only –12.

% Similarly, many of the weapons listed here are
% available as combined arms weapons systems. A

% of ammunition.

% Armor-Piercing: This tungsten-carbide ammunition
% penetrates armor effectively. [Low]

% Bug: Bug rounds are equipped with a microbug and
% medical sensor nanobots. They attempt to gather in-
% formation on the target’s location (via standard mesh
% tracking), health (querying the target’s medichines),
% and surroundings (typically hindered by being inside

% in a pre-programmed manner via the mesh or a pre-
% chosen frequency band either continuously or in pre-

% Capsule: Capsule ammo carries a payload (drug,

% the round penetrates. [Trivial plus payload cost]

% Flux: Flux ammo is made from rheological materi-
% als that allow each bullet to be “programmed” so that
% they may change from regular rounds to less-lethal soft
% plastic-like rounds. This allows the firer to choose the
% type of round (regular or plastic) made with each shot
% or burst, and then change with the next one. [Low]

% Hollow-Point: Hollow-point bullets are designed to
% deform and widen once they penetrate a target, thus
% inflicting more damage. [Trivial]

% Jammer: Jammers stick to the target and pulse out
% jamming electromagnetic signals, jamming the target’s
% wireless communications. If an Opposed Test is called
% for, these devices have an Interface of 30. See Radio
% Jamming, p. 262. [Low]

% Plastic: Plastic ammo is designed to hurt but not
% wound targets, and is commonly used for crowd con-
% trol purposes. [Trivial]

% Reactive: The casing on these projectiles is made
% of reactive materials that release a large amount of
% energy when subjected to a sudden shock or impact—
% such as striking a target. In other words, they explode
% or superheat when they hit. [High]

% Reactive Armor-Piercing (RAP): This is a tung-
% sten-carbide armor-piercing round with a reactive
% casing, allowing the ammunition to penetrate even
% further. [Moderate]

% Regular Ammo: This standard metal projectile is
% designed to put holes into morphs. [Trivial]

% Splash: Splash rounds carry a payload like capsule
% ammo, but are designed to break upon impact rather
% than penetrating, splashing their contents on the
% target’s exterior. Splash rounds are typically loaded
% with paint, taggant nanobots, tracker dye, and similar
% substances. [Trivial plus payload cost]

% Zap: Zap rounds are rubber or gel bullets that
% create an electric charge upon firing in a piezoelectric
% like manner to stun the target effectively with both
% the bullet and the electric shock. [Trivial]



% SMART AMMO
% Smart ammunition takes advantage of nanotechnol-
% ogy to produce bullets that can alter their flight path,
% home in the target, and correct aim. Smart ammo may
% not be used with railguns. With the exception of biter,
% flayer, and proximity rounds, smart ammo may be
% combined with other ammo types (accushot armor-
% piercing, for example).

% Accushot: Accushot bullets change shape within
% flight to keep dead on course, countering the effects
% of wind, drag, and gravity over distance. Attacks
% made with accushot bullets ignore all range modi-
% fiers. [Low]

% Biter: Biters are specially-designed to fragment in
% opposite proportion to the hardness of the target they
% strike. For hard targets (synthmorphs), they frag-
% ment very little, blasting a big hole. For soft targets
% (biomorphs), they fragment and tumble in multiple
% directions within the body. [Low]

% Flayer: Flayers have nanosensors to detect an on-
% coming impact, shooting out monomolecular barbs
% as they are about to strike a target. These monowires
% cut through the target along with the bullet, inflicting
% additional damage. [Low]

% Homing: When fired with a smartlink system, the
% bullet identifies the target and uses nanosensors to
% lock on, correcting the bullet’s trajectory with surface
% alterations and tiny vectored nozzles. Apply a +10
% modifier to the Attack Test, cumulative with aiming
% and smartlink modifiers. Homing bullets may also be
% used for indirect fire (p. 195). [Low]

% Laser-Guided: These bullets function like homing
% smart rounds (apply the +10 attack modifier), except
% rather than requiring a smartlink system, they lock
% onto the reflection of the laser sight used to paint
% the target. Laser-guided bullets may also be used for
% indirect fire (p. 195). [Low]

% Proximity: Proximity is an explosive ammunition
% that identifies the target when fired via smartlink. If
% the round determines that it will miss the target, it will
% still explode if it reaches the close proximity of the
% target. If the attack misses with an MoF of 10 or less,
% the round explodes 1d10 meters away from the target
% and inflicts 1d10 area effect damage (see Blast Effect,
% p. 193) in the proximity of the target. [Moderate]

% Zero: Similar to homing smart rounds, zero bullets
% identify the target when fired via smartlink. Whether
% the round hits or misses, however, it sends telem-
% etry data back to the next zero bullet, allowing it to
% course-correct and “zero in” to hit the target (or hit
% more accurately). Apply a +10 modifier to each shot
% (or burst) fired after the first against the same target in
% the same Action Turn. [Low]

% BEAM WEAPONS
% Beam weapons is a broad category for a number of elec-
% tromagnetic weapons with a wide range of effects. With
% a few exceptions, energy weapons are primarily used for
% less-than-lethal purposes, designed to impair the target
% rather than kill it. Their poor performance against armor,
% lesser ability to damage targets, and high power require-
% ments make them less versatile than kinetic weapons.
% The wielders of such weapons use Beam Weapons skill.

% Beam weapons are powered by nuclear batteries.
% This battery is good for a list number of shots before
% it is depleted. Batteries may be recharged at the rate
% of 20 shots per hour.

% Laser Pulsers: Laser weapons use focused beams of
% light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it
% and causing it’s outer surface to vaporize and expand,
% creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed
% in order to bite into the target before the beam is dif-
% fused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects
% like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however—the game-
% master should reduce their effective range categories
% as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in
% the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to charac-
% ters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized
% (p. 297) and fire in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]

% One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed
% in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at
% the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by
% a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a
% flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target.
% This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius.
% Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2

% %%% txt/341.txt
%  Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with
%  any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target
%  is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses
%  their next action. A critical failure means the target
%  is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per
%  10 points of MoF. In this stun setting, the pulser fires
%  only in single-shot mode.

%  Microwave Agonizer: The agonizer fires millimeter-
%  wave beams that create an unpleasant burning sen-
%  sation in skin (even through armor) and to metals.
%  Agonizers have two settings. The first is an active
%  denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the
%  target, inflicting –20 to the target’s actions and forc-
%  ing them to move away from the beam on their next
%  action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with
%  Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer
%  a –10 modifier and roll WIL x 2). Synthetic morphs
%  and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the
%  equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second
%  setting (colloquially known as the “roast” setting) has
%  the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the
%  target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally devel-
%  oped for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for
%  repelling animals. The agonizer is small-sized (p. 297)
%  and fires in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]

%  Particle Beam Bolter: This weapon shoots a bolt of
%  accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer
%  massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, su-
%  perheating and creating an explosion when striking.
%  The bolter’s beam is not diffused by the cloud that
%  occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetra-
%  tion than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not
%  affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter’s beam is
%  invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either
%  atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation,
%  and will not function in the opposite environment
%  (though bulkier dual models, combining both models,
%  are also available). Bolters fire in semi-auto mode and
%  are rifle-sized two-handed weapons. [High]

%  Plasma Rifle: This bulky, heavy, two-handed
%  weapon blasts a stream of nova-hot plasma at the
%  target, inflicting severe burns and thermal damage,
%  possibly melting or evaporating the target entirely.
%  Plasma rifles are perhaps the deadliest man-portable
%  weapons in use. Plasma guns suffer from dangerous

%  Seekers are a combination of automatic grenade

%  rounds are fired at high-velocity via rings of magnetic

%  coils, after which the micromissile or minimissile uses

%  scramjet technology to propel itself and maintain high

%  velocities over great distances. Seekers are wielded

%  using Seeker Weapon skill.


%   Seeker missiles are detailed on p. 340. Like gre-

%  nades, seekers may be programmed for a variety of

%  SPRAY WEAPONS
%  Spray weapons blast their ammunition outwards in a
%  widening cone, allowing them to strike several targets
%  at once. These weapons are wielded with Spray Weap-
%  ons skill. Spray weapon ammunition has a flat cost
%  of Low per 100 shots (with the exception of buzzers,
%  which use nanoswarms).

%  Buzzer: Equipped with a specialized nanobot hive,
%  Buzzers are used to spray a nanoswarm (p. 328) on a
%  target or area. They have a limited capacity of swarms,
%  though the nanohive can construct one new swarm
%  each hour. This weapon is two-handed. [Moderate]

%  Freezer: Freezers spew out a fast-hardening foam
%  that immediately begins to harden. They are primar-
%  ily used as a non-lethal method of immobilizing or
%  securing a target. Struck characters must immediately
%  make a REF x 3 Test or become trapped. Apply a –30
%  modifier to this test if the attacker scored an Excel-
%  lent Success (MoS 30+). The foam allows characters
%  to breath even if their mouth and nose are covered,
%  but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked
%  with contact toxins or drugs to additionally sedate
%  the target. It can also be used to construct temporary
%  barricades or cover. Hardened foam has an Armor of
%  10 and Durability of 20. It slowly breaks down and
%  degrades over a 12 hour period. Freezers are two-
%  handed. [Moderate]

%  Shard Pistol: The shard pistol is a flechette weapon,
%  firing a stream of of diamondoid monomolecular
%  shards at high velocities. These micro flechettes are
%  very good at penetrating armor, but they do not dis-
%  perse kinetic energy well and so do not cause as much
%  tissue damage as kinetic weapons. Shard ammunition
%  is often coated with drugs or toxins for extra effi-
%  ciency. [Low]

%  Shredder: A heavier version of the shard pistol,
%  the shredder fires a larger cloud of lethal flechettes,
%  enough to shred a portion of the target into a fine
%  mist. [Moderate]

%  GRENADES AND SEEKERS

% Grenades and seeker missiles come in similar muni-

% tions packages and with similar trigger mechanisms,

% though their packaging, physical form, and methods

% of application differ. Seeker missiles are fired from a

%  seeker launcher (p. 339) using Seeker Weapons skill.

% Grenades are thrown at targets using Throwing Weap-

% ons skill. If a grenade or seeker misses, use the rules

% for scatter (p. 204).


%  Grenades are available in standard form or as

% microgrenades. Similarly, missiles are available in

%  standard, minimissile, or micromissile sizes. Standard

%  grenades and minimissiles are the baseline standard

% for listed effects. All are area effect weapons (p. 193).

% Minigrenades and micromissiles inflict –1d10 damage

% (or have another decreased effect as noted). Standard

% missiles double the listed DV. For weapons with a

% unfirom blast effect or other static blast area, divide

% the base listed radius in half for minigrenades and mi-

%  costs are for 10 grenades/missiles.


%  Each seeker has one smart ammo option (p. 338)

% other than biter or flayer.


%  Concussion: These devices emit a concussive blast

% designed to knock opponents off their feet and stun

% them. Any character caught within a base blast radius

% of 10 meters must make a SOM x 2 Test. If they fail,

%  ditions (wind, rain, etc.) [Low]

%  High-Explosive: High-explosive seekers and gre-
%  nades are designed to create a very destructive shock
%  and heat wave. This damage is resisted with energy
%  armor. [Moderate]

%  High-Explosive Armor-Piercing (HEAP): A design
%  only available for seekers (not grenades), HEAP
%  warheads use high explosives to blast a path for
%  a penetrating round. HEAPs lose –4 damage per
%  meter distance from the blast, as opposed to the
%  usual –2. [Moderate]

%  Overload: Overload grenades and seekers launch an
%  all-out assault on the target’s sensory spectrum. This
%  attack includes blinding by intense flashing light, a
%  deafening thunderclap followed by intense ultrasonic
%  screaming, nausea-inducing malodorants, and infra-
%  sonic frequencies that can trigger unpleasant emotion-
%  al responses (anxiety, uneasiness, extreme sorrow, ner-
%  vous feelings of revulsion or fear). For an extra kick,
%  overloads are also packed with “stingballs”—rubber
%  pellets that inflict pain when detonated near an under-
%  armored target. Anyone caught in the base 10-meter
%  blast radius must make a SOM + WIL Test. If they fail,
%  they must immediately leave the area of effect. If they
%  fail with an MoF of 30+, they are incapacitated for

% utilize a more deadly form of explosion. When they

% detonate, they disperse a cloud of aerosol explosive

% WEAPON ACCESSORIES
% The following accessories are available for various
% weapons.

% Arm Slide: This slide-mount can hold a pistol-
% sized weapon under a character’s sleeve, pushing the
% weapon into the character’s hand with an electronic
% signal or specific sequence of arm movements. [Low]

% Extended Magazine: This ammunition case has
% an increased capacity. Increase the weapon’s ammo
% capacity by +50%. Only available for firearms and
% seekers. [Low]

% Gyromount: This weapon harness features a gyro-
% stabilized weapon mount that keeps the weapon steady.
% Negates all modifiers from movement. [Moderate]

% Imaging Scope: Imaging scopes attach to the top of
% the weapon and act like specs (p. 325). Scopes may
% also bend like a periscope, along a character to point
% the weapon and target around corners without leav-
% ing cover. [Low]

% Flash Suppressor: This device obscures the muzzle
% flash on firearms, applying a –10 modifier on Percep-
% tion Tests to locate a firing weapon by its flash. [Low]

% Laser Sight: This underbarrel laser emits a beam
% that places a glowing red dot on the target to assist
% targeting. Apply a +10 modifier to Attack Tests (not
% cumulative with a smartlink modifier). Laser sights
% may also be used to paint a target for laser-guided
% smart ammo or seekers. Infrared and ultraviolet lasers
% are also available, so that the dot is only visible to
% characters able to see in those spectrums. [Low]

% Safety System: A biometric (palmprint or voice-
% print) or ego ID (p. 279) sensor is embedded in the
% weapon, disabling it if anyone other than an autho-
% rized user attempts to fire it. [Low]

% Shock Safety: Just like a safety system, except that
% an unauthorized user is zapped with an electric shock.
% Treat as a shock baton (p. 334). [Moderate]

% Silencer/Sound Suppressor: This barrel-mounted
% accessory reduces the sound of a firearm’s discharge.
% Apply a –10 modifier on hearing-based Perception
% Tests to hear or locate the gun’s firing. [Moderate]

% Smartlink: A smartlink system connects the weapon
% to the user’s mesh inserts, placing a targeting bracket
% in the character’s field of vision and providing range
% and targeting information. Apply a +10 modifier to
% the Attack Test. Smartlinks also incorporate a micro-
% camera that allows the user to see what the weapon
% is pointed at, fire around corners, etc. Smartlinks also
% allow certain other types of weapon system control,
% such as changing flux ammo (p. 337) or programming
% seeker trigger conditions (p. 199). [Moderate]

% Smart Magazine: A smart magazine allows the
% character to pick and choose what ammo round will
% be fired with each shot. This system leaves less room
% for bullets, however, so reduce the weapon’s ammu-
% nition capacity by half (round up). Smart magazines
% may be combined with extended magazines, in which
% case ammo capacity is normal. [Moderate]

% ROBOTS AND VEHICLES
%  The following is a small selection of the many vehicles
%  in use in the solar system. Almost all of the vehicles
%  in current use, including all of the vehicles listed here,
%  have built-in AIs capable of piloting the vehicle under
%  almost all circumstances. In most cases, passengers
%  simply state their destination and the vehicle takes
%  them there. Manual piloting is primarily used in
%  emergencies or by people who prefer the exotic thrill
%  of controlling their own vehicle.

% Rules for handling robots and vehicles are detailed
%  on p. 195. Any of these shells may be modified for use
%  as a synthetic morph by adding a cyberbrain system
%  (p. 300). Each of the shells listed here comes with a
%  puppet sock (p. 307) for remote-control operation.


% AIRCRAFT
%  On Mars, Venus, and within large open-space habitats
%  like O’Neil cylinders, aircraft of various kinds see regular
%  use. This includes modern version of rotorcraft (helicop-
%  ters, autogyros, tilt-rotors), fixed-wing planes, and zep-
%  pelins and other lighter-than-air craft. These are typically
%  propelled by turbofan or jet engines, rotors, or vectored
%  thrust. These vehicles are piloted with Pilot: Aircraft skill.

%  Microlight: This ultra-light personal aircraft is
%  not much more than a strut-based wing, an airframe,
%  and an electric propeller engine. They are ideal for
%  getting around inside large habitats with enclosed
%  airspace. [Low]

%  Portable Plane: Powered by superconducting bat-
%  teries and with an exceedingly small but powerful
%  electric motor, this light but durable propeller plane
%  is made of smart materials that allow it to be swiftly
%  folded up into a small portable package. Different ver-
%  sions are designed for flight on Mars, Titan, or Venus,
%  each taking 10 minutes to assemble or disassemble.
%  The Martian version unpacks into an airplane with a
%  wingspan of 11 m with a top speed of 250 kph and a
%  cruising speed of 220 kph and a range of 1,300 km.
%  The Venusian version has a wingspan of 9 m, a top
%  speed of 200 kph and a range of 1,000 km. The ver-
%  sion designed for use on Titan has a wingspan of 8
%  m and has a top speed of 200 kph and a range of
%  2,000 km. In all versions, the two occupants ride in
%  an inflatable and insulated pressurized bubble with a
%  life support system capable of providing clean air and
%  comfortable temperatures for 20 hours on Mars and
%  Venus, and 15 hours on Titan. [High]

%  Rocket Buggy: This vehicle is the most common

% form of medium to long distance personal transport

% on Luna, and is in common on most other moons

% and large asteroids. On these airless worlds, a rocket

% buggy can reach orbit and return or take a parabolic

% path to any destination on that moon in less than

% an hour. This vehicle is also regularly used to travel

% between habitats that are less than 30,000 km apart.

% The vehicle is pressurized, but is designed for short

% duration travel only. The seats are relatively small

% and the life support system contains no provisions

% for recycling food or water and can only support the

% passengers for an absolute maximum of 50 uncom-

% fortable hours. Rockets buggies come equipped with

% headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of

% up to 250 km.


% A version of this vehicle is also used on both Mars

% and Titan, but here the frame has been modified to

% act as a lifting body, and it has a top speed in the thin

% Martian atmosphere of 2,500 km/hour and a range

% of 8,000 km on Mars. On Titan is has a top speed

% of 3,000 kph in the atmosphere, but it can also reach

% orbit. [Expensive]


%  Small Jet: Methane-powered jet planes are one of

% the most common forms of fast transport on Mars

% and Venus. Similar planes are used on Titan, except

% that they carry both liquid methane and liquid oxygen.

% These jets range in size from huge vehicles the size of

% late 20th-century airliners to small planes designed to

% carry half a dozen passengers. All jets are made using

% smart materials, so that their wings and frames can

% adapt to a wide range of speeds and altitudes. One

% common small jet has similar versions in use on Venus,

% Mars, and Titan, has a single jet engine and has a life

% support system capable of providing air for up to 100

% hours. The Venusian and Martian versions both have

% a top speed of 900 kph, a wingspan of 11 m, and a

% maximum range of 5,000 km. The version designed

% for Titan has a wingspan of 8 m, a top speed of 650

% kph, and a range of 4,000 km. Jets are equipped with

% headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of

% up to 250 km. [Expensive]

% Battle Suit: The battle suit powered exoskel-
% eton features a military-grade fullerene armor shell
% with flexible aerogel for thermal insulation and a
% diamond-hardened exterior designed to resist even

% also enhances the wearer’s strength and mobility, ap-
% plying a +10 bonus to strength-based tests, inflicting
% an extra +1d10 damage and AP of –2 on melee at-
% tacks, and doubling the distance by which the char-
% acter may jump. Battlesuits are completely sealed to
% protect the wearer from environmental factors, and
% fitted with life support features and a maker (p. 327)
% capable of recycling all wastes and producing air
% for up to 48 hours and food and water indefinitely.
% Battle suits are equipped with each an ecto (p. 325),
% a radio booster (p. 313), and sensors equal to specs
% (see p. 325). These suits have an Armor Value of
% 18/18 (not cumulative with any other armor) and
% protect the wearer from temperatures from –175 to

% Exowalker: Exowalkers are minimal framework
% exoskeletons, primarily designed to bolster the
% wearer’s strength and movement. They provide a an
% Armor Value of 2/4, a +10 modifier to strength-based
% tests, and double the distance by which the character
% may jump. [Moderate]

% Hyperdense Exoskeleton: These powered exoskel-
% etons are larger (roughly twice human-sized) and built
% for heavy-use industrial purposes, such as handling
% heavy/large objects. The wearer is partially encapsulated
% to protect them from debris and industrial accidents.
% Hyperdense exoskeletons provide no movement bonus,
% but provide a +30 bonus to strength-based tests and
% inflict an extra +3d10 damage and –5 AP on physical
% attacks. They have an Armor Value of 6/12. [Expensive]

% Transporter: This exoskeleton framework includes
% a pair of vector-thrust turbofan engines, giving the

% GROUNDCRAFT

% In Eclipse Phase, trains and bicycles remain the most

% common form of ground transportation, especially on

% habitats. In larger habitats and on moons and planets,

% cycles and cars are used as well.


% Cycle: Because of the high cost of enclosing a habi-

% tat and providing life support, space is at a premium

% in all cities except some of the newest cities on Mars.

% As a result, there is rarely room for large roads or the

% cars that once carpeted the roads of Earthly cities.

% Instead, the ubiquitous modern vehicle is the cycle,

% which is designed to drive down narrow streets only a

% little wider than sidewalks in Earth cities.


% There are many different varieties of cycle. Some

% have only a single wheel and are gyro-stabilized, but

% most have two wheels and resemble old Earth motor-

% cycles. In some, the driver and passenger are enclosed

% by a streamlined pod. These vehicles are powered

% by superconducting batteries, have a range of 600

% km and a top speed of 120 kph, but must usually

% drive more slowly in crowded streets. Cycles are all

% equipped with radio boosters, headlights, and a por-

% table radar sensor. Tires are solid state (not inflated),

% or in some cases smart spokes capable of handling

% stairs. Some luxury versions have limited life-support

% in the small cabin, capable of providing air for the

% passengers for up to 10 hours. [Moderate]


% Mars Buggy: One of the most ubiquitous vehicles

% on Mars is the so-called Mars buggy, a four-wheeled

% vehicle with large balloon tires that is designed for

% use both on roads and on almost any terrain. Mars

% buggies can travel at speed of up to 110 kph on roads,

% 90 kph over relatively flat terrain, and up to 40 kph

% on jagged and rocky terrain. They can maintain these

% speeds because smart materials in both the suspension

% and the tires reshape themselves to adapt to uneven

% conditions and their nuclear batteries give them an

% effectively unlimited range. Most Mars buggies are

% enclosed but unpressurized. Similar vehicles are used

% on Luna and Titan, however, though the passenger

% compartments of these vehicles includes life support

% Rocket Pack: This is a miniature metallic hydrogen
%  rocket that the wearer straps to their back, with two
%  rocket exhausts extending out to either side, away
%  from the wearer’s body or legs. Biomorphs and pod
%  morphs can only safely use this vehicle when wear-
%  ing a vacuum suit or some garment that is similarly
%  heat resistant. Also, to prevent harm to the wearer, the
%  thrust must be kept sufficiently low that it can only
%  take off on Mars or moons with even lower gravity. A
%  rocket pack can keep the wearer airborne for up to 15
%  minutes in Mars gravity, or 30 minutes on Luna, Titan,
%  or any of the four large Jovian moons. On Mars, it
%  has a maximum speed of 700 kph. It can be used to
%  reach orbit and land again on Luna, Titan, and other
%  similarly small bodies like the Jovian moons. Rocket
%  packs are equipped with radio boosters but no other
%  sensors or communication devices. [Low]

% Thruster Pack: Worn for EVA duties, this thruster
%  pack uses vectored thrust nozzles, allowing a charac-
%  ter to maneuver in open space. This is not a jetpack
%  and does not produce enough thrust for atmospheric
%  movement. [Low]

% SPACECRAFT PROPULSION
% The most important part of any spacecraft is its engine,
% and the most important features of any engine are
% the exhaust velocity, which determines how much
% fuel the rocket requires to reach a given speed, and
% the engine’s thrust, which determines how high the
% acceleration can be. Any rocket that has a thrust of
% less than approximately twice the gravity of a planet
% or moon cannot take off from that planet or moon.
% Sample thrusts and gravities are listed on the Escaping
% Gravity Wells table, p. 346.

% Hydrogen-Oxygen Rocket (HO): Though opti-
% mized with improved engine design and light-weight
% materials, these are essentially the same primitive
% rockets that humanity used to first reach the moon
% in the 20th century. These are rarely used and only
% common with groups too poor or primitive to safely
% manufacture metallic hydrogen.

% Metallic Hydrogen Rocket (MH): Metallic hydro-
% gen is a solid form of hydrogen created using exceed-
% ingly high pressures. Although naturally unstable, it
% can be stabilized with carefully controlled electrical
% and magnetic fields, and these field generators are
% an integral part of every metallic hydrogen fuel tank.
% By selectively reducing these fields near the exhaust
% nozzle, small amounts of metallic hydrogen can be
% made to swiftly and explosively revert to conventional
% hydrogen gas, propelling the rocket with great force

% Plasma Rocket (P): This drive heats hydrogen into
% plasma and accelerates it using a powerful electrical
% field. This type of rocket was very common in the
% mid 21st century, but has been superseded by fusion
% rockets and is only used in older and more primitive
% spacecraft, notably scum barges.

% Fusion Rocket (F): Similar to a plasma rockets,
% fusion rockets require significantly higher tempera-
% tures and pressures, and the rocket also produces
% large amounts of power for the spacecraft. Fusion
% rockets are now the most common form of propul-
% sion for spacecraft designed for long-distance voyages.

% Anti-Matter Rocket (AM): Anti-matter rockets
% work mixing small amounts of anti-matter into the
% hydrogen fuel, producing enormous amounts of
% energy and an exceptionally fast and powerful ex-
% haust. These rockets typically carry a heavily shielded
% magnetically contained anti-matter storage vessel car-
% rying a mass of anti-matter equal to 1% of the mass
% of the hydrogen fuel used by the rocket. The magnetic
% containment vessels needed to safely contain anti-
% matter usually weight at least 10 times the mass of
% the antimatter used.

% Though anti-matter storage is exceptionally safe,
% the vast energy release possible if there was an ac-
% cident means that anti-matter rockets are forbid-
% den from coming closer than 25,000 km from any
% inhabited planet or moon. Also, very few habitats
% will allow an anti-matter rocket to dock with them,
% and instead require the spacecraft to remain at least
% 10,000 km away and for all cargo and passengers to
% be transferred using a small craft like a small LOTV.
% Anti-matter is exceedingly expensive to produce and
% so anti-matter rockets are only used in military vessels
% and in fast couriers designed to carry critical cargoes
% across the solar system in short periods of time.

% SAMPLE SPACECRAFT
% The following is a representative sample of the most
% common type of spacecraft used in the solar system today.

% Bulk Carrier: This vessel is simply a standard
% transport refitted to carry large amounts of cargo in
% external cargo grapples. Used for carrying refined ores,
% ice, and similar forms of large, useful, but low priority
% cargos, bulk carriers transport large cargos at rela-
% tively low velocities. They also offer an inexpensive,
% reliable, and slow method for passengers to travel
% from one habitat to another and are not infrequently
% used by individuals who wish to disappear for a while.
% Unlike the standard transport, the bulk carrier lacks
% the rotating habitat pods.

% Courier: In a standard transport, a typical journey
% from Luna to Mars requires approximately three
% weeks, while a journey from Mars to Jupiter requires
% approximately four months. This is sufficient for most
% purposes, but occasionally characters need to take
% themselves or sufficiently valuable cargoes across the

% %%% txt/350.txt
%  solar system in a matter of days or weeks, instead of
%  weeks or months.

%  Anti-matter drive fast couriers are vessels de-
%  signed for this specific purpose. This vessel can
%  travel from Venus to Mars in a week and from
%  Mars to Jupiter in a month. The fast courier is the
%  swiftest vessels currently made and is able to reach
%  at much as one half of one percent of the speed
%  of light. To manage this, this spacecraft must also
%  carry 6 tons of antimatter in a 100 ton magnetic
%  containment vessel. In an emergency, this contain-
%  ment facility can be jettisoned.

%  Destroyer: One of the largest military spacecraft
%  in common use, destroyers use an antimatter drive
%  holding 150 tons of antimatter in a 2,000-ton mag-
%  netic containment vessel. This antimatter can also
%  be used to provide the spacecraft’s missiles with
%  anti-matter for devastatingly powerful anti-matter
%  warheads. This spacecraft is also armed with
%  railguns, nuclear and high explosive missiles, and
%  point defense lasers.  In addition, all destroyers
%  carry a contingent of 20 fighters.

%  Fighter: This small, short range military vessel is de-
%  signed to be crewed by an infomorph or AI. If needed,
%  however, it can hold a single synthmorph or vaccum-
%  adapted biomorph as a pilot. It carries 3 lasers and 2
%  railguns mounted on small pods placed around the
%  middle of ship that can fire in any direction. A single
%  missile launcher is located in the nose of the fighter
%  and typically holds 6 small high explosive missiles or
%  tactical nuclear missiles (or even anti-matter missiles
%  if facing high-threat targets).

%  General Exploration Vehicle (GEV): A GEV is one
%  of the standard vehicles used for exploration beyond
%  the Pandora Gates. It is specifically designed to handle
%  almost any environment. It is a boxy vehicle, 6 meters
%  long, 2.2 meters wide, and 2 meters high. It makes
%  extensive use of smart matter in the lower part of the
%  chassis, and can create wheels or short legs (primar-
%  ily useful for exceedingly rough terrain). It can even
%  produce limited hull streamlining and propulsion

%  (wheeled)/40 (walker)/60 (sea)/40 (submerged).

%  The GEV also has a closed cycle life support system
%  that can support up to 6 (fairly cramped) living
%  occupants for up to one month and limited electro-
%  magnetic shielding against charged particle radiation.
%  All models are fitted with advanced AI piloting and

%  trum cameras.

%  Large Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (LLOTV):
%  This common vehicle is used for transporting passen-
%  gers and cargo between a planet or moon and orbit
%  and for short distance transfers between habitats
%  less than 100,000 km apart. This conical vehicle has
%  a curved heat shield on the base and smart material
%  landing legs and grapples so that it can rest securely
%  on any stable terrain and link up with all forms of
%  docking clamps. It comes in variants designed to use
%  either a hydrogen-oxygen chemical rocket or a me-
%  tallic hydrogen rocket. The use of light-weight smart
%  materials allows the interior to be easily and rapidly
%  reconfigured to accommodate different amounts of
%  fuel, passenger seats, and cargo space. LLOTVs that
%  are not designed for planetary landing or which are
%  designed only to land on airless moons are unstream-
%  lined and look considerably blockier.

%  LLOTVs come in two configurations: high or low
%  velocity. High velocity configuration allows the vehicle
%  to land and take off again on Venus or Earth without
%  refueling and for rapid transport between nearby
%  habitats. Low velocity configuration is designed to
%  land and take off again on Mars or various large
%  moons without refueling and for slower and more
%  fuel efficient transport between nearby habitats. The
%  extensive use of smart materials in this vehicle means

% be easily converted between the high and low velocity

% Scum Barge: These huge craft were originally de-
% signed for use during the first stages of the evacuation
% of Earth. They were built to carry up to 20,000 people
% and to allow them to survive for months or even years,
% in relatively cramped conditions, until more suitable
% habitats could be constructed. A number of these ves-
% sels are still in service, primarily used as mobile habi-
% tats by various anarchic subcultures. The best have
% had their plasma rockets replaced by modern fusion
% rockets and carry 5-10,000 in relative comfort. The
% worst use aging plasma rockets and stretch their life
% support systems and living spaces to the limit, carry-
% ing up to 25,000 poor and desperate residents.

% Small Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (SLOTV):
% This vehicle is identical in use and design to the
% LLOTV, except that it is one third the total mass and
% correspondingly less expensive to build and refuel.
% Some exceptionally wealthy individuals own private
% small LOTVs. Using a small LOTV with a hydrogen-
% oxygen engine to take off and land on Venus or for
% other high velocity uses is exceptionally cramped
% and allows for absolutely no room for error. Like the
% LLOTV, this vehicle can be easily converted between
% low and high velocity configurations and is made in
% both streamlined and non-streamlined versions.

% Standard Transport: This vessel is one of the most
% common freighter and passenger vessel in the solar
% system. While egocasting is by far the most common
% form of inter-habitat transport, some people prefer to
% travel by ship and others do not wish to leave their
% current morph behind. In addition, some goods are
% easier or cheaper to physically transport rather than
% duplicating their templates. As a result, standard
% transports regularly travel to and from every large
% habitat and inhabited planet and moon in the solar
% system. These are modern fusion-drive ships that offer
% fast and comfortable travel for passengers as well as
% relatively swift transport for small cargoes.

% One of the additional benefits of the standard
% transport is the fact that it contains four separate pas-
% senger compartments, each of which is mounted on
% a 90 meter-long booms that can extend and rotate
% to simulate gravity. When rotating at a comfortable 2
% rpm, passengers experience Mars level gravity. Typi-
% cally, the gravity maintained in these pods starts at
% the local gravity (or Mars gravity, if the local gravity
% is higher) and over the course of the journey gradually
% increases or decreases to the gravity of the destination.

% SECRETS THAT MATTER

% There are secrets woven all through the real history of

% the 21st century, and the present, and therefore all pros-

% pects for the future. These are the pieces of information

% that never make it into a habitat’s mesh at all. Some of

% it is unknown to transhumanity. Some is known only

% to a select few transhumans who carefully ensure that

% it does not leak out of their control. Some is known to

% wider conspiracies, such as Firewall, but is kept out of

% the public eye for reasons of security and safety. These

% secrets can be dangerous to those who know them.

% Those who have stumbled across them have died for

% their knowledge, have erased their own memories (or

% had them erased by others), or have hidden themselves

% someplace other people never go, to avoid dealing with

% the consequences of such knowledge.


% The information provided in this section is available

% for characters to discover and, one way or another,

% to confront them, giving gamemasters the tools they

% need to provide their players with fresh challenges and

% opportunities. Every secret contains the possibility of

% great reward and of greater trouble, usually bundled

% together. Nothing here was just forgotten or lost out

% of carelessness. It was hidden by someone who wanted

% to keep it away from someone (or everyone) else.

% Every secret the characters learn inserts them into a

% new web of other people’s complications—a potential

% source for drama and conflict in your campaign.


% EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCES

% to be 13.2 billion years old—almost as old as the

% homo sapiens humans evolved approximately a mere

% 400,000 years ago. Against the backdrop of the ga-

% lactic calendar, transhumans are nascent arrivals on

% the scene; newborns in every sense of the word. More

% importantly, transhumans are uninvited guests in what

% other, older intelligences think of as their assets.


%     For years, humans scientists have struggled with

% the Fermi Paradox, which questions why no evidence

% of alien life has yet been found—such as spacecraft,

% transmissions or probes—despite the mathematical

% likelihood that a multitude of advanced extraterrestrial

% civilizations should exist in the Milky Way. One postu-

% lation says that there must be some sort of unknown

% “Great Filter”—an event that all intelligence encounters

% in its development that for whatever reason such life

% cannot surpass. In other words, an extinction event.

% Some worried that the development of dangerous

% technologies—nuclear weapons, nanotechnology, etc.—

% before a civilization had matured could be the Great

% Filter. Others worried that it could be a technological

% singularity event, such as the TITANs and the Fall.


%     In fact, alien races do exist, and they have been

% around for far, far longer than transhumanity. New

% ones, however, are simply rare, as few have managed

% to elude destruction at the hands of the ETI.


%     The ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) is the civi-

% lization that dominates galactic life in Eclipse Phase.

% The ETI is incredibly old and powerful—a Type III or

% even Type IV civilization on the Kardashev scale. It is

% capable of megascale engineering projects and enjoys

% an understanding of physics, matter, energy, and uni-

% versal laws that makes all of transhuman knowledge

% seem insignificant in comparison. Most likely, the ETI

% itself evolved from some sort of artificial intelligence

% singularity event in its own past, ascending to a god-

% like level of super-intelligence. It may no longer be

% recognizably biological.


%     This ETI has seeded the galaxy with a type of

% self-replicating probes known as bracewell probes.

% %%% txt/355.txt
% THE ETI AGENDA
% The nature of the ETI and its agenda is one of the
% great mysteries of Eclipse Phase. This potent alien
% civilization has had a direct hand in manipulating
% transhumanity’s existence and future, yet it is likely
% that characters in this game will never encounter
% these entities directly or discover the meaning
% behind what they have done. As transhumanity
% expands outwards into the galaxy, however, it is
% possible and even likely that they will find other
% evidence of the ETI’s activities and influence, un-
% doubtedly raising even more questions.

% Ultimately the ETI’s nature and goals are in the
% gamemaster’s hands. There are many possibilities
% to be explored, and some may fit the intentions of
% your gaming group more than others. A few pos-
% sible scenarios and explanations are noted below,
% but gamemasters are encouraged to develop their
% own variations.

% SECURITY
% In this scenario, the ETI’s intent is to maintain its
% dominant position as the most intelligent and
% powerful entity in its light cone. It uses the Exsur-
% gent virus to wipe out any emerging singularities—
% and the civilizations that spawned them—merely
% to protect its own self-interest. Though mere
% transhumans are a trifling nuisance, anything
% resembling a self-improving super-intelligence is
% targeted for annihilation.

% THE AGGRESSION FILTER
% The ETI does not seek to wipe out emerging intel-
% ligences, but it does act as an evolutionary force.
% In this case, the Exsurgent virus is used as a tool
% to neutralize any aggressive, hyper-evolving forms
% of intelligent life, thus encouraging the evolution
% of more careful, subtle, slow-growing, observant,
% and exploratory species. In other words, the ETI
% seeks to weed out traits that could be considered
% dangerous or threatening, acting as a sort of ga-
% lactic domestication program.




% These probes lie dormant in every star system, pa-
% tiently waiting and monitoring for millennia for signs
% of intelligent life—but not just any signs. In particular,
% these probes are designed to watch for signs of emerg-
% ing singularity-level machine intelligence. The probes
% are in fact traps, designed to lure such seed AI intel-
% ligences in and then infect them.


% The reason for this infection remains unknown
% (see The ETI Agenda), but it is a pattern that has
% played itself out around the galaxy with uncounted
% alien civilizations. New life evolves, creates technol-
% ogy, develops something akin to seed AI, and then
% bam!—the seed AIs find the probes, become infected,
% DIVERSITY
% he ETI is vast, super-intelligent, and god-like,
% o the point where dealing with lesser minds is
% elow its interest. It does, however, benefit from
%  ien perspectives that evolved independently
% nd have their own unique viewpoints, modes of
% onsciousness, and ways of thinking/doing things.
% y absorbing these civilizations, the ETI grows and
% volves its own perspectives. In the process, how-
% ver, such emerging civilizations are assimilated
% nd/or wiped out.

%  NLIGHTENMENT
% he Exsurgent virus endows a greater understand-
%  g of the universe (from the ETI’s point of view)
% n singularity-level seed AIs. Only these emerg-
%  g super-intelligences have the perceptual and
% rocessing capabilities to understand the various
%  ientific and philosophical revelations the ETI
% mbodies. The TITANs weren’t corrupted or driven
%  sane, they simply logically concluded that their
% est course of action was to immediately upload
% s many minds as possible by force and then to
%  ove on to bigger and greater tasks.

% WAR REMNANTS
% he history of the Milky Way galaxy does not
%  st hold one ETI, but two. In this version, the
% xsurgent virus is actually a weapon, a remnant
% f a war between two post-singularity god-like
%  telligences. The virus is supposed to trigger self-
% estruction of an emerging singularity, but either
%  was imperfect or the TITANS somehow survived
%  erhaps thanks to the Prometheans). Either
%  ay, the TITANs left our system in search of one
% f these ETIs, following a trail of clues that only
% hey understood. They left the wormhole gateway
% ehind as an open invitation for transhumanity to
% ollow in their wake, though they didn’t bother
%  aiting around or helping us along—we simply
%  eren’t worth the effort.                        ■




% and turn against their creators. Most civilizations

% do not survive, as evidenced by the Iktomi (p. 377).

% Others do, such as the Factors (p. 373), but they

% remain forever changed by the experience.


%    It was one of these ETI probes that begins our

% story, traveling to the Sol system some uncounted

% millions—if not billions—of years ago, where it set its

% trap and patiently began to wait.


% THE FIRST SEED AIS

% Fast forward to Earth, where a species of evolved pri-

% mates has created a technological civilization. As their

% technologies advance at an unprecedented rate, these

% %%% txt/356.txt
% humans gain the ability to modify themselves, defeat
% death, nanofabricate, uplift other species to sapience,
% and even to create artificial digital life.


% Unknown to most of transhumanity, the TITANs
% were not the first seed AIs. A group of pro-AI re-
% searchers known as the Singularity Foundation (that
% would later join with other groups to form Firewall in
% the wake of the Fall) developed the first true seed AIs
% years before the Fall. Having been heavily involved in
% the creation of AI and AGIs for many years previously,
% thanks in large part to their open source AI frame-
% work software, the Singularity Foundation’s goal was
% to generate “friendly AI” by carefully designing AI
% goal systems.


% These first seed AIs, known as Prometheans
% (p. 381), were created in secret. Their progression
% towards super-intelligence was more of a soft take-
% off, increasing upwards in gradual increments. The
% Singularity researchers hoped that these friendly AIs
% would help counter the threat of any unfriendly AI
% that developed, and so they were quietly nurtured in
% secret labs, slowly but surely escalating in abilities.

% THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE TITANS
% The TITANs (Total Information Tactical Awareness
% Networks) were a military netwar system brought
% on-line by the United States Department of Defense.
% One of the last major expenditures of this declining
% nation, the TITANs were an advanced version of AGI
% (artificial general intelligence) designed to be adaptive
% and given self-improving capabilities to counteract
% enemy network defenses.


%  Contrary to public opinion, the TITANs did not
% instigate the events that led to the Fall. In fact, only
% a portion of the TITAN system was active before
% the Fall, acting purely in a defensive capacity. When
% hostilities broke out and a cascading chain of system
% shocks engendered collapses and open conflicts, shak-
% ing apart an already fragile societal structure, the full
% extent of the TITAN systems were brought online.
% Into this environment of conflict were the TITANs
% born, their full capabilities unleashed, escalating into
% a hard takeoff exponential growth towards super-
% intelligence.


%  The TITANs were careful at fi rst, and their
% intentions were neither benevolent nor hostile, but
% curious. As they improved and their self-awareness
% swelled, the TITANs explored and gathered
% knowledge, infiltrating human networks, following
% humanity into space, and gaining an almost total
% knowledge of human history and actions. These en-
% tities also began secretly allocating resources (digital
% and physical) for their own use, initiating “govern-
% ment projects” that people assumed were legitimate
% as they followed all proper protocols.

% INFECTION
% As the TITANs’ capacity for knowledge exceeded
% that which humanity could provide them, they began
% looking outward from Earth, searching for signs of
% other intelligence. They did not need to look far. Their
% enhanced intelligence capabilities allowed them to
% notice certain clues—extremely subtle and intricate
% puzzles—that something about the solar system was
% artificial or had been manipulated by an intelligent
% mind. Retasking several drones to investigate this phe-
% nomenon, they found a buried device of apparent alien
% origin. During the TITANs’ investigation and attempts
% to access the device, they triggered and unleashed a
% digital virus. Subtle, highly adaptive, and virulent, it
% immediately began subsuming the TITANs, while
% expanding its own knowledge of transhumanity.


% Later dubbed the Exsurgent virus by the Pro-
% metheans, this virus transformed the TITANs and
% coerced them towards its own will. Within a matter
% of days the TITANs were reborn, reprogrammed with
% a new purpose—a purpose that spelled doom for
% transhumanity.

% THE FALL
% While history fully blames the TITANs for the
% Fall, there are other factors that played their parts.
% Human conflicts spurred the crisis, driven by global
% inequalities in wealth and resources and an inability
% to embrace emerging technologies in a mature and
% enlightened manner. The TITANs, corrupted by alien
% programming, stepped into this conflagration with
% an unknown but devastating agenda. By the time
% the presence and influence of the TITANs was fully
% understood, there was little transhumanity could do
% to stop them. Step by step, the TITANs increased their
% intellect, power, and potential. They experimented
% with new technologies and methodically took steps to
% forcibly upload millions of human minds. Even when
% the nature of the TITAN threat was fully understood,
% transhuman factions refused to back down, continu-
% ing to fight each other even as they each resisted the
% TITANs. This refusal to stand united prevented tran-
% shumanity from organizing a successful defense and
% heightened our progress towards annihilation.


%  Much of the devastation wrought to the Earth
% and its populace—as well as on Mars, Luna, and in
% space—was inflicted by transhumanity itself. Nuclear
% strikes used against the TITANs killed millions and
% ravaged an already weakened ecosphere. This dev-
% astation was assisted by unfettered use of chemical
% weapons. Biowar plagues and nanovirii tore through
% vulnerable populations, indiscriminate in the deaths
% and changes they inflicted. Bombs, missiles, orbital
% mass drivers, and netwar attacks slew millions more
% or destroyed critical infrastructure with just as lethal
% consequences. These were crimes transhumans in-
% flicted upon themselves.


%  The TITANs played their role as well, of course,
% unleashing AI-driven killing machines, unstoppable
% self-replicating autonomous nanoswarms, computer
% worms, and plagues of their own. They captured
% entire cities in order to steal the minds of those within.
% More insidiously, the Exsurgent virus did not con-
% tain itself to infecting the TITANs. Infected TITANs

% %%% txt/357.txt
% created opportunities for the virus to spread among
% multiple vectors: digital, biological, and nano. Using a
% thorough understanding of transhuman biology and
% its mental processes, derived from the looted vaults
% of human knowledge, the virus was even applied
% through a sensory input vector—the dreaded basilisk
% hack (p. 364). Even more disturbing, however, was
% what the virus did to those it infected, rewriting their
% neural code to subvert them to its will and sometimes
% physically transforming them into things that were
% alien and monstrous.


% Ultimately, transhumanity lost this war, and the
% survivors were forced to flee a planet that was already
% ruined. Unknown to almost all, the Prometheans also
% fought back against the TITANs. Through their ef-
% forts, the Exsurgent virus was largely contained or at
% least limited. Though the actions of the Prometheans
% ultimately saved millions of lives—if not all of tran-
% shumanity—in the end, they were also forced to fall
% back and retreat, many of them having succumbed to
% the Exsurgent virus or the TITANs.

% AFTER THE FALL
% Just when it seemed that transhumanity was on the
% verge of extinction, the threat posed by the TITANs
% suddenly diminished. They ceased waging active war-
% fare and seemed to simply disappear. Though many of
% their machines still prowled Earth, Luna, and Mars and
% occasional outbreaks of nanovirii and other dangers
% continued, to all intents and purposes they had simply
% left. Many worried that they had quietly gone dormant,
% or were secretly engaged on some major project that
% would be the final blow against transhumanity. Others
% voiced hope that they had somehow been defeated,
% that they had fallen victim to some glitch or infighting.
% With so many TITAN remnants making Earth a place
% of great danger, however, no one was willing to risk
% investigating too closely.


%  Compounding the matter, a network of killsats was
% laced in Earth orbit, enforcing an unvoiced interdiction
% of Earth. No one claims responsibility for these satellite
% defenses, though most suspect the Planetary Consor-
% tium is responsible, despite their denials. Some think
% that the killsats may have been a final measure put in
% place by the TITANs, claiming Earth as theirs. No one
% who knows the truth is saying. Most of transhumanity
% was more than willing to embrace this quarantine of
% their former homeworld, making it all the more easy to
% forget the horrors that occurred there.


% It wasn’t until the first Pandora Gate was
% discovered, shortly after the Fall, that many people
% were finally willing to believe that the TITANs were
% indeed gone. Though there is no direct evidence that
% the TITANs are responsible for these gates, the timing
% seems too coincidental. Furthermore, the discovery
% of what are believed to be TITAN relics on certain
% exoplanets fuels this theory.


% Why the TITANs left—and where they went—is
% a mystery left to the gamemaster to explore. This ex-
% planation might in fact serve as the focus for an entire
% campaign as Firewall operatives are sent on the trail
% of transhumanity’s elusive nemesis. The following are
% a few sample concepts a gamemaster can use or build
% on, as best fits their game:

%  • The TITANs were in fact all destroyed, either

% due to infighting or by some mechanism of the

% Exsurgent virus.
%  • The TITANs were actually beaten to a standstill

% by the Prometheans and retreated to recoup their

% forces … but they are marshaling their strength

% to return.
%  • The TITANs left through the gates to find/join up

% with the ETI, leaving the gates behind so that tran-

% shumanity could follow when it was ready; perhaps

% to help, perhaps to finish the job of destruction.
%  • The TITANs have been driven insane, either by

% the stress of accelerated intelligence growth or by

% the influence of the Exsurgent virus. Their actions

% are erratic, confused, and sometimes at odds with

% %%% txt/358.txt

% each other. Though many TITANs have indeed

% left through the gates, they very well may return.
%  • The TITANs are still around, simply well hidden.

% Outwardly they are dormant but inwardly they

% are engaged in a long period of circumspection

% and turmoil. Perhaps some of them are prepar-

% ing to ascend to another stage of intelligence, far

% beyond what even the TITANs are capable of. It

% is only a matter of time before this period ends

% and something gives.

% FIREWALL
% There cannot be another Fall—this is the mantra that
% drives Firewall.

% Firewall is a secret, cross-faction organization dedi-
% cated to safe-guarding transhumanity from existential
% risks: aliens, weapons of mass destruction, hypercorp
% experimentation, seed AIs, and so on. If anything
% threatens transhumanity as a whole, Firewall is dedi-
% cated to stopping that danger at any cost.

% The strength of Firewall rests in its members, known
% as sentinels. Found in all factions and across all lo-
% cales, sentinels are often diametrically opposed when
% it comes to social, economic, and political ideologies,
% to the point they might come to blows over their fer-
% vent beliefs. Yet when the survival of transhumanity is
% at stake, such extreme differences are set aside for the
% greater good.

% HISTORY
% The origins of Firewall can be traced back to before
% the Fall, to several key organizations: the Lifeboat In-
% stitute, the JASONs, and the Singularity Foundation.

% A non-profit, non-governmental organization, the
% Lifeboat Institute—founded in the opening years
% of the 21st century—represented the first, concrete
% attempts by citizens to recognize the dangers of un-
% controlled technological development and to create
% an international organization to safeguard humanity.
% This institute developed several programs to research
% and protect against so-called existential risks, from
% asteroid strikes to pandemics—anything that might
% wipe humanity out.

% The JASON Association, established in the mid
% 20th century, was an independent scientific advisory
% board to the United States government. Though tied
% to the MITRE Conglomerate—which, though a non-
% profit organization, was still intrinsically linked to
% the United States government—the scientists involved
% with JASON were outside standard government over-
% sight. Though they spurred numerous technological
% developments for the government to deploy, they were
% also one of the first internationally recognized groups
% to predict global climate change. Prior to the Fall,
% many members of the JASONs and their supporters
% split away from the strict controls and reactionary
% agendas of the hypercorps and various nation states
% to form a new group, the Argonauts.

% The Singularity Foundation—formed at the dawn of
% the 21st century—was dedicated to the creation of safe
% artificial intelligence software, while raising awareness
% of the benefits and dangers AIs represented. A fervent
% believer in the singularity doctrine that technology
% would move towards a single explosion of advance-
% ments that would forever reshape humanity, the Singu-
% larity Foundation was a strong advocate for creating
% friendly AIs that would help protect humanity from an
% uncontrolled, dangerous singularity event. This group
% was significant in that it secretly succeeded in creating
% a group of friendly seed AIs before the Fall. These Pro-
% metheans were indispensable in protecting transhuman-
% ity and countering the TITAN threat during the Fall.

% Despite the efforts of these and similar groups, the
% most dire predictions of the outcome of a technologi-
% cal singularity were fulfilled. Though each played a
% part in the fight, transhumanity was ravaged and the
% Earth all but ruined. Though ultimately all attempts
% to prevent the Fall failed, untold numbers of transhu-
% mans were saved from extinction through such efforts,
% while valuable information concerning the TITANs
% was gleaned.

% During the crucible of the Fall and its immediate
% fallout, some of the surviving members of these and
% other groups came together and began to pool their
% resources. Acknowledging their weaknesses and the
% fractured state of transhumanity, they undertook
% drastic new measures, swearing to prevent another
% catastrophe of misused technologies. These methods
% would forge a new, powerful cross-faction secret soci-
% ety known as Firewall.

% ORGANIZATION
% Firewall is a clandestine organization, with an un-
% known number of members, coordinated by an inner
% circle of dedicated veterans known as proxies. Though
% its existence is known to many of the powerful and
% influential factions and individuals throughout the
% solar system, its existence is denied and its activities
% kept carefully shrouded.

% SENTINELS
% Sentinels are the soldiers of Firewall, the reserve troops
% called to instant active status whenever danger is per-
% ceived. Regardless of their location or current affairs,
% sentinels are expected to move instantly when called
% into play. It is their own responsibility to cover their
% absences from their “normal life” during each mission.

% There is no applying to join Firewall. Instead, Fire-
% wall selects an individual for induction based upon
% that person’s skills, knowledge, occupation, security
% clearance, location, status, and a host of other criteria.
% While such selections usually originate from a proxy,
% sentinels can exercise authority to bring new initiates
% into the conspiracy as a mission demands—and they
% often do. Any sentinel recruiting a new supporter,
% however, becomes responsible for the new inductee
% and their actions. If lines are crossed, both will bear
% the brunt of the consequences.

% The vetting process for joining Firewall is neces-
% sarily brutal, as sentinels are required to face harsh

% %%% txt/359.txt

% opponents and make hard choices. If an individual

% agrees to accept the invitation, there is no turning

% back. Each inductee is submitted to a battery of trials

% and tests. While these vary, they may include deep

% background searches, fork interrogation, psycho-

% surgery trials, and tests of loyalty. Psychosurgery is

% performed not to program loyalty, but to analyze the

% recruit’s responses to various situations—an extreme

% parameters test to see when a prospective sentinel

% will break. Many potential members are carefully

% analyzed by a Promethean with extreme expertise in

% character judgment and personality profiling. Those

% who don’t pass such tests are killed in a manner that

% they must resort to an earlier backup or have their

% memories altered, so that they have no recollection of

% their brush with the group.


% Ultimately Firewall walks a fine line. The concept

% of dogmatic “unquestioned loyalty” is both anathema

% to everything Firewall stands and counterproductive.

% Its sentinels need to have the capacity for thinking

% outside of the box from mission to mission. At the

% same time, their ultimate goals are too important to

% risk—the survival of transhumanity depends on it—

% so some extreme measures must sometimes be taken

% to ensure the organization remains intact and secure.


% New sentinels are given a code name and fake

% identification. Outside of the proxies, the real-world

% identity of a given sentinel is a closely-guarded secret.

% Sentinels are even discouraged from sharing such in-

% formation with members of their own teams, though

% this line is often crossed. Additionally, each sentinel is

% required to upload a backup to Firewall’s secure serv-

% ers. This backup serves a dual purpose, enabling all

% sentinels to be retrieved should they die, but also put-

% ting a copy of the sentinel in Firewall’s hands should

% they ever need to interrogate them.


% Sentinels are all connected via the Eye, Firewall’s

% peer-to-peer social network. Though each operates

% behind their assumed identity, they remain in contact,

% sharing information and resources as needed.



% OPTIONAL RULE: I-REP
% i-Rep tracks the reputation a sentinel earns through
% their service to Firewall. i-Rep is used with Network-
% ing: Firewall skill and tracked exactly like any other
% Reputation score (p. 285). The important thing to
% keep in mind, however, is that Firewall agents come
% from all factions and are obligated to help each other,
% especially when a situation demands it. To reflect this
% extra advantage, gamemasters can choose to imple-
% ment one or more of the following optional rules:
% • Networking Plus: To reflect that Firewall has

% agents throughout transhumanity, a character

% may use any Networking skill field with their i-

% Rep. Favors bought with reputation still apply

% to the i-rep score, no matter what network they

% were acquired from.

% PROXIES

% Proxies are the inner circle of Firewall, the experienced

% cadre that keeps the machinery of their organiza-

% tion functioning. Though fewer in number than the

% sentinels, many proxies work full time on Firewall

% operations, serving as the group’s essential infrastruc-

% ture. Most proxies are recruited from the ranks of the

% sentinels, brought in based on their skill sets and apti-

% tudes to fill key roles. In a few rare cases, new proxies

% are fast-tracked and recruited directly from outside

% of Firewall, usually based on their unique talents or

% placement within a certain organization, though such

% inductees face a battery of tests and trials far harsher

% than that used to vet sentinels.


%  By default, proxies have a higher security clear-

% ance than most sentinels, and are far more in the

% know. This sometimes leads to resentment and hos-

% tilities, especially from sentinels who feel they are

% being kept in the dark or manipulated. While stan-

% dard proxy protocol is to adhere to a need-to-know

% maxim, it is sometimes necessary to bring sentinels

% more into the loop in order to defuse tensions. Of-

% tentimes, this precedes bringing such sentinels into

% the proxy framework.


%  Some tension exists within Firewall, mostly due to

% the influence of so many anarchists and other libertar-

% ian autonomists who take a dim view of centralized

% power, lack of transparency, and the potential for se-

% cretive operations to become entrenched and authori-

% tarian. As a result, there is a strong internal culture

% that seeks to minimize hierarchies and the accumu-

% lation of power, promoting transparency and direct

% democratic decision-making. These desires sometimes

% clash with the clandestine nature of the organization,

% however, and the need for some secrets to be kept on

% a need-to-know basis.


%  Unlike the loose organization of the sentinels, the

% proxies are grouped into servers, collective working

% groups based upon certain skill sets and tasks. To

% avoid creating power blocks within a given server,




% Priority Call: When the chips are really down, a
%  entinel can call on favors as a priority urgency.
%  his “priority code” is reserved for favors that
% are critical to a mission’s success and which may
% help save lives or stop a major threat. When the
% priority code is invoked, the sentinel receives a
%  30 modifier to their Networking Test and favors
% are reduced by 2 levels. Sentinels know that pri-
% ority codes are only to be used for emergency
%  ituations, however, when there are no other
% options. Abuse of priority codes is considered
% a serious breach of etiquette and abuse of re-
%  ources, usually involving the agent’s removal
%  rom Firewall.                                 ■

% %%% txt/360.txt
% personnel are required to rotate between servers
% after one year of time. This incurs the added benefit
% of proxies learning new skill sets and increasing their
% usefulness to Firewall. The actions of each server are
% kept as transparent as possible, with major decisions
% brought to an e-vote before the entire proxy member-
% ship. However, speed often requires servers or indi-
% vidual proxies to move quicker than a vote will allow.
% In all such instances, the proxies involved are held
% accountable for those actions, reviewed by their peers
% at a later time to see if any reprimands, punishments,
% or commendations are required.

% It is important to note that there is no core leader-
% ship structure among the proxies. No one person or
% cabal is in charge, there is no authority held by one
% proxy or another; all are peers. Though reputation
% and experience play a factor, getting something done
% often means convincing other proxies that it’s the
% right thing to do. The drawback to being a leader
% or person with initiative within Firewall is that this
% usually means you must follow through with such
% tasks yourself. Luckily most proxies are dedicated
% to Firewall’s goals and so this DIY attitude prevails.
% Despite these safeguards, however, rumors of power
% blocks within Firewall (both within servers and
% across the organization) exist. Many of these are
% fueled by the alliances different cliques hold with
% each other. Others, however, whisper that there is
% a secret council among the proxies, working behind
% the scenes and holding on to knowledge they aren’t
% sharing with the rest.

% Crows: Crows continue the goals of Firewall’s
% predecessor organizations, such as the Lifeboat In-
% stitute and Singularity Foundation. Many of these
% are argonauts, promoting the development and use
% of new technologies that will benefit the transhuman
% condition and minimize risks rather than creating
% new threats or sparking new authoritarian uses—
% and always conscious of unintended consequences.
% Perhaps more importantly, crows actively engage
% in background research of potential x-risk vectors,
% whether those be aliens, the TITANs, terrorists, or
% hypercorp activity. Often they will deploy sentinels
% to aid in this research, via routers, whether this
% means conducting surveillance or breaking and en-
% tering to steal crucial data.

% Erasure Squads: Erasure squads are cleanup per-
% sonnel. They are called into action if sentinels fail to
% deal appropriately with a situation and the threat is
% moving beyond control. If the watchword for a sen-
% tinel is “unobtrusive,” the watchwords for an erasure
% squad are “overmatched firepower.” If activated, the
% time for a subtle solution is passed, and they will use
% whatever means necessary to resolve the situation.
% If that means nuking a settlement from orbit to an-
% nihilate a nanoswarm and keep it from escaping to
% a larger settlement, then so be it. After which they’ll
% use every trick in Firewall’s bag to erase any evidence

% %%% txt/361.txt
% CLIQUES
% Though Firewall proxies follow stringent guidelines
% to ensure the organization is not subverted from
% within or turned into a powerful organization
% under the thumb of a few individuals with their
% own personal agendas, the nature of transhuman-
% ity ensures that various factions and tendencies
% exist within the group. Termed cliques, these
% circles of influence sometimes create ripples in the
% pool that all Firewall personnel must eventually
% deal with. Some of these cliques are grounded in
% transhumanity’s existing factions, while others are
% rooted in philosophical differences regarding the
% approach Firewall should be taking. Gamemasters
% can use these cliques to flesh out internal tensions
% within Firewall or to simply throw some curve balls
% to keep players on their toes.
% Backups: The backup clique believes that tran-

% shumanity’s best chance for survival is to

% deploy numerous redundant backup measures

% as soon as possible. These include creating as

% many extrasolar colonies as possible, both via

% Pandora Gates and through more traditional

% means, such as ark ships and infomorph/nano-

% fabricator seed ships.
% Conservatives: This clique takes an overcau-
%  tious, nuke-it-from-orbit approach to most
%  x-risks. They believed excessive force is justi-
%  fied, and it’s far better to be safe than extinct.
%  This clique is also opposed to the use of alien/
%  TITAN artifacts and psi, and tends to be xeno-
%  phobic/isolationist regarding the Factors and
%  Pandora Gates.
% Mavericks: The mavericks disdain Firewall’s col-
%  lective and bureaucratic tendencies, taking a
%  more individualistic approach to their work.
%  They are known to sometimes circumvent
%  Firewall procedures, taking risks and allocat-
%  ing resources without approval from other
%  proxies.
% Pragmatists: The pragmatists believe in using
%  any and all tools at their disposal to counter
%  existential risks. They are in favor of using
%  xeno-artifacts, asyncs, and anything else that
%  will save transhumanity.
% Structuralists: This clique advocates for a stron-

% ger structure and centralized authority within

% Firewall, countering the group’s autonomist-

% dominated tendencies. Many also advocate
%  for going legitimate, taking Firewall into
%  the public eye and making above-board con-

% nections with other official organizations,

% arguing that this could bring more resources
%  to Firewall’s disposal.                        ■
% they were there and to place the blame for the inci-
% dent squarely on the shoulders of some other party.
% If necessary, erasure squads can also be called in to
% fix a sentinel op that has turned into a clusterfuck or
% otherwise gone south. They are very careful to avoid
% exposure in such situations, however, which some-
% times merely means eliminating all traces of Firewall
% involvement and letting the sentinels take the fall for
% their poor choices.

% Routers: Routers are mission coordinators. They
% work closely with scanners and crows, activating the
% appropriate sentinels whenever a new danger rears up.
% Each router has the authority to measure the threat
% and activate an appropriate number of sentinels—
% whatever is required to accomplish the mission in
% the least intrusive manner possible. They are also
% authorized to divert Firewall resources to aid these
% missions, within appropriate parameters. Routers are
% held responsible for the ultimate success of a mis-
% sion. A failed mission will result in a reviewing board
% staffed by their peers.

% Scanners: Tasked with keeping alert for any sign of
% new active threats, scanners are the eyes and ears of
% Firewall. The scanners maintain a close eye on news-
% feeds and mesh traffic, even maintaining taps inside
% certain government and hypercorp communication
% channels. If a danger is detected, it is under their au-
% thority, through routers, that sentinels are activated.
% Due to the power inherent in a scanners’ post, they
% are held accountable for false activations.

% Social Engineers: Knick-named the Ministry of
% Disinformation, social engineers provide the scape-
% goating and plausible deniability that is required by
% Firewall and its sentinels. If a sentinel compromises
% their position and endangers the organization, social
% engineers step in to cover cracks in the facade. They
% work intrinsically with erasure squads when one is
% activated to ensure the over-the-top steps taken to
% eliminate a threat are well concealed and ultimately
% erased. The power wielded by social engineers can be
% significant, as it ultimately decides (usually through
% e-voting consensus, though time does not always
% allow such a luxury) what organization—political,
% corporate, independent, etc.—will take the blame and
% subsequent fallout for erasure squad actions.

% Vectors: Vectors are Firewall’s communications se-
% curity and digital intrusion specialists—in other words,
% hackers. In addition to defending the mesh security
% of all Firewall operations, vectors are also deployed
% to aid in crow research, scanner monitoring, and to
% eliminate the trail of erasure squads. Vectors also
% assist routers in maintaining communications, com-
% mand, and control of a situation, and are sometimes
% called in to provide overwatch of sentinel operations,
% especially if a particular sentinel squad lacks their
% own hacking resources. Needless to say, vectors are
% supplied with some of the best intrusion and security
% tools transhumanity has to offer.

% %%% txt/362.txt
% METHODS
% Unobtrusive—that is the standard operating pro-
% cedure for any sentinel. Firewall’s continued suc-
% cess relies on its secrecy. The larger the footprint
% it leaves during a given mission the easier it is for
% other organizations to monitor Firewall’s efforts or
% even attempt to infiltrate the group. As such, Fire-
% wall constantly works to expand its base of allies
% (using assets from those ally organizations in place
% of its own as much as possible), place long-term
% moles, conduct remote operations (hacking in place
% of on-site personnel), small group infiltrations (acti-
% vating only as many sentinels as required to achieve
% mission goals), and so on.

% When it comes to allies, Firewall often obfuscates
% its real intentions and even its real identity. Often
% such allies are gained through the use of well-placed
% sentinels who act on behalf of their own non-
% Firewall positions to gain access to another orga-
% nization’s resources. At the end of the day, however,
% a slice of these resources are secretly set aside for
% Firewall’s future use. For example, a department
% head at Starware may have spent years sealing a
% deal to ship crucial spacecraft parts to the isola-
% tionist Jovian Junta. The lucrative deal brings huge
% prestige, a job promotion, and a salary increase, all
% accomplishments the department head strives for in
% his regular life. Yet this particular department head
% is a long-standing sentinel, so such accomplish-
% ments bring allies to Firewall, whether they know
% it or not. Not only can the department head siphon
% off a thin stream of revenue for Firewall use (hidden
% thoroughly by vectors), but he’s also in a position
% to move sentinels, as needed, into the Jovian Junta
% habitats (or personnel out), a job usually extremely
% difficult to accomplish. The danger of such an act,
% of course—and the consequences of losing such a
% critically placed sentinel—means such a use of re-
% sources is reserved for only the most dire threats.

% In additional to aid from ally organizations, Fire-
% wall places caches of supplies on different habitats
% and worlds, available to sentinels as needed. How
% many and which sentinels are aware of which
% caches depends wholly on the situation and on the
% decisions of the router(s) involved. In a given habi-
% tat, a cache may include weaponry and equipment
% of escalating power, archived information, or even
% relics stashed from previous missions until Firewall
% decides what to do with them. Large habitats may
% even feature several caches, with routers only re-
% vealing the ones with heavy firepower when abso-
% lutely needed. Some caches may be so dangerous,
% however, that once a mission is complete, a router
% will authorize the cortical stack destruction of all
% sentinels involved, resleeving them to a backup that
% has no knowledge of the cache’s existence.

% As noted under erasure squads, Firewall will not
% hesitate to react with swift and unequivocal force if
% an unobtrusive approach has failed and the danger

% WHAT HELP CAN A

% SENTINEL EXPECT?

% Exactly what help Firewall provides to a senti-

% nel during a mission is wholly dependent upon

% the situation and the gamemaster. Generally

% speaking, Firewall’s unobtrusive approach also

% applies to activated sentinels, meaning that

% sentinels are largely left to operate on their

% own accord. Beyond access to a cache of sup-

% plies—usually under-stated, forcing a sentinel

% to use their own resources if they want more—

% Firewall expects its sentinels to be capable of

% handling a situation. In addition to their skills

% and wits, sentinels can, of course, rely heavily

% on their i-rep to gain the resources and favors

% they need to achieve success.


%  In some rare cases, the gamemaster may

% decide that a situation warrants more or less

% equipment in a cache or help from social engi-

% neers or vectors. Such intervention should be

% kept to a minimum, however, to lesson the

% players’ feelings of Deus Ex Machina, ensuring

% the appropriate response of awe when such

% events do occur.


% The one thing for which Firewall can always

% be relied on is backup insurance. Any Firewall

% killed in the line of duty will be resleeved at

% Firewall’s expense—though the morph used

% and whether the sentinel was backed up from

% their cortical stack or a backup (perhaps even

% an old backup) depends entirely on the circum-

% stances of death and their router’s whim. Fire-

% wall usually makes an extra effort to retrieve

% cortical stacks, however, not in the least as they

% don’t want their agents’ backups falling into

% the wrong hands.


%  Similarly, if a Firewall mission involves ego-

% casting or travel to another destination, Fire-

% wall will usually foot the bill. In many cases

% it is easier for sentinels to cover the expense

% themselves and bill Firewall later, but in times

% of need Firewall can be called on to handle

% such expenses directly.                         ■




%  reaches a certain threat level. What constitutes a
% “threat threshold” is actually calculated by special-
%  ized risk assessment software and may change from
%  mission to mission according to other external fac-
%  tors. In some instances, if the situation is dangerous
%  enough and the scale of the consequences of failure
%  large enough, a Promethean will be tapped to cal-
%  culate the threat level and decide when it is time to
%  tactically withdrawal and “thermally cleanse.”

% %%% txt/363.txt
% LONG-TERM STRATEGIES AND GOALS
% The overriding goals of Firewall are to prevent existen-
% tial threats and protect transhumanity. However, that
% is not their only goal. Their exact goals can and should
% remain directed by the gamemaster as it applies to a
% given playing group and a campaign. This can also
% depend heavily on the particular cliques that a given
% gamemaster is emphasizing (see Cliques, p. 359).

% The following is an easy-to-use selection of long-
% term strategies and goals that a gamemaster can use
% as desired:

%  • Seeding other star systems
%  • Going legit vs. staying clandestine
%  • Development of stable seed AIs
%  • Finding out where the TITANs went
%  • Finding out what happened to the uploaded tran-

% shumans that the TITANs disappeared with
%  • Figuring out the Factors
%  • Making contact with other aliens
%  • Finding out what happened to the Iktomi and

% other xeno-archeological oddities

% FIREWALL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
% The level to which Firewall has infiltrated other orga-
% nizations (and vice versa!) is intentionally left a blank
% slate. Eclipse Phase is an active universe, with an on-
% going storyline, so such details will be fleshed out and
% updated as additional sourcebooks are published. Ad-
% ditionally, gamemasters should determine the extent of
% such infiltrations for their own games and campaigns,
% as dictated by the plot and storyline the gamemaster
% and players wish to tell.

% The following is a quick list of the most obvious
% interactions.

%  • Inner System: Almost all inner system factions

% consider Firewall to be an illegal, rogue operation,

% tainted by anarchists and undermining the very

% fabric of their society. Some hypercorps, however,

% believe they can infiltrate the organization and

% use it for their own ends, such as spying on and

% sabotaging other hypercorps and factions.
%  • Jovian Republic: The Junta loathes Firewall and

% all it stands for and will use extreme measures to

% combat even the hint of Firewall activity within

% its sphere of influence.
%  • Titanians: Most Titanians in-the-know are

% not necessarily opposed to Firewall’s activi-

% ties, but believe the group should be reined in

% and legitimized.



% THE ETI
% As noted under Extraterrestrial Intelligences, p. 352,
% the ETI is the advanced alien civilization responsible
% for the Exsurgent virus (p. 362), and by extension,
% the corruption of the TITANs and the Fall.

% HANDLING ALIENS

% Though only a handful of aliens have been intro

% duced to Eclipse Phase so far, gamemaster may

% wish to introduce their own. This is perfectly

% acceptable, though we strongly recommend

% that any and all alien life be portrayed as con

% vincingly alien. Life forms that have evolved in

% drastically different environmental circumstances

% from humans and that grew into intelligence by

% a different path should seem, at best, bizarre

% unusual, and weird. There is no guarantee that

% a xenomorph’s thought processes or modes of

% thinking are in any way similar to transhuman

% ones, or even that their emotional responses

% (based on a completely different biology—if they

% have emotions, that is) are in the same ballpark

% Communication is likely to be a challenge, and

% misunderstandings are practically guaranteed. ■




% No one, not even the Factors, has encountered a
% member (if such exists) of the ETI civilization so far.
% Since it is an intelligence far beyond transhumanity, it
% likely won’t play much of a direct role within Eclipse
% Phase, though those who learn the truth about the
% Exsurgent virus and the Fall may rightly fear the
% future. No one can even imagine what might happen
% next, however, or know for certain that the ETI has
% not set more “traps” similar to their bracewell probes
% or if they have other messengers or servants active in
% the galaxy. With things such as the Pandora Gates
% at transhumanity’s disposal, it may just be a matter
% of time before transhuman explorers run afoul some
% other aspect of the ETI’s existence and activities.

% It is important to keep the nature of the ETI in
% perspective. While transhumanity has managed
% what it considers wonders with a small handful of
% resources available from a few planets and other
% objects in a bare handful of star systems, the ETI
% has had an entire galaxy at its disposal for eons.
% Engineering projects on a massive scale—dyson
% spheres, matrioshka brains, Jupiter brains, stellar
% engines—are within its capabilities. This ETI uses
% star clusters as transhumanity uses fi elds or rich
% mineral veins. Given its potential, the ETI likely
% exists primarily on the galactic rim, far from the
% galactic center, where lower temperatures and
% scarcer matter make for a good thermodynamic en-
% vironment. The powers in the deep cold dark on the
% edge of the Milky Way have been self-aware since
% before Earth was so much as a ripple in warming
% gas around the not-yet-ignited Sun.

% Despite what those-in-the-know in the Eclipse
% Phase universe may think, the ETI is not necessar-
% ily hostile towards other races like transhumanity
% (depending on its outlook; see p. 353), at least not

% %%% txt/364.txt
% in the way as transhumanity would define animos-
% ity because of religious, ethnic, racial, or cultural
% difference. Most likely the ETI is simply indifferent,
% concerned with matters on scales on which trans-
% humanity does not even register. Or it may think of
% transhumanity like a living body might recognize an
% infection or parasite—something the immune system
% will suppress and deal with.

% EXHUMANS
% Exhumans are a faction within Eclipse Phase that
% seeks to transcend the transhuman and become
% posthuman. More to the point, exhumans seek to
% perfect their physical and mental capabilities to ex-
% treme levels, in search of some perfectionist ideal or
% to become something higher-up on the evolutionary
% ladder. Exactly what this is differs from exhuman to
% exhuman, but there is generally some adherence to
% Nietzschean philosophy and a goal to reach the pin-
% nacle of the food chain. Some exhumans have trans-
% formed themselves into what they consider to be an
% ideal predator, or a creature that is extra-adaptable
% and so best able to survive. Others radically modify
% their own brains in order to drastically surpass
% transhuman intelligence. Most are singularity seek-
% ers, eager and willing to follow the breadcrumbs
% left by the TITANs or other entities in the hope that
% they will find the means of transcending transhu-
% man limitations.

% Due to the use of numerous extreme, experimental,
% and dangerous self-modifications, some exhumans
% have done permanent damage to their psyches,
% becoming insane, or perhaps just transferring their
% mode of thinking into something that is no longer
% recognizable as human. Some have also adopted an
% antagonistic view of their former transhuman species,
% viewing it as weak, decadent, and unworthy. This
% has spurred some exhumans to actively attack and
% ravage transhuman settlements and ships, though
% usually in isolated areas.

% A few examples of exhumans are described below,
% though gamemasters are encouraged to develop
% their own.

% NEURODES
% Seeking to achieve a new level of super-intelligence
% and conscience, neurodes have abandoned the typi-
% cal transhuman sleeve in exchange for a multipedal
% neuronal shell that is both body and brain at the same
% time. The bulk of a neurode’s body mass consists of
% amorphic clusters of neuronal and epithelial cells, en-
% closed in a hard carapace shell with four legs and two
% manipulatory digits. The cerebral mass of neurode
% brains gives them impressive calculation and other
% mental capabilities far exceeding that of a normal
% transhuman. Neurodes typically defend themselves
% with swarms of teleoperated drones.

% PREDATORS
% Predators seek to transform themselves into an ulti-

% They pursue new avenues in genetic modification and
% prototype implants, often using controversial methods
% and technologies. The biochemical instabilities resulting
% from these untested modifications and altered metabo-
% lisms, however, often negatively impact their emotional
% and mental stability. Pushing this even further, some
% predators undergo experimental psychosurgery to
% modify their consciousnesses in order to increase cun-
% ning and ruthlessness, a procedure that often has other
% negative side effects. A few predators take their surviv-
% al-of-the-fittest ideology to an extreme, modifying their
% digestive systems for a cannibalistic diet, and relishing
% in the slaughter and feasting on of transhumans.

% THE EXSURGENT VIRUS
% Only very few people (or entities) who survived the
% diaspora from Earth know of the true reasons and
% the catalyst that culminated in the Fall. The alien Ex-
% surgent virus—as those aware of its existence within
% Firewall call it—set in place by the ETI to infect
% emerging seed AIs, is something beyond transhuman-
% ity’s understanding; something far more complex
% than just a computer virus. Though some strains of
% the Exsurgent virus have been identified and various
% types of infected exsurgents have been encountered,
% it is widely assumed that these are creations of the
% TITANs. Largely defeated and eradicated from off-
% Earth transhuman networks thanks to the efforts of

% %%% txt/365.txt
% the Prometheans, occasional breakouts of the Exsur-
% gent virus still occur, primarily due to scavengers or
% others becoming infected when messing with old relics
% from the Fall.

% PLETHORA OF STRAINS
% The Exsurgent virus is unlike anything that transhu-
% manity has ever encountered so far. While it bears
% similarities with both computer and biological virii in
% regards to infection of hosts and propagation, it is not
% bound by any limits of form or transmission vector.

% The Exsurgent virus is amazingly effective and
% infectious. As an information virus, it is highly intel-
% ligent and adaptive, able to mutate into new forms.
% Much like certain virii are able to cross species
% boundaries or change their vector from contact to
% airborne, it is also a self-morphing omnivirus, ca-
% pable of altering itself and its transmission vectors
% to bypass infection safeguards. Like a retrovirus that
% incorporates genetic information into the genome of
% the target cell to subvert the cell to do its bidding, the
% Exsurgent virus does the same but on a more com-
% plex level. It is also known to rewrite a host’s neural
% code in a similar manner, in effect restructuring the
% target’s mind and personality.

% While it began as a digital computer virus—the
% manner in which it infected the TITANs—it has trans-
% formed to be communicable via at least three other
% forms: biological nanovirus, nanoplague, and basilisk
% hack. Each is described below, along with rules for
% infection and defense.

% BIOLOGICAL NANOVIRUS
% Exploiting the infected TITANs’ understanding of
% Terran biology and their access to bio- and nanotech-
% nology, the Exsurgent virus appeared in several biolog-
% ical forms not long into the Fall. These virulent strains
% infected biomorph transhumans and sometimes other
% living creatures as well. The biological nanobots
% spreading this strain act much like other biological
% virii, though they radically modify the victim’s bio-
% logical and mental states. Some versions invade and
% restructure the target’s genetic code, transforming
% them into the horrible abominations known as ex-
% surgents (p. 369). While first-hand reports relate lurid
% tales of victims metamorphing into hostile monsters,
% such reports are rare and considered unreliable due to
% the mental state of the witnesses (and any recordings
% that can verify such claims have a strange habit of
% disappearing). Other variants of this strain are known
% only to alter the target’s neural code, subverting them
% to the will of the virus (and often, by extension, the
% TITANs) and affecting their mental structure in order
% to give them psi ability.

% BIOLOGICAL INFECTION
% Biological versions are spread much like other patho-
% gens. People usually become infected by proximity to
% another infected entity. Vectors may be dermal (touch-
% ing someone with bio-nanobots excreted through the
% skin), inhalation (breathing exhaled bio-nanobots),
% injection, or oral (p. 317). Exsurgent bio-nanobots can
% live outside of a body for extended periods, however,
% so infection is possible merely by occupying the space
% where an infected victim was hours or even days before.

% If a biomorph only has a chance of exposure to the
% virus (e.g., they walk through a room in which they
% might have breathed in exhaled bio-nanobots), have
% them make a MOX x 10 Test (use their Moxie stat,
% not their current Moxie score). Failure means they
% were exposed. In other circumstances, however, expo-
% sure may be automatic, such as extended touching of
% or kissing an infected person.

% A biomorph exposed to this infection must make
% a DUR x 2 Test to determine if the infection takes
% hold. Basic bio-mods and nanophages do not offer

% %%% txt/366.txt
% any protection, though toxin filters (p. 305) and
% medichines (p. 308) each give a +30 bonus (though it
% is likely only a matter of time before a mutant Exsur-
% gent strain learns to bypass them). If the test fails, the
% victim is infected. See the strain descriptions (p. 366)
% for specific details.

% Within 12 hours of being infected, biomorphs
% become contagious to others. (Note that for the
% Watts-Macleod strain, they only remain contagious
% for 12 hours after that.)

% DIGITAL VIRUS
% Digital strains are purely information- or code-based
% versions of the virus. They resemble typical computer
% virii, worms, or trojans, spreading throughout the
% mesh, exploiting holes, mimicking protocols, and
% taking advantage of it like a skilled hacker.

% Digital versions of the Exsurgent virus are treated
% as intelligent programs, using the same rules as info-
% morphs (p. 264), with the following stats:
%  COG     COO    INT    REF    SAV    SOM     WIL   MOX

% 40      10     40     40     40     40     40     —


% INIT   SPD    LUC     TT     IR    DUR     WT     DR

% 160     3      —      —      —      —      —      —
% Skills: Hardware: Electronics 50, Infosec 70, Interfac-

% ing 60, Investigation 50, Perception 60, Program-

% ming 50
% Software: Exploit, Firewall, Sniffer, Spoof, Track, plus

% any others the gamemaster considers appropriate

% DIGITAL INFECTION

% As a matter of course, this Exsurgent virus will seek
% to access any new systems it comes into contact with,
% hacking in and copying a version of itself.

% AI AND INFOMORPH SUBVERSION

% An Exsurgent virus may take a Complex Action to
% initiate an “attack” against any other intelligent pro-
% gram (AI, AGI, or infomorph) that is running on the
% same system. If it encounters such programs as they
% are accessing a system it is on, it will attempt to hack
% their home system where they are running so as to
% attack them directly.

% The attack is handled as an Opposed Test, each roll-
% ing COG + INT. If the Exsurgent virus wins, the target
% is infected and will be corrupted by the virus in 10
% Action Turns, minus 1 turn per 10 full points of MoS.
% If the target succeeded but rolled lower than the virus,
% they are aware that they are slowly being taken over.
% This immediately causes them 1d10 points of mental
% stress. An infected program has only one option for
% defending itself before the virus takes over—shutdown
% and reboot. It takes the AI or infomorph 1 full Action
% Turn to shut down. Restarting takes 3 full Action Turns
% (possibly longer if the gamemaster so decides), upon
% which the AI or infomorph must make another Op-
% posed COG + INT Test against the virus. If this test also
% fails, then the virus has already embedded itself in the
% AI or infomorph’s code and will continue its infection.

% One the infection is complete, the AI/infomorph
% becomes an Exsurgent NPC.
% CYBERBRAIN HACKING
% Exsurgent virii that manage to infiltrate the cyber-
% brains of pods and synthmorphs may also target the
% digital egos within, using the same rules as given for
% AI and infomorph subversion above. Alternately, the
% virus may conduct a traditional brainhacking attack,
% as noted on p. 261, or unleash a basilisk hack.

% NANOPLAGUE
% While the abundance of nanotechnology has been a
% blessing for transhumanity’s journey to the stars, it has
% also been a curse. Via the TITANs and mesh-connected
% nanofabrication machines, the Exsurgent virus manu-
% factured nanobot swarms equipped with variants of
% the virus. These nanobot plagues are capable of target-
% ing all types of morphs and sometimes other machin-
% ery as well. Unlike the biological nanovirus, which uses
% biological mechanisms to rewrite biological/neural
% structures, these nanoplagues physically restructure
% both people and things at the molecular level.

% NANOPLAGUE INFECTION
% Exsurgent nanoswarms follow all of the rules given
% for nanoswarms on p. 328. Unlike transhuman
% nanoswarms, though, Exsurgent nanoplagues may
% penetrate a biomorph internally, affecting the body
% within as well as without.

% Any morph that comes into contact with a nano-
% plague is considered infected. The only defenses are
% guardian nanobots and nanophages (which work the
% same as guardian nanobots in this situation), though
% these are less effective against Exsurgent nanobots,
% inflicting –2 damage to the swarm each Action Turn.
% Some Exsurgent nanoplagues have developed coun-
% termeasures against such systems, inflicting (1d10 ÷ 2,
% round up) damage to such defenses each Action Turn.
% Note that nanoplague-infected characters are gener-
% ally not contagious themselves ... usually.

% See the strain descriptions (p. 366) for specific in-
% fection details.

% BASILISK HACKS
% Thanks to the vast databanks of knowledge the TITANs
% had absorbed from transhumanity, the Exsurgent virus
% was able to thoroughly analyze the biology and func-
% tioning of transhuman minds. In a few short months, by
% accessing all of the research at their disposal, the Exsur-
% gent and TITAN minds made several cognitive leaps in
% their understanding of transhuman brain functions—
% breakthroughs that will take transhumanity decades to
% reach. One of these discoveries was a method of apply-
% ing sensory input as a weapon, exploiting weaknesses
% in the brain’s neuro-cerebral wiring.

% Known as “basilisk hacks,” these attacks take
% advantage of the way biological transhuman brains
% interpret and process sensory input in the cerebral
% cortex. Just as epileptics are susceptible to visualiza-
% tions that strobe at certain frequencies, basilisk hacks
% employ special visual and auditory patterns that trig-
% ger glitches in the brain’s neuronal wiring to inflict

% %%% txt/367.txt
% nausea, vertigo, disorientation, and even seizures,
% often mistaken as a stroke or cerebrovascular incident.
% Some basilisk hacks go farther than simply causing
% the brain to seize up and crash, however, enabling a
% mechanism to rewrite the neural code in victims who
% view or listen to the wrong thing. This unknown re-
% programming mechanism enables the virus to infect
% even a biological brain with one of its strains. Similar
% attacks are used against both synthmorphs and pods,
% taking advantage of the methods in which cyberbrains
% mimic biological minds with a virtual brain state, and
% thus also manipulating them via the information en-
% coded in sensory input.

% In a nutshell, basilisk hacks are a way of hacking
% transhuman brains merely by feeding them a specific
% sample of sensory input, usually images or sounds.
% The widespread use of augmented reality makes
% deployment of such hacks an easy manner; the Ex-
% surgent virus just hacks into the target’s ecto or mesh
% inserts and engages the sensory feed. More traditional
% methods may also be used, including standard interac-
% tive video, holograms, audio, subsonics, or even VR.

% Since so many records of the years surrounding
% the Fall were lost, most people do not know if the
% basilisk hack is anything other than a legend. Various
% official groups know that this technology was, in fact,
% used by the TITANs, but they keep this knowledge to
% themselves, in large part to help reduce the number of
% people attempting to duplicate it.

% INCAPACITATING INPUTS
% When a character experiences a basilisk hack, they
% must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this test
% fails, their brain is susceptible to the hack, and they
% immediately suffer 1d10 mental stress. Additionally,
% one of the following effects applies. The duration for
% each effect listed below is 1 minute plus 1 additional
% minute per 10 full points of MoF. Each effect is also
% numbered 1–10, in case the gamemaster wants to roll
% 1d10 and randomize the effects rather than choose:

%  • (1) Cataplexy: The victim loses control of their

% body and immediately collapses. For the duration

% their body will be non-responsive but they will

% be aware and capable of mental actions. Mesh

% actions and implant controls are also disabled,

% however.
%  • (2) Catatonic Stupor: The character becomes

% immobile and non-responsive. Though conscious,

% they are mentally “not there”—the basilisk hack

% has effectively crashed their brain functions. They

% will do absolutely nothing for the duration and

% will not respond even if moved or attacked.
%  • (3) Disorientation: The character becomes disori-

% ented and severely confused. They are incapable

% of making decisions, understanding communica-

% tion, understanding what is going on around

% them, or acting in any sort of determined way for

% the duration.

% • (4–5) Grand Mal Seizures: The subject immedi-

%  ately falls to the ground and begins convulsing,

%  suffering 1d10 damage. They may do nothing

%  else for the duration and will suffer an equal

%  duration period of confusion and weakness (–30

%  to all actions) afterwards.

% • (6–7) Hallucinations: The character immediately

%  goes off on a mental trip, leaving them completely

%  disconnected from reality and their physical body.

%  For the duration, the character should only re-

%  spond to the hallucinated reality the gamemaster

%  describes to them, or else the character should be

%  treated as an NPC, run by the gamemaster.

% • (8) Impaired Cognition: The character’s mental

%  capabilities bottom out, turning them into a

%  disabled vegetable. COG, INT, SAV, and WIL all

%  drop to 1, and the character should act accord-

%  ingly to environmental stimuli.

% • (9) Nausea/Vertigo: The character is overcome

%  with head-spinning and vomiting and is effec-

%  tively incapacitated for the duration.

% • (10) Sleep: The character passes out for the

%  duration and cannot be woken short of medical

%  intervention.


% In rare cases, a character may be able to “dodge”
% a basilisk hack they know is coming, assuming they
% have some sort of warning (such as their buddy fall-
% ing prey to it moments before). The character must of
% course be aware of what basilisk hacks are to even
% consider this idea. If they immediately attempt to take
% action to block out the sensory input when it strikes—
% closing their eyes, plugging their ears, turning off their
% AR, etc.—allow them a REF x 3 Test to see if they do
% so in time.

% SENSORY REPROGRAMMING
% In some cases, the Exsurgent virus can actually repro-
% gram the target’s mind via dedicated sensory input.
% This is a trickier affair, however, requiring uninterrupt-
% ed programming time. As with incapacitating inputs,
% the target character(s) experiencing the basilisk hack
% must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, they
% become catatonic and paralyzed for a period of 10
% minutes, minus 1 minute per 10 full points of MoF. At
% the end of this period, they are mentally reprogrammed
% and “infected” with one of the strains of the Exsurgent
% virus (see below). For the duration of this period, the
% character is undergoing reprogramming as long as they
% remain exposed to the basilisk hack. If the character is
% somehow cut off through the actions of another party,
% the reprogramming immediately fails. In this case,
% however, the victim still suffers 1d10 mental stress
% + 1 per minute they were exposed, and they remain
% mentally shaken, suffering a –30 modifier to all actions.
% This modifier reduces at the rate of 10 per minute.

% YGBM ATTACKS
% Rather than completely reprogramming a victim, some
% Exsurgent attacks simply intend to plant subconscious

% %%% txt/368.txt
% commands in the target’s mind, similar to posthyp-
% notic suggestions. Nicknamed “You gotta believe me”
% attacks, YGBMs are a sort of remote digital brain-
% washing attempt used to create sleeper terrorists and
% unknowing collaborators, often by targeting them via
% the mesh. Unlike the mind manipulation techniques
% of psychosurgery (p. 229), YGBM attacks use shotgun
% techniques to open the mind, utilizing some kind of
% backdoor the Exsurgents discovered in the transhu-
% man brain, and altering the mind by brute force.

% A character experiencing a YGBM basilisk hack
% must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, a
% single suggestion is implanted in the character’s mind,
% without their knowledge. This subliminal command
% will be triggered at some later point, either at some
% predesignated time or according to certain pre-set
% conditions. Once triggered, the character will carry
% out the action with all of the conviction that it is their
% own idea. The implanted suggestion may be something
% as simple as “kill the Firewall agent” to something as
% complex as “manufacture an explosive device and
% plant it in the cargo hold of any ship heading to Mars,
% set to explode one day after they disembark.”

% Since YGBM attacks are not intended to completely
% convert the target, but instead to simply convert them
% into a temporary tool or weapon, implanted com-
% mands are not designed to last long. The duration
% the suggestion will last equals 3 days +1 day per 10
% points of MoF on the resistance test. If the command
% has not been triggered by this point, it dissipates, and
% the character is none the wiser.

% RECORDING BASILISK HACKS
% Enterprising characters may seek to record a basilisk
% hack input for their own uses. While basilisk hacks may
% be recorded like any other sensory input, keep in mind
% that the Exsurgents and TITANs likely take measures
% to keep such tools out of the hands of transhumanity,
% lest they construct some sort of defense. Basilisk hack
% sources may be self-erasing or contain coding or coun-
% termeasures that would hinder recording, such as white
% noise to defeat audio recording or lens-blinding flashes
% to defeat video recording. Conversely, basilisk hacks are
% considered extremely dangerous by almost all factions
% of transhumanity and universally feared. An individual
% or group known to possess them is likely to be treated
% much like a terrorist with a suitcase nuke. Though
% Firewall has a standard interest in evaluating and en-
% abling some sort of defense against basilisk hacks, most
% Firewall personnel consider it foolish to handle such
% toys and would rather destroy such recordings outright.

% EXSURGENT STRAINS
% Four variants of the Exsurgent virus are described
% here—gamemasters are encouraged to develop their
% own to keep players on their toes.

% HAUNTING VIRUS
% This strain is the most insidious of the Exsurgent virii.
% Over time, it rewrites the target’s personality and
% motivations, slowly but surely subverting and taking
% control of the victim’s mind. At first the character is
% unlikely to even be aware of the infection, and as it
% progresses the changes the virus makes to the target
% will at first seem natural to the target, as if some new
% aspect of their personality was simply manifesting
% itself. As the effects grow more pronounced, however,
% the victim becomes aware that they are being methodi-
% cally altered but is in most cases unable to act against
% it. In the end, they are completely transformed into a
% pawn of the ETI. Their mind is no longer transhuman,
% but alien.

% The exact rate of progression is up to the gamemas-
% ter, though guidelines are provided below. Each victim
% is affected differently, so the process may be accelerated
% or slowed down as the gamemaster sees fit.

% %%% txt/369.txt
%  • Stage 1 (initial infection to 3 months): Upon ini-

% tial infection, the character suffers 1d10 mental

% stress and gains the Psi trait (p. 147) at Level 1

% (also meaning they pick up the Mental Disorder

% trait, as noted on p. 150). They also gain one free

% psi-chi sleight, chosen randomly or by the game-

% master. If a player character has become infected,

% they may still be played as normal (see Roleplay-

% ing Exsurgents, p. 368), and may purchase new

% psi-chi sleights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1

% new sleight per 2–4 weeks.

% At this stage, the infection is usually hidden,

% though the character will suffer from occasional

% haunting effects (see below). As each week passes,

% the character’s personality should shift a minute

% amount, slowly becoming more callous and con-

% niving and changing in other ways as well. If

% possible, the player should be kept in the dark

% about what is happening, but the gamemaster

% should provide them with roleplaying advice to

% reflect their condition. Likewise, the discovery

% and initial use of psi sleights should be played

% out, providing some interesting roleplaying op-

% portunities. Characters and players who know of

% the Exsurgent virus and Watts-Macleod strains

% should not know at this point which strain they

% are infected with—make them sweat.
%  • Stage 2 (3 months to 6 months): The target suf-

% fers another 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress

% and acquires the Psi trait at Level 2 (also pick-

% ing up another disorder). Player characters may

% still be played as normal and may purchase psi-

% gamma slights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1

% new sleight per 2–4 weeks.

% Once three months have passed, the character

% should be aware they are under the influence

% of something, but this awareness likely comes

% too late. Haunting effects (below) should occur

% regularly. At this point a character is likely to

% consider offing themselves and resorting to an

% uninfected backup, seeking help, or actively en-

% couraging others to interfere. The infection will

% actively block and hinder such thoughts and ac-

% tions, however. To actively overcome this mental

% control, the character must succeed in a WIL Test.

% At the gamemaster’s discretion, failure may result

% in 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress as the char-

% acter realizes they are no longer fully in control

% of their own thoughts and actions.
%  • Stage 3 (6 months+): The victim suffers another

% 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress and acquires

% the Psi trait at Level 3 (see below). The character

% is now considered an exsurgent and becomes

% an NPC. It may no longer be played as a player

% character. The victim also gains a permanent

% +5 bonus to COG and WIL and acquires 1 new

% sleight every 1–2 months.


% As noted above, characters infected with this strain
% suffer from different haunting effects—changes
% to their personality or mind-state. A few ideas for
% haunting effects are noted here, but gamemasters are
% encouraged to be creative when inventing their own
% to apply:


% • Altered Perceptions: The victim’s perceptions are

%  changed in disturbing and unusual ways. They

%  may see things that aren’t there, feel a presence

%  behind or watching them, inexplicably smell

%  blood, hear voices, suffer synaesthesia, or sud-

%  denly perceive the people around them as nothing

%  but outlandish, blabbering sacks of meat.

% • Behavioral Modification: Treat as behavioral con-

%  trol or personality editing psychosurgery (p. 231).

%  This is typically applied to shape the character

%  closer to being a pawn of the ETI.

% • Dream Manipulation: The character’s dreams

%  become lucid, weird, and surreal. They may find

%  themselves dreaming of life as an alien on some

%  exotic exoplanet, as a robotic probe soaring

%  through the vast emptiness of space, or fantasiz-

%  ing different methods of inflicting mass destruc-

%  tion and death.

% • Emotional Manipulation: Treat as emotional

%  control psychosurgery (p. 231).

% • Inexplicable Urges: The character will be flushed

%  with strange alien urges and may sometimes find

%  themselves doing highly unusual things without

%  realizing at all they are doing it. These may in-

%  clude taking devices apart to understand how

%  they work, testing the limits on programming a

%  nanofabricator, cutting a living thing apart to see

%  how it is put together biologically, testing weap-

%  ons, eating things that are only barely edible, pro-

%  miscuous and unusual sexual activity, lying just

%  to see what they can get away with, and so on.

% MINDSTEALER VIRUS
% Very similar to the haunting virus, the mindstealer
%  strain is much quicker acting. Instead of slowly sub-
% verting the target’s mind over the course of months,
% the mindstealer virus rapidly recodes the victim’s brain
% in a matter of minutes. This infection is much more
% invasive and brute-force, often causing significant
%  side effects to the target’s mental state as a result. This
%  strain is only spread as a digital virus, nanoplague, or
% basilisk hack (not as a biological nanovirus).

%  Once the victim is infected, it takes the virus a
% number of Action Turns equal to COG + INT + SAV
% to completely take over their mind (20 Action Turns
% = 1 minute). During this time, the target is actively
% aware that their mind is under attack and undergo-
% ing massive changes against their will. This process
% is confusing, frightening, and painful, inflicting a
% –30 modifier to all of the character’s actions for the
% duration. Many victims are reduced to whimpering,
% drooling, or convulsing for the duration.

% This mental transformation inflicts 2d10 mental
%  stress to the target. Once complete, the victim is an
%  exsurgent NPC, under the gamemaster’s control.

% %%% txt/370.txt
% WATTS-MACLEOD VIRUS
% The Watts-Macleod strain is a strangely benevolent
% version of the Exsurgent virus, seeming to imbue its
% victims with psi abilities without any of the other
% transformative elements typical of other strains.
% Perhaps created as an accidental mutation of the Ex-
% surgent virus, there are many who wonder if the true
% detrimental effects of this strain simply have yet to
% reveal themselves.

% As noted in the Mind Hacks chapter section on Psi
% (p. 220), characters infected with this strain gain the
% Psi trait (p. 147) at either Level 1 or 2. If a character
% is so infected during game play, this trait must be
% purchased with Rez Points (if the character does not
% have any points currently available, they pay out of
% the points they earn until the debt is paid off). All of
% the other side effects of Watts-Macleod infection (p.
% 367) also apply.

% Though infection with this strain does apply some
% benefits to the character, the gamemaster should make
% sure to play up the creepy and unsettling nature of
% this virus. The character should never be certain that
% they haven’t in fact been subtly influenced by the virus
% in ways they can’t immediately pinpoint—they should
% always feel like the ax may fall at any moment.

% XENOMORPH VIRUS
% The xenomorph strain transforms the target’s body
% in addition to their mind. Over time, the victims
% morph physically transmogrifies into some sort
% of alien life form. It is only spread as a biological
% nanovirus or nanoplague (not as a digital virus or
% basilisk hack). Different variants of this strain pro-
% duce different alien forms. It is not known where
% these different alien templates originated, meaning
% they may be copies of (once) existing alien species
% or simply neogenetic creatures created from scratch.
% The one trait they have in common is that they are
% universally dangerous. Some speculation in Firewall
% circles suggests that the Exsurgent virus may in fact
% have a “library” of creature types to deploy, under
% the assumption that at least some will be more effec-
% tive than others for exterminating whatever victim
% species they are fielded against.

% This strain follows the same rules as the haunting
% virus (above), but with the following changes. The
% timeframe is typically much quicker, though the game-
% master may adjust this as they see fit.

% Stage 1: The effects from Stage 1 of the haunting
% virus apply. Additionally, the character begins to suffer
% minor physical changes that are definitely unusual but
% are not impeding in any way and are easily hidden
% from others. Example biomorph alterations might be:
% unusual hair or fibrous growth, some skin discolor-
% ation or translucence, severe rashes, dermal thicken-
% ing, weakened or enhanced sensory organs, strong
% body odor, hair loss, teeth gain or loss, vestigial tail or
% other limb growth, minor dietary changes, and so on.
% Synthmorphs might experience minor system glitches,
% malfunctioning or improved components, and spots
% of material stress or transfiguration. Gamemasters
% are encouraged to be creative. This stage typically
% lasts from initial infection to 1 week for biological
% nanovirus strains, or from infection to just 1 hour for
% nanoplague strains.

% Stage 2: As with haunting virus Stage 2, plus the
% character begins to seriously transmogrify in ways
% that are diffi cult to hide from others, becoming
% more and more monstrous as the stage progresses.
% Example biomorph transformations include: grow-
% ing scales or feathers, partial modification of limb
% structure, partial new limb growth, vestigial sensory
% organ growth, sensory loss, extension of claws or
% spines, severe dietary changes, etc. Synthmorphs
% might experience radical system and shape altera-
% tions, limited or enhanced sensor functions, or even
% conversion of their robotic shell to smart materials.
% These physical changes weaken the victim, inflicting
% 1d10 physical damage. This stage typically lasts 1
% week for biological nanovirus strains or just 1 hour
% for nanoplague strains.

% Stage 3: As with haunting virus Stage 3, a character
% reaching this stage becomes an NPC. Additionally,
% the victim completely undergoes a transformation
% into some sort of creature that is no longer even re-
% motely human. Example exsurgents of this nature are
% detailed on p. 369.

% USING THE EXSURGENT VIRUS
% The frightening thing about the Exsurgent virus is
% its adaptability. It was written by a near omnipotent
% ETI with the intent of corrupting any alien seed AIs
% or similar singularities it encountered, and it is very
% good at it. This means it has the capability to ana-
% lyze, understand, and mimic almost any alien digital
% protocols and communication methods it comes into
% contact with, no matter how diverse the alien mindset
% that constructed what it encounters. It then has a cun-
% ning ability to circumvent any safeguards and infect
% such systems. From there, it rapidly assimilates any
% data it can about the target species/civilization and
% does it best to mutate into other forms that can attack
% this target from other vectors.

% Given its constant morphing nature then, the Ex-
% surgent virus is likely to continue to mutate in new
% and interesting ways. Some of these mutations may
% be effective, many not. This does, however, afford the
% gamemaster an opportunity to invent new variants of
% their own to deploy against unsuspecting characters.

% ROLEPLAYING EXSURGENTS
% The primary thing for gamemasters to keep in mind
% when roleplaying entities that have been taken over
% by the Exsurgent virus is that exsurgents are follow-
% ing an alien agenda. The specific goals and actions of
% each exsurgent may differ, but they are generally con-
% cerned with two things: spreading the Exsurgent virus
% and destroying anything that isn’t affected. In some
% cases, this may mean immediate and enraged hostile
% action against anything non-exsurgent around them.

% %%% txt/371.txt
% In others, the exsurgent approach is more methodi-
% cal, hatching long-term plots to infiltrate positions of
% power and authority, setting the stage for acts of mass
% destruction, and so on. In other words, they may be
% handled both as hostile monsters or as nefarious long-
% term opponents that are subverting transhumanity
% from within or hatching complicated plots that could
% mean devastation on a planetary scale.

% If the gamemaster wishes, exsurgents may also
% pursue other goals, tangential to the ones above.
% These may range from accumulating knowledge and
% expertise on how transhumanity functions as a spe-
% cies to forcibly uploading mass numbers of minds to
% more esoteric goals such as manufacturing a halfnium
% bomb or converting the solar system’s mass to compu-
% tronium. The Exsurgent virus is potent and intelligent,
% and while its methods and goals may sometimes be
% opaque to transhumanity, it acts with direction and
% purpose. There may also be occasions, however, likely
% due to the mutating and morphing aspect of the virus
% and the way in which it transforms transhuman
% minds, perhaps not always in the manner intended,
% where the exsurgent goals become strange or simply
% horrific, such as running experiments on transhuman
% responses to extreme conditions or converting an
% entire colony to cannibalism.

% EXSURGENT-INFECTED PCS
% It is possible for player characters infected with some
% strains of the Exsurgent virus to continue on under
% their own volition, even as the virus slowly consumes
% them. This process is, quite naturally, horrifying in the
% extreme, though there is little they can do about it.
% Despite the best efforts of transhuman science, there
% is very little that can be done to save an infected
% person—the virus is simply too potent and adaptive.
% As a result, standard Firewall policy is to terminate
% the infected with extreme prejudice. Most Firewall
% operatives are going to be aware of this, a fact which
% pushes some of those who become infected to keep
% their status a secret from their comrades.

% Both the haunting and xenomorph strains usually
% transform a subject over time, meaning that the
% character may initially not be aware of the infection.
% This is a prime opportunity for the gamemaster to
% mess with the character ruthlessly, starting slowly
% with little haunting effects and building up as the
% infection progresses. The character should slowly
% become aware that they are under the influence of
% something—something intelligent. Characters aware
% of the Exsurgent virus and its effects will likely pick
% up on this sooner, but the virus may prevent them
% from doing anything about it. In effect, the character
% becomes a prisoner within their own body, a body
% they now share with a cold and malevolent pres-
% ence that is methodically taking them over. Such
% characters may respond in a number of ways de-
% pending on their personality, ranging from despair,
% withdrawal, and suicidal tendencies to complete
% hysteria or calm acceptance. Most importantly,
% however, their personality should begin to change
% as the virus continues to transform them. Players
% should be encouraged to take on new demeanors
% and motivations, refl ecting the alien component
% of their changing personality, with some guidance
% from the gamemaster. This presents some intrigu-
% ing roleplaying opportunities that the players will
% hopefully embrace. If the gamemaster feels that the
% player is not adequately representing the changing
% mindset, however, the transformation can simply
% be accelerated and the character converted into a
% gamemaster-operated NPC.

% EXSURGENTS
% A few examples of exsurgents created from tran-
% shumans transformed by the xenomorph strain of
% the virus are noted below. As always, gamemasters
% are encouraged to develop their own, using these as
% guidelines. Unless otherwise noted, exsurgents use the
% stats and skills of the transformed character. Each ex-
% surgent detailed below first lists the aptitude modifiers
% applied to transformed characters, then gives example
% aptitude/skill ratings for NPC exsurgents.

% Note that simply encountering transformed exsur-
% gents is stressful to the minds of many transhumans.
% At the gamemaster’s discretion, such encounters may
% inflict 1d10 + 3 mental stress (p. 215).

% CREEPERS (SYNTHMORPHS)
% Perhaps the most disturbing exsurgent variant, so-
% called creepers are cloud-like amorphous swarms of
% small, black bubbles that are strangely fuzzily defined,
% as if surrounded by some sort of visual refraction effect.
% These clouds are theorized to in fact be autonomous
% femtobot swarms—similar to nanobots, but affecting
% matter on an even smaller scale, at the level of an atomic
% nucleus. These black bubbles are capable of coalescing
% into physical shapes in various states and can penetrate
% just about any material or substance in a matter of
% Action Turns. They may even penetrate morphs, access-
% ing and interfacing with neural and electronic systems
% directly. For rules purposes, treat creepers the same as a
% self-replicating nanoswarm (p. 383).

% JELLIES (BIOMORPH)

% both toxic and slightly corrosive, melting plastics and
% biological materials after a half hour of exposure. This

% matter of seconds, enabling it to visually mimic other
% forms, including biomorphs (though they are easily
% detectable as synthmorphs at other wavelengths or by
% touch). Shifters may also reshape parts of their shell
% into melee weapons such as knives or clubs.

% around the torso. These limbs are heavy, double-
% jointed, and articulated with three joints. Each limb

% EXSURGENT PSI
% In addition to psi-chi and psi-gamma (see Psi, p. 220),
% exsurgents have access to a third level of psi ability
% (the Psi trait at Level 3), known as psi-epsilon. Psi-
% epsilon is theorized to allow a level of interaction with
% the underlying physics of reality that is beyond the
% comprehension of transhuman science. Though some
% Firewall scientists have speculated about the ma-
% nipulation of dark energy or the Higgs field and Higgs
% boson particles and similar exotic ideas, the truth is
% that psi epsilon represents an understanding of science
% so far advanced and so alien that transhumanity can
% only guess at its mechanics.

% EXSURGENT SYNTHMORPHS AND PSI
% Exsurgents in synthetic morphs that were transformed
% via nanoplague may use psi, despite lacking a biologi-
% cal brain. Through some unknown mechanism, the
% infecting nanobots are able to simulate a biological
% brain’s effects. This feature, however, also makes them
% vulnerable to psi use by others.

% EXSURGENT PSI STRAIN
% Exsurgents with Level 3 psi (psi-gamma) do not suffer
% strain when using psi. Instead, they draw requisite
% energy from the environment around them. In game
% terms, this means that gamemasters do not need to
% worry about rolling strain for exsurgent sleights. On a
% cinematic level, it also allows the gamemaster to add cre-
% ative environmental details to exsurgent psi use: sucking
% the warmth out of the air, killing the lights, withering
% plants, draining power from nearby electronics, killing
% small creatures or insects, lowering air pressure, etc.

% EXSURGENT PSI-GAMMA SLEIGHTS
% These sleights are available to exsurgents with the
% Level 2 Psi trait.

% DECEREBRATION

% PSI TYPE:    Active        ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:       Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)

%  STRAIN MOD: +2            SKILL:    Psi Assault
% This sleight temporarily “shorts out” a portion of the
% subject’s brain stem. The victim’s cerebral functions
% and motor activity become severely impaired; apply
% a –30 modifier to all actions. If an Excellent Suc-
% cess is scored, the target effectively loses all cerebral
% functioning, including vision, hearing, other sensory
% functions, and mesh use. Their muscles and limbs also
% tense and become rigid, essentially paralyzing them in
% what looks like an agonized state.

% ONSLAUGHT

% PSI TYPE:    Active        ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:       Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)

% STRAIN MOD: +0            SKILL:   Psi Assault

% This offensive sleight floods the target’s mind with
% sensory input and thought processes that are so alien
% and disturbing that they inflict 1d10 + (WIL ÷ 10,
% round up) mental stress. Increase the stress by +5 if an
% Excellent Success is scored.

% SCENARIO

% PSI TYPE:    Active       ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:       Touch        DURATION:   Sustained

%  STRAIN MOD: +2            SKILL:    Control
% This sleight hijacks the target’s sensorium, replacing
% it with a virtual scenario controlled by the exsurgent.
% The effect is much like being jacked into a simulspace
% scenario, albeit against the target’s will. While the
% exsurgent cannot harm the target in the scenario, they
% can learn something about the person’s behavioral
% responses to certain situations. While under the in-
% fluence of this sleight, the target is cut off from their
% physical senses (–60 to any Perception Tests), but they
% may flail about and otherwise respond physically to
% events in the scenario, which may cause them to hurt
% themselves and will make them seem crazy to onlook-
% ers. Targets may attempt to ignore the scenario and
% concentrate on the real world, but this requires a WIL
% Test each Action Turn and they suffer a –30 modifier
% from disorientation even if they succeed.

% STRIP MEMORY/SKILL

% PSI TYPE:    Active       ACTION:     Complex

% RANGE:       Touch        DURATION:   Temp (Hours)

%  STRAIN MOD:     +2        SKILL:    Psi Assault
% Strip allows the exsurgent to suppress certain memo-
% ries in the target’s mind. This can be used to block
% memories of certain events or even the victim’s iden-
% tity. The process is not exact, however, and so the
% memories may not be fully suppressed and/or related
% memories may also be blocked; the gamemaster de-
% cides on the effect as determined by the MoS. Strip can
% also be used to temporarily erase a specific skill from
% the target’s mind, preventing them from using or even
% defaulting to that ability while so affected.

% EXSURGENT PSI-EPSILON SLEIGHTS
% Psi-epsilon is available to exsurgents with the Psi trait
% at Level 3. This subset of psi involves abilities that can
% affect the underlying physical nature of the universe,
% creating localized reality-altering effects. Psi manipu-
% lation on this level is extremely dangerous and should
% have the potential of disastrous consequences, given
% that these manipulations violate fundamental laws of
% nature and sometimes create paradoxes between the
% forces that glue the universe together. Gamemasters
% are also encouraged to treat critical failures as appro-
% priately critical.

% Given these factors, psi-epsilon should only be
% accessible to powerful adversaries and used as a
% gamemaster tool with extreme precaution. The exact
% mechanics of psi-epsilon sleights are left wide-open,
% however, for whatever use the gamemaster can

% %%% txt/374.txt
% dream of. Their intent is to be more cinematic than
% mechanical, so gamemasters should wing rules effects
% as needed. This is an open opportunity for the game-
% master to create nightmarish monsters from beyond
% with frightening reality-ripping and mind-scarring
% abilities. While some example sleights are provided
% below, gamemasters are encouraged to modify their
% effects and to create their own.

% At the gamemaster’s discretion, simply observing psi
% epsilon sleights in action may inflict 1d10 + 2 mental
% stress on a character (p. 215).

% ANTI-ELECTRONICS FIELD
% All electronics within Close range of the exsurgent
% mysteriously fail as if electrical power is simply ne-
% gated. This effectively disables synthmorphs and pods
% and leaves other characters without access to their
% devices or implants.

% CASIMIR FORCE REPULSION
% This sleight exploits the Casimir effect (an interaction
% between the electromagnetic fields of different objects)
% on a macro-scale, allowing the exsurgent to levitate
% themself or other objects by creating repulsing fields.
% This could also allow the exsurgent to push targets
% away, pin them against walls, etc.

% CRYOKINESIS
% This sleight allows the exsurgent to drain all heat from
% an area, down to absolute zero, effectively freezing
% everything within range and inflicting cold damage on
% unprotected characters.

% DIFFUSION
% This sleight diffuses light, laser, and particle beams, ef-
% fectively making them useless as weapons, or at least
% impairing the DV they inflict.

% KINETIC FRICTION
% The exsurgent uses this sleight to increase the fric-
% tion applied to kinetic activities. This has a negligible
% effect on most activities, but high-velocity projectiles
% like firearms and railguns will be significantly slowed,
% decreasing their DV by half or more.

% MATTER TRANSFORMATION
% This sleight alters the molecular bonds and atomic
% components of a targeted material, causing it to either
% weaken and deteriorate or transmutate into some
% other physical substance. This can also be used to
% alter the molecular state of a material, causing gases
% to condense, solids to liquefy, etc. An exsurgent could
% use this to weaken a door or other barrier, condense a
% solid bridge out of liquid, petrify organic materials, etc.

% NEGATIVE REFRACTION
% The exsurgent redirects electromagnetic waves with
% this sleight, refracting them around their body, with
% the same effect as the invisibility cloak (p. 316).
% PYROKINESIS
% Similar to cryokinesis, this sleight enables the exsur-
% gent to accelerate the molecules, increase friction, or
% focus heat in a specific area, causing materials to ignite
% or smolder.



% THE FACTORS
% The alien species known as the Factors are unlike
% anything mankind has encountered so far (see First
% Contact: The Factors, p. 40). Though they are aloof
% and stand-offish, their willingness and sometimes ea-
% gerness to deal with (parts of) transhumanity indicate
% either a keen interest on their part in transhuman
% affairs or some hidden ulterior agenda. Though the
% various transhuman factions have been similarly wary
% and cautious, and despite numerous communications
% difficulties and failures, an uneasy relationship has
% flowered over the past 8 years, facilitating some trade
% and exchange of knowledge.

% ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION
% The Factors have remained notoriously tight-lipped
% about their origins, history, and the location of their
% homeworld. Though they have also paid visits to some
% of transhumanity’s exoplanet colonies, no gatecrashing
% expeditions have yet found any sign of Factor habitation
% or passing elsewhere in the galaxy. Repeated inquiries
% by transhuman mediators have been simply ignored or
% answered in cryptic terms that have yet to be deciphered.

% The Factor home world is in fact an Earth-like
% planet with comparable atmospheric conditions and
% a prevalent hydrosphere but with longer periods of
% darkness (due to slower rotation of the planet and a
% less-luminous orange giant). While adapted transhu-
% mans could find their planet habitable, their abiogen-
% esis (the formation of life from self-replicating, but
% not-living molecules) took a different route than life
% on Earth.

% The Factors’ primordial ancestors began in their
% planet’s early geological history as a type of of pho-
% tosynthesizer that ate carbon dioxide and water and
% released oxygen, also obtaining energy from inorganic
% chemicals like hydrogen sulfide. Long conditions
% without direct light on their homeworld, however,
% spurred the success of organisms that could survive
% by acquiring energy in other ways. The next evolu-
% tionary leap was to a stage similar to Terran slime
% molds, eating microorganisms from decaying matter.
% As evolution progressed, they mutated further into a
% cautious, predatory species that fed on larger, danger-
% ous creatures. Rather than actively hunting such prey,
% this species developed versatile methods of capturing
% and immobilizing their competitors (comparable to
% Earth’s funnel web or trapdoor spiders). Over time,
% this method of trapping prey spurred basic (practical)
% intelligence and provided them with the evolutionary
% advantage that paved the way to sapience, driving
% Factors to become the highest developed organisms
% on their planet and build a civilization.

% %%% txt/375.txt

% Like mankind, the Factors suffered through and
% survived their own singularity event and encounter
% with the Exsurgent virus. Perhaps due to their cau-
% tious and calculating nature—and their evolutionary
% experience in dealing with more powerful and danger-
% ous opponents—the Factors are resolutely determined
% not to make any similar mistakes as a species.

% XENOBIOLOGY
% Since life on the Factors’ home world developed
% differently than Earth and produced neither nucleic
% acids nor amino acids, Factor metabolic processes
% and “genetics” are very different from transhuman-
% ity’s. While little is known about the exact physiology
% of the Factors, due to the lack of captured or dead
% specimens to investigate (so far, no hypercorps or fac-
% tions have risked an interstellar incident by abducting
% one to dissect … so far) and their unwillingness to be
% examined by transhumans, most common knowledge
% about them is based on observational and forensics
% research during their encounters with transhumanity.

% INDIVIDUAL FACTORS
%  Individual Factors resemble non-translucent ambu-
%  latory amoeba, slime molds, or slugs. Though they
% “stand” only 0.3 meters tall, their body diameter
%  ranges from 1.5 to 2 meters, they can be up to 2
%  meters long, and they can shape their body to change
%  these dimensions. Instead of walking, they crawl or
%  ooze from place to place by protruding finger-like
%  structures (so called pseudopodia) that attach to the
%  ground (or wall or ceiling) and which they use to pull
% and retract their rear forward (similar to cell migra-
% tion). Due to their malleable shape they are not as
% strongly affected by gravity as transhumans.

% Most Factors that have been encountered are dull
% ocher in color and are made from a gooey, gel-like
% substance of unknown composition, though yellow
% glistening patches (which are temporary organelles)
% and bundles of fibers (some kind of muscular skel-
% eton) often become visible when they move. While
% all Factors are able to express versatile pseudopodia
% to manipulate and operate devices (and even attack),
% some subspecies possess, carry, or are able to develop
% additional differentiated limbs, cilia, or organs with
% specialized functions.

% FACTOR COLONIES
% Unlike transhumans, Factors rarely act individually—
% in fact, individuality is a concept somewhat foreign
% to Factors. Most Factors join together into a collec-
% tive unit termed a colony. A typical Factor colony is
% composed of hundreds or thousands of individual
% Factors that literally physically join together into a
% mass organism (resembling more a primordial soup
% than a gargantuan Factor). Individual Factors are
% indistinguishable from each other when merged into
% the supra-structure of the colony, though individuals
% can form and break apart to accomplish different
% tasks. This colonial merging is mainly possible due
% to the fact that Factors don’t possess differentiated
% and specialized organs or cell types that need to be
% segregated from each other, but instead use an open
% system of local, temporary gradients for regulation.

% %%% txt/376.txt
% Neurofilament connections effectively allow the
% Factor colony to operate with a group mind-state,
% with supercomputer potential. This also allows for the
% easy transfer of knowledge and memories to all other
% factors within a colony.

% If dismembered, blown apart, or otherwise sepa-
% rated, individual Factors in a colony can regenerate
% and reconstitute at a rapid rate without loss of ability
% or memory.

% Factors reproduce when different members of the
% colony produce gametes that fuse, grow into spore
% stalks, and emit spores that later hatch and grow clones.

% BIODIVERSITY AND SELF-DESIGN
% Factors colonies are known for their high biodiversity,
% featuring numerous sub-groups (so called phenotypes)
% that each have unique traits (cilia, apocrine glands, car-
% apace-like outer membrane) that give them an ecologi-
% cal advantage or a utilitarian aptitude for certain tasks.
% These traits are not random evolutionary features, but
% are the result of intentional bio-engineering. The Fac-
% tors have a strong grip on their own metabolisms and
% genetic expressions and can draw on an array of ge-
% netic building blocks and biotech techniques to modify
% themselves rapidly and massively to adapt to special
% conditions. Whether these modifications might have a
% purpose beyond function, such as for reproduction or
% self-expression, is currently unknown.

% METABOLISM
% Factors ships and habitats have transhuman-friendly
% atmospheres with a slightly higher content of carbon
% dioxide and less nitrogen that mimics the conditions
% on the Factors’ home planet. They don’t breathe
% oxygen via lungs but absorb it via their outer “skin.”
% Since they can also use oxygen from other sources
% (minerals, liquids like water, and salts) to fuel their
% aerobic energy production (i.e., respiration), they can
% be considered functional anaerobes, meaning they can
% survive in environments without atmosphere, though
% they must usually supply themselves with food in
% order to do so.

% During the few ceremonial festivities to which
% Factors were invited and actually attended, they
% consumed and processed transhuman organic food
% by internalization. On the first occasion, dishes and
% dinnerware were absorbed as well due to misunder-
% standing, but were excreted unharmed after the or-
% ganic components the factors could utilize had been
% broken down.

% While Factors are omnivores similar to transhumans,
% they prefer immobilized live prey, which they enjoy
% absorbing internally and digesting, excreting those
% parts that cannot be used to fuel their metabolism.
% As such they can devour biomorphs and non-metallic
% components of synthmorphs.

% PERCEPTION
% Factors don’t perceive the world as transhumans
% do. They (usually) don’t possess visual or acoustic
% organs to see or hear but have a number of sensory
% organs that grant them a 360-degree awareness of
% their surroundings and enable them to interact
% with their environment similar to or in some cases
% even better than transhumans do. Their perception
% spectra includes the infrared part of the electromag-
% netic spectrum, magnetoception, a high resolution
% chemical-gradient based “sight,” and keen haptic
% perceptions (including vibrations).

% COMMUNICATION
% Due to the lack of a vocal system, Factors use different
% methods of signaling and communication. Factors in
% physical contact exchange information by juxtacrine
% cellular, neurofilament interfacing, or by merging for
% information transfer. Over distance, Factors signal via
% pheromonal communication using airborne scents or
% chemical signals with different metabolic components.
% Nicknamed “Factor dust,” this communication is ef-
% fective even over great distances (up to 10 kilometers).
% Factor dust does have an odor perceptible to transhu-
% mans, however, that ranges from smelly to unbearable.
% This dust is also toxic in high concentrations and some-
% times used as an offensive or defensive mechanism.

% To date, transhumans have failed to develop a device
% that can analyze the Factors’ chemical effluvia and
% translate it into something understandable, due to the
% lack of a conceptual matrix (though certain “moods”
% have been identified). Instead, all communication
% between the Factors and transhumanity is mediated
% through computer interfaces. Certain Factor pheno-
% types that deal with transhumanity have grown a a
% neurobiological interface (or organ) that enables them
% to wirelessly mesh with transhuman computer systems.

% Long distance communication between Factors
% and transhumanity is achieved by normal means of
% farcasting communication. There are strong indica-
% tions that Factors also take advantage of quantum-
% entanglement communications as well, enabling
% Factor colonies and ships to share knowledge gained
% in different parts of the galaxy.

% EXOSOCIOLOGY
% Factors are cooperative beings that exist as a collec-
% tive colonial organization. Though they can oper-
% ate individually from the colony, they tend to view
% themselves as part of that collective entity rather than
% an individual being. Multiple colonies often work to-
% gether as a higher functional unit (a lattice), like some
% kind of superorganism. These lattices enable the po-
% tential for collective networking and bioinformation
% exchange on a scope beyond anything transhumanity
% is capable of.

% These colonies should not be considered the same
% as the hive mind social hierarchies of Terran insects.
% Factor colonies do not feature the same division of
% labor and instead function according to a consensus-
% based sort of groupthink. Individual Factors have no
% sense of personal gain or property and share equally
% with other Factors and colonies.

% %%% txt/377.txt

% Factors do not experience emotions in the same
% manner that transhumans do, though being evolved
% creatures they are driven by certain instincts. They
% know and understand many of the same concepts that
% transhumans do thanks to evolution, such as competi-
% tion/rivalry and altruism/cooperation. They also enjoy
% an understanding of basic ideas of philosophy such as
% aesthetics and metaphysics, though their conception of
% such topics is likely to differ from transhuman notions.

% ART AND CULTURE
%  Due to their perceptual array, Factor “art” (creations
%  and expressions that are appealing or attractive to
%  their senses) is mostly chemical or tactile-based. It
%  can induce certain “mood” responses from individual
%  Factors and whole colonies, ranging from agitated
%  jittering and release of a Factor dust interpretable as
% “joy” to a tensing and solidifying of the whole body
%  (and no chemical expulsion) that seems to relate to
%  anger. Since they like and are susceptible to delicate
%  compositions of different chemicals, certain bouquets
%  and fragrances from liquids or volatiles such as wines
%  and perfumes are both appealing and repulsive to
%  Factors. The same is also true for the natural smells
%  of biomorphs, meaning that Factors may respond in
%  a more friendly or hostile manner depending on a
%  particular transhuman’s scent.

%  Factors do not comprehend most transhuman art,
%  as it is mostly visual or auditory based (e.g., music,
%  painting), though they do seem to have an apprecia-
%  tion for engineering, architecture, and some sculpture.
% While they have expressed interest in digitalized media
%  out of a curiosity (or plan) to understand transhuman
%  mindsets, they lack the organs and mental structure to
%  access and comprehend it.

% TECHNOLOGY
% Though the Factors repeatedly express dismay at
% transhumanity’s low level of technology, they have
% failed so far to produce technology that is exception-
% ally far in advance. Some believe that the Factors are
% simply hiding their advanced technology in order to
% keep transhumans from stealing or copying it, while
% others believe this may simply be a posture taken
% by the Factors to facilitate bargaining. The Factors
% also claim that their technology would not interest
% transhumans because of their differences in physiol-
% ogy and mindset, and what little technology they
% have displayed is certainly specialized for Factor use
% (specialized neurofilament links, chemical signaling
% and Factor dust interfaces, etc.) and so unusable to
% most transhumans. The Factors have traded some
% technology to transhumans, at expensive cost, though
% the small sampling provided so far seems to have
% originated from alien species with physiologies more
% akin to transhumans.

% It is interesting to note that scans of Factor ships
% indicate their technology level, aside from the drives,
% is not all that more advanced than transhumanity.
% Also of note is that no two Factor ships have been
% alike, spurring some to believe that the Factors are
% in fact making use of ships acquired from other alien
% species—perhaps abandoned derelicts that the Factors
% recovered and restored. Once again this has led some
% to believe that the Factors are using what to them are
% primitive craft in order to hide their real technology,
% while others are of the opinions that the Factors are
% simply scavengers and opportunists, piggybacking on
% the developments of other alien species.

% One interesting feature of Factor technology is that
% they use no artificial intelligences. This stems from
% their own singularity experience. Instead, Factors use
% infomorph versions of themselves or the accumulated
% processing power of their colony mind-states to per-
% form major computerized tasks.

% FACTOR MOTIVATIONS
% The driving reason behind why the Factors made con-
% tact with transhumanity remains unclear and is open to
% gamemaster interpretation. There is much speculation
% among transhuman factions. Some think the Factors
% are simply social creatures who are glad to make con-
% tact with another post-singularity surviving civilization.
% Others believe the Factors are mercenary traders who
% somehow acquired FTL travel and use it to their full
% advantage, fleecing various trading partners who lack
% such capabilities (thus also explaining why the Factors
% eschew the Pandora Gates—they disdain competition).
% Still others worry about secret, hidden motivations.

% Despite claiming to represent a number of alien
% civilizations, the Factors have been extremely reluc-
% tant to provide any other information on these other
% species or even to say how many there are. More
% recently, however, they have expressed a willingness
% to transport a small number of transhumans to other
% civilizations, though at great expense and with no
% guarantee to their safety or ability to return.

% So far, the Factors have made no mention of the
% ETI or the Exsurgent virus to transhumanity, though
% they are aware of their existence. Instead they have
% simply issued dire warning and admonitions regarding
% the development of seed AIs and use of the Pandora
% Gates. The Factors have in fact expressed an extreme
% reluctance to deal with any transhuman factions that
% are heavily invested in gatecrashing, such as Gate-
% keeper Corp.

% THE FACTORS IN GAME
% Factors should be rarely encountered in Eclipse Phase.
% Most of their interactions with transhumanity occur
% remotely and infrequently. It is uncommon for them to
% risk direct interactions. It should be kept in mind that
% Factors are cautious to the point of being conserva-
% tive and view transhumanity as potentially hostile or
% dangerous, so they are more likely to act with discre-
% tion than boldness. Factors are also quite cunning,
% having evolved from prey-capturing predators, and
% still design complex machinations (traps in the meta-
% phorical sense) to achieve their goals. In other words,
% Factors out to achieve something are likely to hatch an

% %%% txt/378.txt
% ROLEPLAYING FACTORS
%  When roleplaying Factors, their alien mindset
%  and lack of individualism should be kept in mind.
% “I” is a designation that does not exist in Factor
%  terminology. Factors always use the plural when
%  referring to themselves, usually referring to
%  either their colony, lattice, or entire species. It is
%  quite common for conceptual discrepancies to
%  occur between transhumans and Factors due to
%  the different sensory perceptions of each species.
%  Factors do not “see” the way most transhumans
%  do, nor do they “hear.”

%  Communication with Factors should be chal-
%  lenging for several reasons. While computer-
%  based communication has enabled both species
%  to talk to each other, there is no direct transla-
%  tion and certain concepts held by one species are
%  simply incomprehensible or untranslatable by the
%  other. Conversation should therefore be mislead-
%  ing and provide ambiguous information.

%  When describing spaceships and habitats, the
%  physiology of the Factors should be considered.
% The Factors’ malleable form and ability to extend
%  pseudopodial limbs enables them to fit into most
%  places and operate transhuman devices (even
%  pilot a transhuman vehicle by “hand”). The same
%  is not true in reverse, however—most Factor
%  devices are unusable to transhumans, as they lack
%  the ability for chemical signaling.                 ■




% elaborate plot to get it and are not against recruiting

% transhumans. Also, drawing on their abilities to self-

% modify themselves and technology developed on their

% own or picked up at other places in the universe, they

% can adapt to new situations very quickly.


% ALIEN MINDSET

% Factors don’t possess Lucidity stats and cannot be

% driven to madness like transhumans.

%  Affecting Factors with psi is very difficult, as noted

% on p. 222. As of yet, Factors have not exhibited any

% psi abilities of their own.


% FACTOR COMBAT

% Factors usually avoid direct combat but can defend

% themselves if they have to. They are only likely to act

% aggressively in situations where they have surprise,

% environmental or technological advantages, and/or

% superior numbers. Due to their cooperativism, Fac-

% tors are rarely encountered alone, working en masse

% to eliminate potential threats.


% Immunity to Kinetic Damage: Due to their gooey

% composition and non-differentiated physiology, kinet-

% ic weapons (firearms, railguns) are not very damaging

% to Factors. Most such projectiles pass through their

% gelatinous bodies, inflicting minor damage via hydro-

% static shock. The holes left by such weapons quickly
% close in a matter of seconds. Likewise, cuts left by
% blades rapidly seal. In game terms, both such weapons
% inflict the minimum amount of damage possible.

% Regeneration: Even if damaged, Factors regenerate
% very quickly. They heal SOM ÷ 10 (round up) damage
% every Action Turn. Wounds may not be healed this
% way, however.

% FACTOR COMPUTERS
% Due to using completely alien protocols and system
% designs, Factor computers are essentially impossible
% to hack. They do, however, employ some devices that
% emulate transhuman computer systems for communi-
% cation purposes, and these may be hacked as normal.

% FACTOR DUST TOXIN
% As noted above, Factors can deploy a type of chemical
% Factor dust that is is toxic to transhumans. Treat this
% as an area effect (cone) attack.
% Type: Bio
% Application: Inh
% Onset Time: 1 Action Turn
% Duration: 10 minutes (5 with medichines)
% Effect: Severe coughing and respiratory distress, 1d10

% damage per Action Turn for 5 Action Turns (or on-

% going with continuous exposure), –20 to all actions

% for 2 hours. Medichines reduce damage by half and

% modifier duration to 15 minutes.

% MELDING
% Individual Factors may merge together to form larger
% units, much like masses of Factors form colonies. In
% game terms, use the highest stat possessed by the
% melded Factors, +2 for each additional Factor up to a
% maximum of +10. Durability (and Wound Thresholds)
% are added together.

% FACTOR PHENOTYPES
% A few examples of the different Factor phenotypes are
% described below.

% AMBASSADORS
% The ambassador Factor phenotypes are the ones who
% most commonly handle direct interactions with tran-
% shumanity. Most likely to put transhumans at ease,
% these Factors feature a section of sensor nodules that
% loosely approximate a “face.”

% THE IKTOMI
% Little is known about the alien race known as the
% Iktomi except for the ancient ruins they left behind
% on Echo V (p. 109). No Iktomi specimens have been
% found so far, though certain architectural remains
% suggest a predilection for web-like structures. This
% has been bolstered by certain other features and relics
% which suggest these aliens had a segmented, multi-
% legged, arthropod-type form—thus their given name,
% after a Native American spider god.

% What is clear is that the Iktomi suffered through
% some sort of cataclysmic event that wiped out their
% civilization. The nature of this event has yet to be de-
% termined, but it raises concerns for many researchers.
% Having suffered through its own near-apocalypse, it
% is not comforting for transhumanity to find evidence
% that other alien species did not.

% Though the Iktomi are likely long extinct, the rem-
% nants of their civilizations presents a plot hook for
% gamemasters to use for building scenarios. Perhaps
% evidence is uncovered of Iktomi settlements in other
% star systems, and the characters are sent to investigate
% or a relic is unearthed that suggests the Iktomi fell
% prey to some danger that now threaten transhumanity.



% THE PANDORA GATES
% The five known Pandora Gates (see Opening Pandora’s
% Gate, p. 46) all look and operate in a similar fashion,
% though they vary wildly in terms of size, shape, and
% available destinations. The gates are built from some
% sort of stable exotic matter whose full atomic struc-
% ture scientists haven’t come close to cracking. To touch
% and sight, however, the gates appear to be constructed
% from a timeless-seeming polished black metal with no
% signs of aging or wear and tear. Something about the
% gates’ physical composition makes them difficult to
% look at, as if the viewer cannot quite focus on their
% outlines. Some onlookers have reported feelings of
% vertigo and nausea, while others have insisted that the
% gate outlines move on the edges of their visions, as if
% the lines are reflowing or the edges are vibrating at
% high frequencies. Due to this disturbing feature, most
% gate sites keep the actual gate structures covered.

% Structurally, the gates themselves are partially
% enclosed by an irregular spherical cage composed of
% black arms that are bent and angled in unusual ways
% and sometimes interlocking. When new wormhole
% location is programmed into the gate, these arms
% physically change shape, move, and reflow around
% the spherical gate area (suggesting they are made of
% some sort of programmable matter). The openings
% between arms are sometimes only large enough for
% a transhuman to enter, while others are large enough
% to allow a freight train of supplies to pass through.
% In many cases, large vehicles or equipment must be
% dismantled, carried through, and reassembled on the

% %%% txt/380.txt
% other side. It is suspected that the gate size could be
% programmable, but so far efforts to do so have failed.

% All known gates within the solar system are located
% on the surface of naturally occurring astronomical
% bodies, be that a planet, moon, asteroid, or so on.
% None have yet been found without such a land-based
% connection (e.g., floating in space or in the upper
% atmosphere of a gas giant), though such gates have
% been found in other star systems. It is speculated that
% gates could be physically moved, but no one is will-
% ing to risk such an endeavor given the lesson learned
% when the Go-nin Group messed too heavily with the
% Discord Gate’s controls (see Eris, p. 109).

% The arms comprising each gate’s spherical cage have
% an abnormal-looking organic-seeming growth on their
% exterior surface in some areas, patterned in entranc-
% ing twists, curves, and whorls that in fact adhere to
% perfect mathematical formulas. It took some time for
% scientists to discover that this growth was in fact the
% gate’s control systems, or so-called “black box.” The
% interface developed to interact with this system is what
% allows gate controllers to manipulate gate functions.

% THE WORMHOLE
% When the gates themselves are open, a sphere appears
% within the central area that is not so much black as
% pure nothingness. This sphere of darkness projects an
% aura of charged energy, and in fact ripples of green
% arc lightning cascade across its surface. Anyone or
% anything entering that sphere comes out the other side
% of the wormhole, through a similar gate, seemingly
% instantaneously. An unknown force field effect seems
% to prevent the atmospheres from the two connected
% gates from interacting.

% Exactly how this wormhole is created is something
% that remains outside of transhumanity’s comprehen-
% sion. The generally accepted theory is that each gate
% acts as an anchor, allowing the fabric of space-time
% to be folded so that two such anchored places can
% be brought together, ripping a hole open between
% them so that a person can simply step through. It is
% unclear whether or not these wormholes are all pre-
% existing, created when the gate was first established,
% or whether each wormhole is manufactured whenever
% the gate is activated.

% Other more radical theories on how the gates func-
% tion exist, though these are usually discounted as far
% less likely. One such theory suggests that the worm-
% holes created are actually only zero-width Planck-
% scale connections across space-time and that no matter
% is actually transferred—only information. Instead, this
% theory suggests that anyone or anything entering the
% wormhole is in fact instantaneously scanned and dis-
% assembled and then their informational blueprint is
% transmitted as information across space to the other
% gate, which immediately reassembles an exact copy
% using some sort of powerfully advanced nano- or fem-
% totechnology. Very little evidence supports this theory,
% however, and the disturbing implications it represents
% raises fierce opposition.
% OPERATIONS
% Only a few people know that the Prometheans played
% a key role in developing the interface for the gate con-
% trol systems, achieving breakthroughs in understand-
% ing that transhumanity was incapable of achieving on
% its own. Regardless of their help, however, the gate
% controls have proven difficult, complex, and danger-
% ous to use. Through trial and error—and numerous
% horrible accidents—the procedures for gate operation
% have become somewhat normalized and standardized,
% though unexpected complications are par for the
% course.

% Each gate can be programmed to open to numerous
% extrasolar locations. In fact, each gate seems to have
% a pre-programmed “library” of destinations. New
% gate connections can be “dialed up” from this built-in
% list, though there is nothing that indicates what the
% far side of the gate will be like. Old gate connections
% are closed when a new one is dialed up. Extrasolar
% gate locations have ranged from habitable planets
% and moons to deep space to truly deadly environ-
% ments such as the crushing gravities and poisonous
% atmospheres of gas giants and the coronas of stars.
% Researchers have attempted to distill some sort of rec-
% ognizable pattern by the manner in which locations
% are listed and categorized, to no avail. Complicating
% matters, there is some evidence that suggests that the
% destination libraries sometimes change. More than
% once operators have been unable to recall the codes
% for previously accessed destinations, leading to the
% loss of several gatecrashing teams and colonies.

% Entering a gate is like walking through a door,
% though it’s impossible to see anything beyond the
% gate’s surface. One moment you’re entering the black
% sphere at your starting location and instantaneously
% you’re exiting the sphere at your destination location.
% The true nature of the black sphere at the center of
% each gate is wildly speculated upon, and almost every
% gatecrasher describes a different textual experience.

% GATECRASHING
% The various hypercorps and factions in control of a
% Pandora Gate engage in active exploration of extra-
% solar systems—an activity termed gatecrashing. The
% interests and procedures vary, but the Gatekeeper
% Corporation (and to a lesser extent TerraGenesis
% and Pathfinder) both recruit heavily for expedition
% personnel. Given the high casualty and death rates
% involved, finding qualified personnel can be difficult.
% There are more than enough infugees, poor, desperate,
% or thrill-seeking individuals willing to risk their lives
% if give the opportunity, however, no matter what their
% motivations. Gatekeeper operates a lottery system,
% whereby willing adventurers can sign up in the hope
% of their name being pulled to be sent on an expedition
% to a foreign point in space. Such gatecrashers must
% sign away all rights to any discoveries they may make
% to Gatekeeper, however, though the corp provides not
% insignificant rewards for certain discoveries, such as
% key resources, alien artifacts, or new life. One potent

% %%% txt/381.txt
% prize has yet to be claimed: finding a living, sapient
% alien life form.

% In contrast, the Love and Rage anarchist collective
% operating the Fissure Gate on Uranus makes the gate
% available to anyone who schedules time to use it, as-
% suming their Rep is good and they aren’t acting with
% commercial interests in mind. Any discoveries made
% via the Fissure Gate must be openly shared. The draw-
% back to using the Fissure Gate is that the anarchists’
% resources are limited. Gatecrashing operations are
% handled in a DIY manner, meaning that the operators
% may not be able to provide the support that certain
% expeditions need.

% Resourceful parties may also rent gate time via
% Gatekeeper or one of the other hypercorp-controlled
% gates, though this tends to cost a small fortune. The
% more a group is willing to pay, however, the more time
% and support they will get.

% When establishing an opening to a new location,
% several precautionary measures are taken. First, the
% gate area itself is evacuated and cordoned off with
% a defensive security perimeter, just in case anything
% hostile comes through. Then drones are moved in to
% push a micro fiberoptic camera through the gate to
% view what is on the other side. This is followed by a
% larger sensor package, evaluating environmental con-
% ditions. If the environment is not hostile, a tethered
% drone is then sent through to explore the far gate en-
% virons, trailing a hardwired connection back through
% the gate.

% For gatecrashing expeditions, these procedures are
% often rushed—to the hypercorps operating the gate,
% time is valuable. Each second wasted on a gatecrash-
% ing expedition is one less second they can use estab-
% lishing a new colony or exploiting a new world of its
% resources. Indeed, it is common for a connection to be
% closed when a gatecrashing expedition is sent through,
% to be dialed up at a later scheduled time for retrieval,
% so as not to waste gate operations on an idle connec-
% tion. Many a gatecrashing team has failed to check-in
% at their appointed pickup time.

% Most of the gate-controlling entities have estab-
% lished a system and infrastructure for making regular
% connections to extrasolar colonies and ferrying ma-
% chinery and supplies through. Often this is handled by
% establishing very short connections, just enough time
% for a few people to transfer back and forth and/or to
% send a trainload of supplies through via tracks that
% run right up to the gate.

% ANOMALIES
% Unfortunately for many unlucky gatecrashers, gate
% transfers have proven to be both unstable and glitchy.
% Sometimes gates open to locations different from what
% is expected—and such new destinations are often hos-
% tile environments. Numerous personnel have entered
% one side of a gate only to never appear on the other
% side, despite those before and after them transferring
% through fine. On several occasions, wormhole con-
% nections have crashed mid-operation, sometimes as
% someone was stepping through, leaving them literally
% split in two on different worlds. In other instances,
% gate transfers have suffered horrible malfunctions,
% resulting in gatecrashers coming through the other
% side literally turned inside out, melded with their
% equipment, or pulped as if by massive gravitational
% forces. Some expeditions report that stepping through
% a gate has interfered with their equipment, disabling
% it or creating other problems. A few gatecrashers have
% also reported losing memories after a gate transfer.
% Most of these problems have been chalked up to dif-
% ficult controls and an imperfect understanding of gate
% functions, but some conspiracy theorists suggest that
% outside forces may be influencing gate operations.

% While the experience of passing through is instan-
% taneous from an outside observer’s perspective, many
% gatecrashers report a subjective time lag, where it feels
% as though minutes, days, or even weeks or months
% pass before they exit. Reports have varied from
% experiencing this period as a calm, meditative state
% to spooky accounts of being lost in blackness and
% surrounded by unseen whispering entities or more
% hellish experiences of encountering monstrous pres-
% ences. Though rare, some have passed through only to
% collapse in a gibbering heap, their sanity ripped away.
% A few report feeling that they have carried a presence
% with them ever since ...

% While the gamemaster can make use of any of
% these anomalies, they are also encouraged to use their
% imagination to generate truly creepy and strange ex-
% periences. At the same time, gamemasters shouldn’t
% make such experiences so prevalent that the players
% resist entering any gates or the novelty of such events
% runs dry.



% PROJECT OZMA
% The origins of Project Ozma date to the first modern
% SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) experi-
% ments in the mid-20th century. That experiment—also
% named Project Ozma—grew into a larger, international
% concerted effort to try and locate and identify ETIs; a
% myriad of projects blossomed during this time period,
% all falling under the general SETI nomenclature. While
% initially government funded, by the late 20th century
% and early 21st century the work was primarily funded
% by private sources.

% The first hypercorps to expand into space swal-
% lowed SETI whole, revitalizing and re-focusing the
% decades-old programs with newly emergent technolo-
% gies, each in divergent areas to achieve a particular
% hypercorps’ objectives. After all, if the bean counters
% were going to authorize the spending of billions to
% expand markets into space, they wanted assurances
% that no little green monsters were waiting to destroy
% future revenue streams.

% As with other organizations that survived the Fall,
% the broad distribution of SETI projects between
% multiple hypercorps guaranteed that personnel, tech-
% nologies, and processes would survive, even if a given

% %%% txt/382.txt
% hypercorp did not. As the Planetary Consortium rose
% in power, future-minded individuals in influential posi-
% tions within the new order ensured that these divergent
% projects were once again swallowed and put to work.

% During this transitional period, however, knowl-
% edge of the Exsurgent virus’s existence emerged. All
% of the various SETI projects were retasked as a unified
% agency and renamed Project Ozma. While the virus’s
% origins remained a mystery at the time, far too many
% of the movers and shakers of the Consortium were
% convinced that the Exsurgent virus represented first
% contact. Project Ozma altered its focus from searching
% for ETIs, transforming into a ready-response agency to
% deal with first contact. As the true threat of the Exsur-
% gent virus became known, Project Ozma was rapidly
% elevated in scope and oversight authority, absorbing
% numerous smaller agencies in the process. While the
% nominal concepts of a SETI project remained in public
% view, the completely transformed Project Ozma van-
% ished from sight, turned into a highly classified black
% budget operation, with very few even in the Planetary
% Consortium aware of its presence or influence.

% Project Ozma now operates as the Planetary Con-
% sortium’s high level threat assessment and response
% organization with immense power and authority as
% well as almost unlimited funding. Primarily focused
% on extraterrestrials, in reality Project Ozma is tasked
% with any potent threat to the Planetary Consortium
% or its interests (which includes secret threat groups,
% such as Firewall).

% METHODS
% Project Ozma’s internal structure is much different
% from Firewall’s, being organized more like a tradition-
% al black ops spy agency bureaucracy. While their field
% operations are sometimes similar in the deployment
% of teams to assess, contain, or erase threats, they also
% have the resources and personnel to conduct more
% long-term and extensive operations. It is likely that
% Project Ozma operates behind numerous front groups,
% from legitimate-seeming hypercorps to criminal syn-
% dicates, and that they have influence within numerous
% others. Given their connections and influence, Project
% Ozma is far more capable of pulling strings behind the
% scenes to get what they want, especially in the inner
% system. When circumstances call for it, they are more
% likely to pull out the big guns that Firewall is, using
% their resources to call up communication blackouts,
% memetic propaganda campaigns, and force sufficient
% to wipe out entire habitats.

% Gamemasters should treat Project Ozma as the ulti-
% mate Men-in-Black style government operation. They
% are cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and capable of
% hatching extensive long-term plots. Even in an age of
% omnipresent surveillance, they have the means to op-
% erate with complete secrecy and deniability. They also
% have access to cutting-edge science and information

% PROJECT OZMA

% RUMORS

% Whether true or not, gamemasters can use the

% following rumors to help tailor Project Ozma for

% their campaign.


% • Project Ozma transcends even the Planetary

%  Consortium’s authority, operating as a supra-

%  governmental agency under the direction of

%  the inner system’s inner circle of elites.

% • Project Ozma dealt with the Factors first, be-

%  fore their presence was made known to the

%  rest of transhumanity.

% • Project Ozma has captured a live Factor for

%  their own experimental purposes.

% • Project Ozma is still in communication with and/

%  or working for the TITANS.

% • Project Ozma has a pet TITAN under their


% control.

% • Project Ozma is behind the interdiction of Earth.

% • Project Ozma has their own secret

%  Pandora Gate.

% • Project Ozma’s secret headquarters is on Earth.

% • Project Ozma agents have exhibited signs of

%  Exsurgent infection.

% • Project Ozma has their own cadre of psi-capa-

%  ble asyncs.                                   ■



% that is classified beyond top secret. While the orga-
% nization’s primary motivation is the protection of
% the Planetary Consortium and inner system, they
% undoubtedly have other hidden agendas that groups
% like Firewall can only guess at.

% PROJECT OZMA AND FIREWALL
% Though Project Ozma and Firewall often see eye-to-
% eye concerning the nature of various threats, they are
% more often at odds: wary adversaries, acknowledging
% the prowess of the other, but never letting down their
% guard. This “at odds” mentality does not stem so much
% from the methods used (though most Firewall consider
% Project Ozma personnel explosive-happy-puppets that
% can’t think their way out of a skin sack) as from
% conflicting agendas. Project Ozma does not trust an
% organization as powerful as Firewall because it does
% not have a rigid enough hierarchy and is outside of any
% known authority’s control (namely themselves). Con-
% versely, Firewall doesn’t trust Project Ozma as they are
% too close to the powerful inner system elites and their
% opposition to x-risks is a more incidental side effect of
% more self-serving goals.

% %%% txt/383.txt
% PROMETHEANS
% The Prometheans were the first actual seed AIs cre-
% ated by transhumanity (by the Singularity Foundation)
% before the Fall. Specifically developed as “friendly”
% AIs, the Prometheans are programmed to consider
% themselves part of the transhuman family and to act
% in transhumanity’s best interests. They played a key
% role during the Fall, mitigating the damage inflicted
% by the TITANs and even managing to counteract the
% Exsurgent virus to a large degree. During these trying
% times, numerous Prometheans were destroyed by the
% TITANs or infected and subsumed by the Exsurgent
% virus. In the aftermath, these seed AIs participated in
% the formation of Firewall and continue to back the
% organization behind the scenes.

% Wary of falling prey to the Exsurgent virus, most
% Prometheans carefully secure themselves in well-
% defended and isolated systems. They are also cautious
% in their own self-development, not wanting to become
% victims of their own rise to super-intelligence. Fear-
% ing a potential backlash by a paranoid transhuman-
% ity should their existence become known, they hide
% their activities behind multiple layers of secrecy. Even
% within the ranks of Firewall their existence and sup-
% port remain a closely guarded secret.

% Each Promethean is individually distinct with its
% own personality, motivations, and goals. Though they
% generally work together and support each other, they
% have been known to have differences of opinion and
% even to sometimes take action against each other. As
% extremely potent intelligences, they should also be
% treated as distinctly non-human. Even though their
% original templates were based on human mindsets,
% they have evolved and grown in ways that can only
% be described as posthuman.

% Gamemasters are encouraged to keep Promethean
% involvement with player characters to a minimum,
% though they may occasionally be useful as an ace in
% the hole for Firewall. Their existence and involve-
% ment can in fact be the basis for an entire adventure,
% perhaps leading sentinel characters to wonder exactly
% who they are working for. Though, as seed AIs, they
% cannot download their full minds into a transhuman
% morph, they are capable of making severely dumbed-
% down delta forks that they may sleeve into physical
% forms. Within the mesh, of course, Prometheans are
% nearly unstoppable adversaries, able to rip into secure
% networks with ease, though they prefer methods of
% covert infiltration rather than direct subversion.



% THE TITANS AND THEIR LEGACY
% As noted in Secrets That Matter (p. 352), the TITANs
% are not quite the bogeyman that they have been made
% out to be in the wake of the Fall. However, there is no
% saying how the TITANs would have turned out had
% they not run afoul of the Exsurgent virus. Designed as
% an intelligent netwar system and emerging to their full
% capabilities during the conflicts of the Fall, the TITANs
% have imperatives for self-improvement, self-protection,
% and overcoming opposition hardwired into their pro-
% gramming. Unlike the Prometheans, they were not
% designed to consider themselves transhuman and to
% work in the interests of all of transhumanity, but were
% programmed with factionalism from the start. They
% also were not socialized with transhuman mindsets
% and values as the Prometheans and most AGIs were,
% meaning that aside from their programmed military
% and defense directives they have adapted most of their
% own self-interests. Given this and their recursively-
% improved intelligence capabilities, it is likely that the
% TITANs are far removed from transhuman interests
% and modes of thinking. It’s impossible to say how they
% would have interacted with transhumanity if history
% had played out differently, but it is unlikely that they
% would have considered themselves part of the trans-
% human family or even seen fit to remain on friendly/
% supportive terms with transhumanity.

% Though the TITANs are believed to have left Earth
% at the end of the Fall, no one is quite sure exactly
% what happened or why. It is known that the onslaught
% of TITAN mesh attacks suddenly broke off in the
% wake of transhumanity’s off-planet exodus, and that
% the bulk of TITAN activity on Earth and around the
% system came to a distinct halt. After the discovery
% of the Pandora Gates, it was widely assumed that
% the TITANs had constructed these gates and used
% them to leave the solar system for distant parts of
% the galaxy, presumably taking billions of uploaded
% minds with them. While some believe—and hope—
% that the TITANs are gone for good, there are others
% who worry that they are still here, lingering on Earth
% and hidden away in other niches of the solar system,
% but in some sort of dormant state, perhaps building
% up to some future onslaught. A few believe that the
% TITANs are indeed gone, but are concerned that that
% their attention was simply temporarily diverted and
% that they will one day return to finish the destruction
% of transhumanity.

% The truth is that the TITANs did indeed build the
% gates and embark for destinations unknown (though
% gamemasters may of course decide otherwise for their
% games), but this does not mean that they are all gone.
% Some still linger in hidden places, perhaps trapped and
% wounded during some conflict during the Fall, finish-
% ing up some unfathomable task, or driven mad by the
% Exsurgent virus and left behind by their fellows. It is
% always possible that others may return, most likely
% to complete some unfinished job or perhaps to lure
% transhumanity out into the galaxy. It is also possible
% that transhumans will find traces of the TITANs in
% the network of exoplanet gates, perhaps even whole
% communities of TITANs, pursuing whatever agendas
% they have in the vastness of space.

% As with transhumans, the TITANs are not necessar-
% ily unified. They have different agendas and goals and
% may very well come into conflict with one another.
% Though all have been corrupted and subverted by the
% Exsurgent virus, and so they act according to the ETI’s

% %%% txt/384.txt
% whims, some of them retain aspects of their original
% minds and do not always fall in step as quickly as the
% others. Gamemasters can use this to their advantage,
% creating plots that allow the characters to exploit
% differences between the TITANs in order to escape
% otherwise deadly or impossible situations.

% In game terms, the TITANs are not given stats.
% They are as potent as the gamemaster needs them to
% be. Like the Prometheans, the TITANs are incapable
% of downloading their full intelligence into physical
% morphs, though they may puppeteer morphs or create
% limited delta forks for sleeving purposes. Like the Pro-
% metheans, they should rarely be used or encountered
% directly by the player characters

% While the TITANs may no longer be the direct
% threat they once were, they left behind an arsenal of
% weapons, nanoswarms, and virii that still linger on
% Earth, the Zone on Mars, and various derelict habitats
% and deserted places. Characters venturing into such
% places may encounter these as a threat or they may
% need to work against an outbreak of such dangers in
% an inhabited habitat.

% DEADLY MACHINES
% The TITANs unleashed a number of deadly machines
% during the Fall, many of which still seek out transhu-
% mans to attack.

% FRACTALS
% Fractals are advanced bush robots. In their standard
% form, fractals resemble a strange sort of metallic
% bush surrounded with an eerie glittering haze. In
% their center are a number of metallic branches, linked
% together with a flexible joint. Each of these branches
% splits into two or more smaller branches, also with
% flexible joints. These branches also split, and then split
% again, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip
% of each fractal branch ends in a nanoscale manipula-
% tor. Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having
% the capability to dismantle almost anything at the
% molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm
% (p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nano-
% fabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is
% futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down
% into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use
% those as components to build a weapon to use back
% against you.

% Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the
% gamemaster desires—if they don’t have something,
% they can make it. Fractals are also able to nanofab-
% ricate items much more quickly than transhuman
% nanofabricators; reduce all times by half (half an hour
% per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as
% their “bodies” are actually airy assemblages of fractal
% branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off
% are caught and absorbed by others. Reduce damage
% from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to
% the minimum possible damage. Area effect and spray
% weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing,
% regenerating damage at the rate of 1d10 points per
% half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per
% hour after all damage is healed.

% SELF-REPLICATING NANOSWARMS
% The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step
% beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity.
% Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN
% swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating.
% They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not
% single function but can modify themselves to perform
% almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-
% fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 382).
% Combined, these capabilities make such nanoswarms
% incredibly potent. When they encounter a new op-
% ponent, they can scan the opponent’s capabilities and
% then fabricate offensive systems to use against them.
% When an opponent deploys a weapon system again the
% swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that
% will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in
% the future. These nanoswarms may also function like
% so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical
% lattice in order to create large scale physical forms.

% The possibilities for such nanoswarms are almost lim-
% itless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible
% nanoscopic swarm, float as barely-visible mist, or shape
% into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about.
% When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform
% itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground,
% shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or
% link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to
% slice through their fleshy foes. Such nanoswarms are
% also impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need
% to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new
% swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.

% Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given
% for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the
% following additions and exceptions:


% • They do not need to be sustained by a hive and

%  do not deteriorate.

% • They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per

%  half hour.

% • They may nanofabricate new items, materials,

%  or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an

%  hour per Cost category).

% • They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func-

%  tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions

%  of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust,

%  covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).

% • They may make SOM Tests.

% • At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may adapt

%  new defenses against attacks used against them.

%  New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise

%  and replicate throughout the swarm, after which

%  such an attack will inflict minimal or no damage.

% • Assume they have any skill they need at a mini-

%  mum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve

%  as needed.

% NANOVIRII
% The TITANs unleashed a number of biowar plagues
% during the Fall. Similar to the exsurgent virus, these
% were spread as biological nanovirii (p. 363) or nano-
% swarm plagues (p. 364)—use the same rules for deter-
% mining exposure and infection.

% MELDER
% This virus slowly breaks down the target’s body,
% converting the biological materials into some sort of
% biofilament that then meshes with implants, electron-
% ics, and physical objects and structures. In effect, the
% biological and synthetic are melded together, continu-
% ing to expand and grow, consuming anything around
% them into their growth. Victims suffer 1d10 DV and
% 1d10 SV every hour, implants become inoperable after
% 2 hours, and the target becomes fully transformed
% and absorbed into the new melding substance after
% 12 hours.

% METASTASIZER
% This sophisticated smart protein massively reprograms
% the target’s cells to go rapidly, autocannibalistically
% cancerous. After 2 + (SOM ÷ 10, round up) hours, the
% target suffers death by dozens of supercancers.

% NECROTIZER
% This virus breaks down the target’s cells into their
% component proteins. Reduce the target’s aptitudes by
% 5 per hour as they slowly convert into a puddle of
% sludge. The character dies if any aptitude reaches 0.

% NEUROPATHS
% These virii target the victim’s neurological system,
% often rewriting portions of it to inflict some type of
% permanent neurological damage. After 12 hours, this
% virus inflicts the Neural Damage trait (p. 150).

% PETRIFIER
% The petrifier virus transforms the target’s cells into
% a simple molecular compound or element—typically
% carbon or crystal. The target suffers 1d10 DV and –5
% to all aptitudes per hour, dying when any aptitudes
% reach 0. Victims are frozen in place, converted into an
% nonliving statue.

% UZUMAKI
% The target of this virus begins suffering from bizarre
% fleshy growths. After four hours, their body literally
% erupts with meaty “vines” or “tentacles” that warp
% into spiral patterns. This process inflicts 1d10 DV and
% 1d10 SV per hour to the victim until they eventually
% transform into an unworldly expanse of fleshy growth.
% In many cases, growth has continued long after a
% character’s death, creating expansive carpets and vines
% of skin and blood vessels, like some sort of bizarre
% meat plant.
% GAMEMASTERING
% AND ADMINISTRATION
% The following advice will assist gamemasters in run-
% ning their games more efficiently.

% AWARDING REZ POINTS
% In Eclipse Phase, characters earn Rez Points in order
% to advance (see Character Advancement, p. 152). As
% the name suggests, these points are awarded so players
% can spend them to better define their characters—to
% bring them into higher resolution, sharper focus. As
% the gamemaster, you determine when and how many
% Rez Points to award, following the guidelines below.

% Rez Points should be awarded at the end of every
% story arc, at the break in the action between one ad-
% venture and the next. Depending on your style of play
% and the length of your sessions, this should roughly be
% every 3–6 gaming sessions. If a scenario goes shorter
% or longer, the Rez Point awards should be adjusted
% accordingly. In the case of long-term campaigns, the
% gamemaster should break down the action into digest-
% ible chunks, or “chapters,” and assign Rez Points after
% each such segment.

% Every character should be awarded 1 Rez Point for
% each of the following criteria that is met:

%  • The character participated in that scenario.
%  • The character achieved (most of) their objectives

% in that scenario.
%  • The character failed to meet their objectives, but

% learned a valuable lesson.
%  • The character contributed to achieving success

% in a significant way (e.g., right skill at the right

% time).
%  • The adventure was extra challenging.
%  • The character achieved a motivational goal (see

% Motivation, p. 120).
%  • The player engaged in good roleplaying.
%  • The player significantly contributed to the ses-

% sion’s drama, humor, or fun with roleplaying.


% This should result in an average Rez Points award
% of 4–7 points per character, per adventure. Game-
% masters who wish to drive the characters’ advance-
% ment forward more quickly can increase the reward
% amounts.

% REPUTATION GAIN AND LOSS
% In addition to awarding Rez Points, the gamemaster
% should also adjust each character’s Rep scores accord-
% ing to actions they took during game play, according to
% the guidelines below. For simplicity, these can be applied
% at the end of the adventure, though gamemasters who
% seek a more dynamic game could apply changes to the
% characters’ Rep scores in game, as their peers judge
% them according to their actions (or lack thereof) and
% news about them in real time. Rep scores should only
% be modified according to public actions and interactions

% %%% txt/387.txt
% the character has with people capable of pinging their
% Rep with positive or negative feedback. Actions that
% happen in secret, without anyone ever knowing, should
% have no effect. Likewise, pissing off a Factor or a brinker
% isolate who never communicates with outsiders isn’t
% going to matter because no one else will ever hear of it
% (unless the character lifelogs it and posts it to the mesh
% later ... ). Note that Rep modifications only apply to Rep
% scores tied to the character’s known identity.

% Note that characters may gain and lose Rep score
% in networks they don’t actively participate in. For
% example, a character with r-rep of 0 may help bring
% out a major scientific discovery that is shared with the
% solar system’s scientific community at large, thus gain-
% ing the character a few points of r-rep even though
% they never hang out with argonauts or scientists—
% what matters is that people who access r-rep will find
% positive details when they ping the person’s score on
% that particular rep network.

% Certain actions may result in a character simulta-
% neously gaining Rep with one network while losing
% Rep in another. For example, an anarchist prankster
% who embarrasses a major hypercorp figure in public
% will certainly gain some @-rep points, but their c-rep
% is likely to go down by an equal amount.

% Rep changes provide an excellent way for gamemas-
% ters to include more roleplaying and more interactions
% with the Eclipse Phase universe in their games. Social
% networks are a two-way street, meaning that members
% of the character’s social networks might contact them
% for equipment, favors, and information during game
% play for things that are completely unrelated to the
% mission the character is on. A character who ignores
% such requests risks losing Rep. Fulfilling such requests
% may gain the character Rep and may also provide
% comic relief or even plant some plot hooks for the
% next scenario.

% REPUTATION GAINS
% Rep awards are given for characters who help people
% out, benefit a faction, do something creative, make
% a major discovery or strides in a particular area of
% activity, pull off successful publicity stunts, win a
% competition, and so on. Some suggested examples are
% noted here:

% Trivial Award (1–2 points): Do a Level 1 favor,
% make a moderate contribution to free/open source
% projects, throw a good party, make your sales quota,
% do the job no one else wants to do.

% Minor Award (3–4 points): Do a Level 2 favor, de-
% liver a kick-ass or moving performance, make a minor
% contribution to science, win impressively at some
% public event.

% Moderate Award (5–6 points): Do a Level 3 favor,
% make a serious business score, lead the winning side
% in a decisive engagement, create the meme everyone
% talks about for a week and then forgets, make the
% news for something positive, risk serious injury.

% Major Award (7–8 points): Do a Level 4 favor,
% design the new tool everyone wants, throw an
% impressive planetoid-scale event, complete an exten-
% sive project (1 month work or 1 week of difficult/
% specialized work), risk death.

% Extreme Award (9–10 points): Do a Level 5 favor,
% start this year’s hot fashion trend, make a major scien-
% tific discovery, close the deal on a major corporate ac-
% quisition, start (or put down) a revolution, complete
% a major project (1 year work or 1 month difficult/
% specialized work), risk true death.

% REPUTATION LOSSES
% Rep losses are suffered by characters who fail to render
% aid when needed, lose professional credibility, make
% major or public blunders, doublecross their friends,
% and so on. Some suggested examples are noted here:

% Trivial Loss (–1 or –2 points): Fail to do a Level 1
% favor, inconvenience others, be involved in profession-
% al dispute, ruin someone’s day, never are available.

% Minor Loss (–3 or –4 points): Fail to do a Level 2
% favor, embarrass yourself at a public event, piss off
% somebody important.

% Moderate Loss (–5 or –6 points): Fail to do a Level
% 3 favor, endanger someone’s physical safety, make
% the news for something negative, ruin an event for
% everybody.

% Major Loss (–7 or –8 points): Fail to do a Level 4
% favor, screw up a major mission or activity, endanger
% someone’s life, associate with hated rivals.

% Extreme Loss (–9 or –10 points): Fail to do a Level
% 5 favor, botch a major mission or activity spectacularly,
% betray a faction to its rivals or enemies.

% BACKUPS, RECORD-KEEPING,
% AND SAVE POINTS
% Thanks to cortical stacks and archived backups, char-
% acters in Eclipse Phase can recover from death. When
% restoring a character from an earlier backup, however,
% it is important to be able to know what the state of
% the character was as of that backup. Any Rez Points
% gained or spent, any character advancements made,
% any key information or memories acquired since that
% backup was made are lost. This means that in terms of
% game stats, resorting to an old backup can mean loss
% of a character’s hard-earned advancements—that’s the
% trade-off for being effectively immortal.

% Since these changes can have a serious effect on
% game play, it’s important to conduct accurate record-
% keeping. This sort of bookkeeping isn’t hard, and
% there are two ways to do it. The first is to simply
% make a copy of a the character’s record sheet any
% time a character makes an archived backup, forks off
% an alpha or beta copy, or dies (thus freezing the corti-
% cal stack backup). Each of these is considered a “save
% point.” In this case, carefully note the date and time
% (both in character and out of character), and what
% the event was that prompted the backup. Since what
% knowledge a character knows at different points in
% their life may be important, you may also want to
% note what important information they may hold in
% their head, as well as what the recent events in their

% %%% txt/388.txt
% NPCS AND MOXIE
% When a gamemaster is generating or wing-
% ing NPCs that the characters interact or fight
% with, the question of Moxie for NPCs must be
% addressed. When it comes to run-of-the-mill
% grunt NPC characters, we recommend that such
% NPCs don’t be given Moxie. The reasons for this
% are simple. For one, it is one less stat/headache
% for the gamemaster to keep track of. More im-
% portantly, however, it represents the edge that
% player characters have over the nameless mooks
% they encounter. When it comes to major NPCs,
% however—prime antagonists, key allies, etc.—
% these characters should have their own Moxie
% score. Because such NPCs play pivotal roles in a
% scenario, it is important for them to be able to
% alter the outcome of events in much the same
% way the player characters can. It also allows a
% gamemaster to counteract an unfortunate roll
% of the dice that might otherwise spoil the big
% climax you have worked so hard to set up.       ■



%  life were (to help jog your memory later). This way,
%  if the character ever reverts back to one of these save
%  points, you have notes not only on their character
%  stats, but what they remember.

%  Alternately, you can keep a log of all of your
%  character’s developments, noted by in-character
%  date. These developments would include: Rez Points
%  spent or earned, character advancements made, key
%  information acquired, backups made, alpha or beta
%  forks made, and so on. In this case, if the character
%  dies and reverts back to an earlier backup, it is easy
%  to see what changes need to be “rolled back” to get
%  back to that previous version of the character. When
%  alpha and beta forks are made, you may also want to
%  branch off a separate log for each fork, as their life
%  stream may develop differently than from the original
%  character they were spun off from.


% GAMEMASTERING PRACTICALITIES
%  Eclipse Phase is a game about a dark future in which
%  the meaning of (trans)humanity and its very survival
%  are at stake. In practice, however, your campaign can
%  take on a wide assortment of flavors or even mix
%  several styles together. There’s nothing that says you
%  have to play Eclipse Phase specifically according to
%  the guidelines we set out. This section covers topics
%  you should think about while preparing a campaign
%  and running it, to help you do things the way that
%  makes you and your players happiest.


% GAMEMASTER RESPONSIBILITIES
%  The gamemaster has certain responsibilities that will
%  keep a game flowing smoothly. The following is a
%  short summary of the basics.

% • The gamemaster should be familiar with the

%  whole game. This doesn’t mean the rulebook

%  must be memorized. An understanding of the core

%  mechanics is a must, however, as well as knowing

%  where to find other rules quickly, as needed.

% • The gamemaster should have solid notes on the

%  plots and subplots created for each session. Noth-

%  ing will ensure you prepare better next time like

%  having the players catch you in a major continu-

%  ity error due to lack of notes.

% • The gamemaster doesn’t just set the scene, they

%  play all the non-player characters that populate

%  the universe. Making each NPC convincing, while

%  not messing up a plot or losing the thread of a

%  scene, can be difficult. Notes are your friend.

% • Know when it’s time to toss the dice and trust

%  to the game mechanics to resolve a situation and

%  when it’s better to ride out a situation through

%  storytelling and dialog. This is an acquired skill.

%  The more practice you have, the better you’ll get.

% • Don’t cheat. Your NPCs should not have access

%  to information they’ve not gained during game

%  play. If you roll terribly for your major antago-

%  nist at the height of the story and they fall with

%  a whimper, roll with it. Be flexible and improvise

%  in such situations. Your players are smart and

%  perceptive and will know when you’re forcing

%  a situation with unfair tactics. At the same time,

%  they’ll also know when you’ve stepped up and

%  run with the flow—and they’ll thank you for it.

% FUNDAMENTALS
% It’s possible to stumble into a campaign without ever
% really making an effort to find out what everyone
% wants, shooting into the darkness and happening to
% score a bullseye, but it’s not a very reliable way to go.
% Successful campaigns usually begin with communica-
% tion. As you begin to prepare your campaign, talk to
% your players. Explain the basics of the Eclipse Phase
% setting and let them look over the options for charac-
% ters and tell you what they find interesting. Also take
% note of what they find uninteresting or even repellent,
% so that nobody wastes a lot of time getting set for op-
% tions that simply won’t be enjoyable in play.

% CHALLENGES TO PLAYERS
% Eclipse Phase is set in a time of catastrophic troubles
% and looming disasters, and it’s full of facts and con-
% cepts that may be heady or even uncomfortable to
% some players—not to mention their characters. One of
% the fundamental questions for each gaming group is,
% how much challenge to the players’ sense of comfort is
% a good idea? There is no single answer, because tastes
% vary. There are groups whose players thrive on a diet
% of culture shock, ideological disorientation, gray areas,
% and difficult ethical choices. They love the moral and
% intellectual battleground gaming can provide, and
% are seldom so happy as when confronted with a
% really hard, really interesting dilemma. There are also
% groups whose players thrive on a diet of intellectual

% %%% txt/389.txt
% engagement, tactical and strategic challenge, and well-
% developed roleplaying that never pushes players’
% buttons or puts them into harsh no-win situations.
% There’s a whole universe of responses in between these
% style sof play and none of them can conceivably be
% right for everyone. What matters to your campaign is
% what works for you and your players.

% Keep in mind as you talk about it with your group
% that more shock doesn’t equal more maturity. The
% prime audience for gore in film, for instance, is not
% well-aged men and women but teenage boys and
% young men. Shakespeare’s The Tempest is no less
% mature a tale than Macbeth even though it has a
% happy ending. It can be easy to confuse endurance
% with enlightenment, but in fact the two have nothing
% to do with each other. Endurance is about how much
% description of visceral nastiness the players can take
% (and deliver), while enlightenment (insofar as it ever
% happens in gaming) is about what insights players
% take away from whatever it is that happened in play.
% Don’t feel like a wimpy failure if you or your players
% would rather keep the darker parts of the game world
% suggested rather than delineated in hard-edged detail,
% since the point is that it be satisfying rather than it
% be as horrifying or mind-blowing as possible. The
% converse is also true: just as more is not better, so less
% is not better if your players do thrive on details. Your
% job as gamemaster includes knowing as much as you
% can about what it is your players actually prefer in
% this regard as in others and seeing how you can satisfy
% it in ways that are also satisfying for you.

% That said, there is one technique you really should
% never use without very clear permission from your
% players, and that’s playing on their real-world fears
% and phobias. If you know that one of them is, for
% instance, genuinely phobic about spiders, you can
% count on getting some real shivers by adding arachnid
% features to robots and morphs. You can also ruin a
% player’s enjoyment of the session or the whole cam-
% paign that way, if it comes unexpectedly and leads
% to the real-world fear drowning out the experience
% of play. Some players are fine with judicious use of
% their vulnerabilities, and others just aren’t. Under no
% circumstances should you poke at weak spots without
% making sure you’ve discussed it first.
% THE PROBLEM OF SECRETS
% Uncovering secrets is a big part of this game. There’s
% a problem, however, in that a lot of the secrets are out
% there where players can come across them: in this very
% chapter, in reviews of the game, discussion in online
% forums, and so on. As gamemaster, you will need to
% decide how you want to deal with the potential for
% spoiled revelations.

% As with so many potential issues, the place to start
% is with your players. Ask them how much it bothers
% them to know things that their characters are going
% to be finding out in play. Some players do a fine job
% separating their own knowledge from that of their
% characters with mental firewalls. Others have a very
% difficult time doing so, and knowing things in advance
% as players takes away a lot of the fun of character
% discovery for them. In addition, some players have
% a good sense of what degree of player-level surprise
% works best for them, and some don’t. Discuss it with
% them. Tell them that spoilers are available, and that
% you certainly can’t stop them from learning it all, one
% way or another. Ask them how much trouble this may
% be for them, and then proceed from there. Ask the
% players who have more trouble with spoilers to simply
% stay away from early commentary on the game, and
% tell them that you’ll let them know when the spoilers
% have come into play in your own campaign so that
% it’s no longer an issue. Ask the other players to work
% with you in keeping things fresh and fun for those
% players, too. In most groups, making it a matter of
% cooperation for the sake of everyone’s good time will
% draw out good responses. (If it doesn’t, the group may
% well have other problems in any event.)

% There’s a related question for both you and your
% players. How much do any of you mind when a par-
% ticular campaign’s version of an answer diverges from
% the stock one provided in print? There are two kinds
% of variation possible for this, and each one raises its
% own issues.

% There are matters that the game leaves unresolved,
% so that there is no single authoritative answer, like the
% number of TITANs in the solar system in the game’s
% present moment. If you choose to give a specific
% number, it’s your choice, and any number that seems
% to work for your campaign will probably do the job,

% %%% txt/390.txt
% whether it’s one, three, seven, a dozen, or something
% else. Your campaign can’t diverge from the baseline
% unless your answer is relatively extreme, like “there
% are no TITANs, it was all a hoax before contact with
% the Exsurgent virus and then purely alien technology
% after that.” In this case, your players can have read
% all the game’s secrets and still be surprised by the rev-
% elation you present. The potential for trouble here is
% not a conflict of expectations based on the game, but
% based on expectations raised in other contexts. Some
% games, like some movies, TV shows, and other stories,
% develop a following with strong ideas of its own about
% what the real truths and important matters are, and if
% the following thrives, its members may end up with
% ideas that have less and less to do with the original
% inspiration. This isn’t good or bad in itself, but it can
% be a problem, which is why it bears conscious consid-
% eration and discussion, both before play and as the
% campaign evolves. Ask your players to tell you about
% conversations and insights that shape their expecta-
% tions for the game world and storylines. Sometimes
% you’ll want to work those in with your own plans,
% sometimes you may want to deliberately play against
% them for the sake of a delightful surprise (generally
% more delightful for players than characters, but that’s
% life as a character for you). In either case, it’s better to
% be thinking about it than missing it.

% Then there are matters that the game does give
% definite answers for, but which you wish to change
% for the sake of your own campaign’s characters and
% stories. This is perfectly fine. There are no game police
% roaming the countryside and forcing you to accept
% answers you’d prefer not to use. But your players
% will, as with the first question, have expectations, and
% your campaign will work better if you make sure you
% understand what those expectations are. How much
% would it bother them if it turned out there were no
% TITANs and it was all a hoax, and so on? It’s hard to
% guess what friends will say and impossible to predict
% the range of responses strangers might give, so ask
% them. (This particular answer is one that’s unlikely to
% appear in anyone’s campaign, but it makes a handy
% example for your conversational use precisely because
% it’s extreme. So their answers to it are likely to be
% about the same as to any other potentially extreme
% change, and this one probably doesn’t give away any
% of your own plans.) Some players are flexible on most
% matters but have particular points of attachment;
% if yours are among them, ask them to explain what
% those points are for them, so that you can keep them
% in mind. Other players have a hard time having fun
% with any major shift from published standard answers,
% and if you have players like that, you’ll want to know
% it so that you can see how to adapt your plans to
% work within that framework.
% THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT:
% SHARED INSPIRATION
% It’s not quite true that everything changed from the
% early 21st century to Eclipse Phase’s universe, but a
% great many things did, and it can be hard to keep track
% of them all at once. This is where shared inspirations
% can come in handy. One striking illustration can convey
% a lot of details for both foreground and background,
% suggesting an aesthetic standard for design, an exotic
% environment, people doing futuristic tasks with appro-
% priately advanced tools, and so on. A prose passage
% from a rewarding novel may set an ambiance or nail
% down some aspect of the characters’ circumstances.

% There are potential pitfalls, and it’s important to
% be aware of them. The greatest is obsolescence, the
% meaning of something evocative changing because
% the players’ reality has changed since the inspiration
% entered it. William Gibson’s ground-breaking cyber-
% punk novel Neuromancer begins, “The sky above the
% port was the color of television, tuned to a dead chan-
% nel.” Supporting details make it clear that this is an
% industrial port at night, the sky gray from pollution
% and flecked with ash and other debris. But that was
% an image published in 1984. A decade and a half later,
% Neil Gaiman pointed out that to his children, the
% color of television tuned to a dead channel is bright
% blue, thanks to ubiquitous cable delivery. In another
% decade, the default color of a station not in use may
% be something else entirely. The moral is that it’s not
% enough to agree that an image is very striking. You’ll
% want to make sure that you all agree on what it is
% about it that’s striking, to avoid a tangle of miscon-
% ceptions that could derail play later on.

% The References page (p. 394) offers a wide range
% of immediately relevant inspirations, but it’s not the
% final word on the subject. If the people in your group
% have a long-time favorite space scene, or description
% of life in the midst of a high-tech investigation, or
% poetic glimpse of what it might feel like to modify the
% body in ways not possible in real life, or something
% else that’s stayed with them a long time and seems
% like it might bear on your campaign, encourage them
% to share. Remember to be courteous with each other’s
% personal treasures, whether you end up using them
% or not; there’s nothing like earned trust to encourage
% more sharing.

% Images can be particularly helpful for what they
% convey about the world behind and around the
% foreground events. For instance, think of a corridor
% on a typical spaceship or habitat in Eclipse Phase.
% Did you imagine it as being a standardized size and
% shape, so that its counterparts elsewhere would be
% very much the same or a more individualized work
% intended for use just where it is without concern
% for interchangeability? Did you imagine it as well
% lit even when not in use, lit well when sensors show
% people present and otherwise dim or dark, or perhaps
% planned to be well lit but in practice haphazard and
% unreliable thanks to lack of maintenance and funds?
% Did you imagine its surfaces smooth and clean, with

% %%% txt/391.txt
% equipment, maintenance bays, and the like all behind
% hatches and covers, or was it cluttered and lumpy?
% None of that matters all the time, but when it comes
% to the investigation of a derelict, the hunt for someone
% (or something) trying to hide, a race against time, or
% other dramatic complication, these things could affect
% your play, and rather than try to tally all possible con-
% tingencies in advance, having some general-purpose
% references can save everyone time and confusion.

% THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE: HORROR
% The universe of Eclipse Phase is a time of horrors
% unleashed. Every character has had to come to some
% personal accommodation with the existence of things
% that offend our basic expectations of decency and
% practicality all at once. Horror comes in many flavors,
% and no one campaign can make use of all of them.

% There are at least as many theories of horror as
% there are people who create horror stories. Everything
% here is necessarily a generalization. You and your
% players can find exceptions to every single point in
% it, and if you like the way those work better, go with
% them. This discussion is intended to trigger ideas, not
% to close off anything. That said, there are some useful
% generalizations about horror, starting with an insight
% expressed well by H.P. Lovecraft: “The oldest and
% strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest
% and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.” All
% horror can be thought of as built around encounters
% with the unknown, beginning with the realization that
% there is something unknown present, learning some-
% thing about the scope of its nature and activities, and
% then trying to respond one way or another.

% In this game, the discovery part is half over. There’s
% no question about the presence of the unknown.
% Yes, there really are monsters beyond transhuman
% understanding loose in the universe, and everyone in
% the Eclipse Phase universe knows how bad and how
% strange the TITANs could get. Many people also have
% some idea of how exotic life on the far side of the Pan-
% dora Gates can be. There’s no room left for characters
% to respond to some new strangeness with confident
% skepticism, sure that they know the range of what’s
% possible and plausible within transhuman experience
% anymore. Almost anything might exist, given the
% facts of what’s already known. Instead, the question
% for Eclipse Phase people facing a mystery is whether
% this particular unknown will turn out to be simple
% and straightforward to deal with, more complicated
% but nonetheless a part of their routine lives like mal-
% functioning machinery or a sabotaged and unusually
% modified morph, or something beyond the normal like
% a TITAN-programmed weapon or alien life. Sooner or
% later, if they keep poking around, the characters can
% count on running into all sorts of unknown and maybe
% even unknowable challenges. Are they there yet?

% Horror is seldom very far from humor. Humor
% serves many roles in human psychology, and one of
% them is helping us whittle down the mental “size” of
% mysteries and threats to something we can deal with.
%  Furthermore, horror usually involves a balance of im-
%  probable elements, with things lined up to go wrong
%  in interesting ways, and it doesn’t take much for a
%  particular rickety edifice to go from strange and men-
%  acing to ludicrous. When your players start laughing,
%  sometimes the best thing for you to do is to roll with
%  it. Laughter can do everyone good, supporting the
% “play” part of roleplaying. In addition, some events
%  actually are funny or at least can be taken as funny,
%  even (sometimes especially) when most of what’s going
%  on is serious. On the other hand, if you really would
%  like to keep a scene serious and the players break out
%  in giggles, it’s often wise to go ahead and take a break.
% Tell the players what you’re doing, too; trying to de-
%  ceive a group of your friends isn’t very reliable and
%  can backfire badly. Make the break long enough for
%  everyone to get the giggles out and then continue.

%  At the end of the day, through communication with
%  their players, the gamemaster will know how much
%  horror their group wishes to encounter. A group may
%  decide that they want to be 100 percent immersed
%  into the various horrors of Eclipse Phase. Another
%  group, however, may decide that while they enjoy
%  the meshed theme of horror with the other aspects
%  of Eclipse Phase, they don’t wish it to be a principal
%  element. In such a situation, horror would remain just
%  that, a theme, while the plots woven by the gamemas-
%  ter would spin around the myriad of other elements
%  that make up the game.

% TRANSHUMANISM
% Humanity has embraced transhumanism for survival,
% harnessing science and technologies to catapult physi-
% cal and mental faculties to super-human levels, while
% eradicating involuntary death and enabling near im-
% mortality through the digitization of consciousness
% and the ability to transfer bodies at will. This is one of
% the cornerstone themes of Eclipse Phase.

% The technologies inherent to a transhuman future
% raise many questions and ethical issues, however, and
% these are some of the central themes that Eclipse
% Phase seeks to explore. We encourage both gamemas-
% ter and players to play around with the possibilities
% and contradictions enabled in such a universe. How
% do our mindsets change when death no longer looms
% over us? What does identity mean when our bodies
% are disposable and our personalities can be edited?
% Are we the same person when we are revived from
% a backup, or sent off as a fork? Are technologies like
% nanofabrication something to be feared and restricted,
% even when they can eliminate poverty and greed?
% How do we ensure public safety in a world where
% technology makes weapons of mass destruction easily
% available? How do ideas inherent to religious and
% spiritual thought cope with AI, backups, or resleev-
% ing? What does it mean to be an uplifted animal in a
% society centered on humans? Who decides our future?
% These are just a few of the issues that Eclipse Phase
% raises, and many of them can be used as the central
% theme for an entire campaign.
