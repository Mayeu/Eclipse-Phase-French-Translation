 Dedication: This book is dedicated first and foremost
  to the people who made Eclipse Phase happen, from
  everyone who contributed time, sweat, ideas, and
  money into it to everyone who picks it up, reads
  it, and plays it. This game is by you and for you.
  Secondly it’s dedicated to my grandmother and to
  Andrea, both important people in my life who died
  while I was working on this book and its themes
  of defeating death. I sincerely hope that one day
  such tragic losses are avoided. Third, this book is
  dedicated to my son Echo, my entertaining working
  companion on this project. Finally this book is dedi-
  cated to those visionaries, especially the anarchists
  and transhumanists, who are working to bring about
  a fantastic future, starting now. —Rob Boyle
