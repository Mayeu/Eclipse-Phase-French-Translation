   [Something is not right here.] Sava kicked at one of the
skeletons. The bones rattled and cracked. [I don't see
any skulls.]
   [Forced uploading,] Sarlo transmitted. [TITAN machines
harvested the heads of the dead for scanning.] He shrugged.
[That's my guess, anyway.]
   [Shut up!] Sava signaled the team to silence. [Who
else hears that?]
   A low mechanical whir reverberated nearby. [I'm
picking it up.] Pivo replied. [Up a bit to the north. About
30 meters.] As if in response to Pivo's observation, an-
other whir began, this one behind the team, from the
south end of the hangar. Another whir from the east
joined in the chorus. The sounds were coming closer,
becoming more distinct, more aggressive.
   [No visual, yet. This fucking place is so deep and thick with
this dust shit, seems to act like chaff too. Infrared is giving me
only about twenty feet!] Sava motioned for the team to
move to the right. [Stay close, we move slow and keep the
triggers itchy. The passenger lounges are just east of us. We
start the search there.] The whirs were now all around
them, hovering just outside visual range.
   [What the fuck is that?] A flying insectoid bot with
six articulated arms ending in small buzzsaws lunged
from the dusty darkness at Berk, who dropped to
the floor and unleashed plasma fire into it. The bot
slammed into a pile of bones and rags and set it alight.
The fire spread quickly, leaping from dry cloth to dry
cloth. The blazing hangar floor now illuminated the
area in the hot orange glow of flame. At least a dozen
insectoid bots hovered in a perimeter around the team,
awaiting an opportunity to strike. Another bot dove
at Berk, its buzzsaw arms slashing wildly. Berk fired,
but missed. The bot slammed into Berk's head and
the buzzsaws ground into her neck. Sparks flew in all
directions as metal met metal. She dropped her rifle
and pushed against the body of the bot till the saws
were off her neck. [Fucking run you idiots! I've got this!]
   Sava fired and dropped a bot, then dashed east,
leaping over spreading waist-high flames. [Make for the
lounge!]
   Pivo elevated onto two arms and ran behind Sava,
his five remaining arms flopping wildly above his
head. [Out of the way, ya poke!] Sarlo outpaced the
slower octomorph, running through the flames to-
wards the lounge.
   Berk flung the frenzied bot into a flaming pile of
bones, scrambled to her feet, and followed after the
