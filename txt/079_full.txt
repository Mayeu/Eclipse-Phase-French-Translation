The stations and swarms adhering to these
ideas have bonded together under a loose
autonomist alliance, a mutual aid pact
to help each other in times of crisis and
present a united front against the inner
system powers and Jovian Junta. There is
little formal structure to this alliance as an
entity unto itself; it primarily exists as an
assortment of joint resolutions agreed to
by its various member habitats and a few
ad hoc task forces dedicated to address-
ing a particular problem or issue and then
dissolving. Delegated ambassadors act
as negotiators with outside powers, but
these have limited authority and are held
strictly accountable.
