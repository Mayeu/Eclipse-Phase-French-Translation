 In every game, there comes a time when the gamemas-
 ter must decide if a character succeeds or fails in an
 action. This is when the players roll dice and the char-
 acters' stats and abilities come into play. This chapter
 defines the core mechanics and rules that govern the
 outcomes of events in Eclipse Phase.

 THE ULTIMATE RULE
 One rule in Eclipse Phase outweighs all of the others:
 have fun. This means that you should never let the
 rules get in the way of the game. If you don't like a
 rule, change it. If you can't find a rule, make one up.
 If you disagree over a rule's interpretation, flip a coin.
 Try not to let rules interfere with the game's flow and
 mood. If you're in the middle of a really good scene
 or intense roleplaying and a rule suddenly comes into
 question, don't stop the game to look it up and argue
 about it. Just wing it, make a decision quickly, and         you roll two ten-sided dice, choosing one to count first,
 move on. You can always look the rule up later so            and then read them as a result between 0 and 99 (with

 A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY AND GENDER
 The Eclipse Phase setting raises a number of interesting questions about gender and personal identity.
 What does it mean when you are born female but you are occupying a male body? When it comes to lan-
 guage and editing, this also poses a number of interesting questions for what pronouns to use. The English
 language has a bit of a bias towards male-gendered pronouns that we hope to avoid in these rules.
   For purposes of this game, we've sidestepped some of these gender neutrality quandaries by adopting
 the “Singular They” rule. What this means is that rather than just going with male pronouns (“he”) or
 switching between gendered pronouns (“he” in one chapter, “she” in the next), we have adopted the use
 of “they” even when referring to a single person. To some folks, this is bad grammar, but there is actually
 some good evidence that this usage has strong historical roots (look it up), and it certainly gives our edi-
 tors fewer headaches.
   When referring to specific characters, we use the gendered pronoun appropriate to the character's
 personal gender identity, no matter the sex of the morph they are in.                                    ■
