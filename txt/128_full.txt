category, which is used during character generation
and any time the gamemaster wants to keep costs
simple. See the Gear Costs table on p. 137.

IMPLANTS
Implants include cybernetic, bionic, genetech, and
nanoware enhancements to your character's morph
(or mechanical enhancements in the case of a synthetic
shell). These implants may give your character special
abilities or modify their stats, skills, or traits. Some
morphs come pre-equipped with implants, as noted in
their descriptions (see p. 139). You may also special-
order morphs with specific implants (see Morph Ac-
quisition, p. 277). If you want to upgrade a morph
you are already in, you can undergo surgery or other
treatments to have an enhancement installed (see
Healing Vats, p. 326. For a complete list of available
implant/enhancement options, see pp. 300-311, Gear.

PSI
Psi is a rare and anomalous set of mental abilities that
are acquired due to infection by a strange nanovirus
released during the Fall. Psi abilities are not completely
understood, but they give characters certain advan-
tagesâ€”as well as some disadvantages. A character
requires the Psi trait (p. 147) to use psi abilities, which
are called sleights. Psi users are called asyncs. A full
explanation of psi and details on the various sleights
can be found in the Mind Hacks chapter, p. 216.
