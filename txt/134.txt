ORIGINAL SPACE COLONIST
You, or your parents, were part of the first “gen-
erations” of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to
stake a claim in space, so you are familiar with the
cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older
stations and habitats. As a “zero-one G” (zero-gravity,
first-gen), you were never part of the elite. People from
your background typically have some sort of special-
ized tech training as vacworkers or habtechs.

RE-INSTANTIATED

survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body

with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead
storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave.

CHOOSE FACTION
After choosing your background, you now choose
which primary faction your character belongs to.
This faction most likely represents the grouping that
controls your character’s current home habitat/station,
and to which your character holds allegiance, but this
need not be the case. You may be a dissident member
of your faction, living among them but opposing some
(or all) of their core memes and perhaps agitating for
change. Whatever the case, your faction defines how
your character represents themself in the struggle be-
tween ideologies post-Fall.
  You must choose one of the factions listed below.
Like your character’s background, it will provide your
character with certain skills, traits, limitations, or
other characteristics.
  The factions presented here outline the most numer-
ous and influential among transhumanity, but others
may also exist. At your gamemaster’s discretion, you
may develop another starting faction with them not
included on this list.

ANARCHIST
You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of
social organization and directly democratic decision-
making. You believe power is always corrupting and
everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect
their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive
policies of the Inner system and Jovian Junta, this
makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a ter-
rorist at worst. In your opinion, that’s comedy coming
from governments that keep their populations in line
with economic oppression and threats of violence.
Advantages: +10 to a skill of your choice, +30 Net-
  working: Autonomists skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All

ARGONAUT
You are part of a scientific techno-progressive move-
ment that seeks to solve transhumanity’s injustices and
inequalities with technology. You support universal
access to technology and healthcare, open source
models of production, morphological freedom, and
democratization. You try to avoid factionalism and
divisive politics, seeing transhumanity’s splintering as
a hindrance to its perpetuation.
Advantages: +10 to two Technical, Academic: [Field],
