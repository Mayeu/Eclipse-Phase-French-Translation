           Tai is making a character. She decides to create a sal-
           vage retrieval/scavenger type who started as a Lunar
           Colonist but is now a Brinker. Together, her background
           and faction give Tai +20 Networking: Autonomists skill,
           +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill, +10 Pilot: Spacecraft

           skill, and +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill. She also has +10
           to two other skills (one Academic, Professional, or Tech-
           nical) that she’ll choose later.
              Tai starts with 105 points for aptitudes, which works
           out to 15 each. She wants her character to be impulsive
           and antisocial, so right away she lowers both SAV and




STARTING APTITUDES
Your character receives 105 free points to distribute
among their 7 aptitudes: Cognition, Coordination,
Intuition, Reflexes, Savvy, Somatics, and Willpower
(see Aptitudes, p. 123). (That breaks down to an aver-
age of 15 per aptitude, so it may be easiest to give
each 15 and then adjust accordingly, raising some and
lowering others.) Each aptitude must be given at least
5 points (unless you take the Feeble trait, see p. 149),
and no aptitude may be raised higher than 30 (unless
you take the Exceptional Aptitude trait, p. 146). Note
that certain morphs (flats and splicers, for example)
may also put a cap on how high your aptitudes may
be (see Aptitude Maximums, p. 124).
   For simplicity, it is recommended that aptitude
scores be handled as multiples of 5, but this is not a
necessity.

NATIVE TONGUE
Every character receives their natural Language skill
at a rating of 70 + INT for free. This skill may be
raised with CP (see below).

STARTING MOXIE
Every character starts off with a Moxie stat of 1 (see
Moxie, p. 122).

CREDIT
All characters are given 5,000 credits with which to
purchase gear during character creation, unless you
have the Fall Evacuee or Re-instantiated background
(in which case you start with 2,500 or 0 credits, re-
spectively). See Purchasing Gear, p. 136, for more
details.

REP
Your character isn’t a complete newbie. You get 50
rep points to divide between the reputation networks
of your choice (see Reputation and Social Networks,
p. 285).

SPEND CUSTOMIZATION POINTS
Now that you have the basics of your character
fleshed out, you can spend additional Customiza-
tion Points (CP) to fine-tune your character. Each
WIL to 10. She also wants to be smart and fast on her
feet, so takes the extra 10 points that gives her and
raises both COG and REF to 20. So her aptitudes are:

COG COO        INT     REF      SAV     SOM    WIL




                                                          EXAMPLE
 20  15         15      20       10      15    10

   She marks down her Moxie of 1 and gets her native
language (Chinese) at 85, both for free.
   Noting her 5,000 Credits, Tai divides her Rep score
points evenly among @-rep and c-rep, taking 25 in each.

  character is given 1,000 CP, which may be used to
  increase aptitudes, buy skills, acquire more Moxie,
  buy more credit, elevate your Rep, or purchase posi-
  tive traits. You may also take on negative traits in
  order to get even more CP with which to customize
  your character. This customization process should be
  used to tweak your character and specialize them in
  the ways you desire.
     If a gamemaster seeks a different level of gameplay,
  they can adjust this CP amount. If the gamemaster
  wants a scenario where the starting characters are
  younger or less experienced, they can lower the CP
  to 800 or even 700. On the other hand, if you want
  to create characters who start off as grizzled veterans,
  you can raise the CP to 1,100 or even 1,200.
     Not all customizations are equal—aptitudes, for ex-
  ample, are considerably more valuable than individual
  skills. To reflect this, CP must be spent at a specific
  ratio according to the specific boost desired.


        CUSTOMIZATION POINTS
        15 CP = 1 Moxie point
        10 CP = 1 aptitude point
         5 CP = 1 psi sleight
         5 CP = 1 specialization
         2 CP = 1 skill point (61-80)
         1 CP = 1 skill point (up to 60)
         1 CP = 1,000 credit
         1 CP = 10 Rep
        Trait and morph costs vary as noted.


  CUSTOMIZING APTITUDES
  Raising your aptitude score is quite expensive at 10
  CP per aptitude point. As noted above, no aptitude
  may be increased above 30. Keep in mind that your
  morph may also provide certain aptitude bonuses.

  INCREASING MOXIE
  Moxie may be raised at the cost of 15 CP per Moxie
  point. The maximum to which Moxie may be raised
  is 10.
