SYLPHS
Sylph morphs are tailor-made for media icons, elite
socialites, XP stars, models, and narcissists. Sylph
gene sequences are specifi cally designed for dis-
tinctive good looks. Ethereal and elfin features are
common, with slim and lithe bodies. Their metabo-
lism has also been sanitized to eliminate unpleasant
bodily odors and their pheromones adjusted for
universal appeal.

FURIES
Furies are combat morphs. These transgenic human
upgrades feature genetics tailored for endurance,
strength, and reflexes, as well as behavioral modifica-
tions for aggressiveness and cunning. To offset tenden-
cies for unruliness and macho behavior patterns, furies
feature gene sequences promoting pack mentalities and
cooperation, and they tend to be biologically female.

FUTURAS
An exalt variant, futura morphs were specially crafted
for the “Lost generation.” Tailor-made for acceler-
ated growth and adjusted for confidence, self-reliance,
and adaptability, futuras were intended to help tran-
shumanity regain its foothold. These programs proved
disastrous and the line was discontinued, but some
models remain, viewed by some with distaste and
others as collectibles or exotic oddities.
