                       SKILL LIST AND NECESSARY SKILLS
                               Every character will want a few key skills, and there's
                                    a list of every skill to reference, as well. ■ p. 176




                APTITUDE-ONLY TESTS
      In rare cases, a test may be called for in which no
        particular skill applies. In this case, one or more
                    aptitudes are used instead. ■ p. 174




LANGUAGES
Many languages are spoken throughout the solar system. The
mesh makes instant translations easy, but despite this, many
people are still versed in two or more languages. ■ p. 181
