    COMPLETE SKILL LIST
   This section details all of the learned skills avail-
   able in Eclipse Phase. Gamemasters and players
   may, of course, agree to add additional skills to
   this list as appropriate to their campaign.

    ACADEMICS: [FIELD]
   Type: Field, Knowledge
   Linked Aptitude: COG
      What it is: Academics covers any sort of spe-
   cialized non-applied knowledge you can only get
   through intensive education. Most theoretical and
   applied sciences, social sciences, transhumanities,
   etc. are covered by this skill. Most of the other
   skills listed in this chapter could also be taken as
   an Academics field, reflecting a working theoretical
   knowledge of the skill—for example, Academics:
   Armorer or Academics: Interrogation.
      When you use it: Academics is used when a
   character wishes to call upon a specific body of
   knowledge. For example, Academics: Chemistry
   could be used to identify a particular substance,
   understand an unusual chemical reaction, or deter-
   mine what elements are needed to nanofabricate
   something that requires exotic materials. At the
   gamemaster's discretion, some Academics-related
   tests might not be defaultable, given that only
   someone who has been educated in that subject is
   likely to be able to tackle it.
   Sample Fields: Archeology, Astrobiology, As-
      tronomy, Astrophysics, Astrosociology, Bio-
      chemistry, Biology, Botany, Computer Science,




NECESSARY SKILLS
While characters will need a mix of skills to
ucceed in the varied tasks they encounter in
 clipse Phase, some skills are crucial for any
haracter. If a character lacks these, they will
 ave a difficult time getting by, so it is impor-
ant for players and gamemasters to know
hese particular skills.
  Fray: Fray is the primary skill you use to avoid
 etting hit in combat. Even if you plan to avoid
ombat, being able to get out of the way when
 ecessary is a handy survival skill to have.
  Networking: Unless you live in total isolation,
ou need a Networking skill—preferably several.
 etworking is how you interact with people in
  particular social circle to obtain information,
pread rumors, call in favors, and so on.
  Perception: Perception Tests get called for
 uite often, so if you want your character to
 now what's going on around them, make sure
o get this skill. Investigation and Scrounging
 re also good, but Perception is king.          ■
