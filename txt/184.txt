PALMING
Type: Active, Physical
Linked Aptitude: COO
  What it is: Palming is the skill of handling items quick-
ly and nimbly without others noticing. Palming is not
only about dexterous manipulation of objects but also
relies heavily on obfuscation, timing, and misdirection.
  When you use it: Use Palming any time you are
trying to conceal an item on your person, shoplift,
pick a pocket, surreptitiously discard something, or
perform a magic trick. Palming is an Opposed Test
against the Perception of any onlookers. The game-
master may wish to make this roll secretly.
Specializations: Pickpocketing, Shoplifting, Tricks

PERCEPTION
Type: Active, Mental
Linked Aptitude: INT
  What it is: Perception is the use of your physical
senses (including cybernetic) and awareness of the
physical world around you. Perception differs from
Investigation in that it is noticing things by chance,
rather than actively searching for something.
  When you use it: Use Perception whenever you
wanted to take a detailed account of your surround-
ings (see Detailed Perception, p. 190). Perception
can also be considered an Automatic Action (see
Basic Perception, p. 190) and so the gamemaster may
call for a Perception Test to determine if you notice
something; it is recommended that such tests be rolled
secretly by the gamemaster. Perception is also used as
an Opposed Test whenever someone around you is
trying to be sneaky with Infiltration or Palming.
Specializations: Aural, Olfactory, Tactile, Taste, Visual
