PERSUASION
Type: Active, Social
Linked Aptitude: SAV
  What it is: Persuasion is the art of convincing
someone to do what you want through the use of
words and gestures. This does not include persuasion
through threats or force (that is covered by Intimida-
tion) or by lying (covered by Deception).
  When you use it: Use Persuasion any time you are
trying to bargain with, convince, or manipulate some-
one. This can include motivating your subordinates or
peers to take action, seducing a companion, winning
a political debate, or negotiating a contract, among
other things. Persuasion is handled as an Opposed
Test against the target’s WIL + WIL + SAV when one
person is simply trying to win over another. If both
parties are trying to convince each other, make it an
Opposed Test between Persuasion skills.

NANOFABRICATION
Nanofabrication is use of Programming skill to create
objects using a cornucopia machine, fabber, or maker
(p. 327). If you have appropriate blueprints and raw
materials, most uses of a nanofabricator can be treated
as a Simple Success Test (p. 118). If you wish to create
an item for which you do not have blueprints or the
proper raw materials, however, or you wish to alter an
item’s design, then a Nanofabrication Test is called for.
See Nanofabrication, p. 284.

Protocol allows you to navigate treacherous social

NEGATING SOCIAL GAFFES
Sometimes a player will make a mistake that their
character never would, whether that’s failing to stand
in the presence of hypercorp royalty, confusing a gang
leader for a peon, or accidentally insulting someone’s
heritage. In cases like this, the player may make a Pro-
tocol Test for the appropriate field in order to negate
the gaffe. If successful, the character never actually
screwed up, or at least managed to cover their tracks
without ruffling any feathers.
