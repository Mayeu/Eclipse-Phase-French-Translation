 COMBAT SUMMARY
- Combat is handled as an
     Opposed Test.
- Attacker rolls attack skill
     +/– modifiers.
- Melee: Defender rolls
     Fray or melee combat
     skill +/– modifiers.
- Ranged: Defender rolls
     (Fray skill ÷ 2, round
     down) +/– modifiers.
- If attacker succeeds and
     rolls higher than the
     target, the attack hits.
- Critical hits are armor-
     defeating.
- An Excellent Success
     increases the damage
     by +5 (MoS 30+) or
     +10 (MoS 60+).
- Armor is reduced by
     the attack's Armor
     Penetration value (AP).
- The weapon's damage is
     reduced by the target's
     modified Armor rating
     (unless the attack is
     armor-defeating).
- If damage exceeds
     Wound Threshold, a
     wound is also scored.
     (Multiple wounds
     apply if the damage
     exceeds Wound
     Threshold by multiple
     factors.)
