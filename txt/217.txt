    Every time you succeed in a Willpower Test to avoid
 taking stress from a particular source, take note. If you
 successfully resist such a situation 5 times, you become
 effectively immune to taking stress from that source.
    The drawback to hardening yourself to such situa-
 tions is that you grow detached and callous. In order
 to protect yourself, you have learned to cut off your
 emotions—but it is such emotions that make you
 human. You have erected mental walls that will affect
 your empathy and ability to relate to others.
    Each time you harden yourself to one source of
 stress, your maximum Moxie stat is reduced by 1.
 Psychotherapy may be used to overcome such harden-
 ing, in the same way a disorder is treated.

 MENTAL HEALING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
 Stress is trickier to heal than physical damage. There
 are no nano-treatments or quick fix options (other
 than killing yourself and reverting to a non-stressed
 backup). The options for recuperating are simply natu-
 ral healing over time, psychotherapy, or psychosurgery.
                PSYCHOTHERAPY CARE
                Characters with an appropriate skill—
                Medicine: Psychiatry, Academics: Psychol-
und down)        ogy, or Professional: Psychotherapy—can
                 assist a character suffering mental stress
und down)
                 or trauma with psychotherapy. This treat-
und down)
                 ment is a long-term process, involving
und down)        methods such as psychoanalysis, counsel-
und down)        ing, roleplaying, relationship-building,
0                hypnotherapy, behavioral modification,
0                drugs, medical treatments, and even psy-
0                chosurgery (p. 229). AIs skilled in psycho-
und down)        therapy are also available.
                    Psychotherapy is a task action, with a
+2
                 timeframe of 1 hour per point of stress,
+5              8 hours per trauma, and 40 hours per
0                disorder. Note that this only counts the
+2               time actually spent in psychotherapy with
+3               a skilled professional. After each psycho-
+5               therapy session, make a test to see if the
und down)        session was successful. Successful psycho-
                 surgery adds a +30 modifier to this test; at
0
                 the gamemaster's discretion, other modi-
+3
                 fiers may apply. Likewise, each disorder
und down)        the character holds inflicts a –10 modifier.
und down)       Traumas may not be healed until all stress
0                is eliminated.
+3                  When a trauma is healed, the derange-
 p. 366          ment associated with that trauma is
+2               eliminated or downgraded. Disorders are
                 treated separately from the trauma that
                 caused them, and may only be treated
                when all other traumas are removed.
      Gamemaster and players are encouraged to roleplay
    a character's suffering and relief from traumas and
    disorders. Each is an experience that makes a profound
    impact on a character's personality and psyche. The
    process of treatment may also change them, so in the
    end they may be a transformed from the person they
    once were. Even if treated, the scars are likely to remain
    for some time to come. According to some opinions,
    disorders are never truly eradicated, they are just eased
    into submission ... where they may linger beneath the
    surface, waiting for some trauma to come along.

   NATURAL HEALING
   Characters who eschew psychotherapy can hopefully
   work out the problems in their head on their own over
   time. For every month that passes without accruing
   new stress, the character may make a WIL x 3 Test. If
   successful, they heal 1d10 points of stress or 1 trauma
   (all stress must be healed first). Disorders are even more
   difficult to heal, requiring 3 months without stress or
   trauma, and even then only being eliminated with a
   successful WIL Test. As a result, disorders can linger
   for years until resolved with actual psychotherapy.
