who are actively observing (even if they are concealing
their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a
tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.

PENETRATION
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Quick
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Instant
     STRAIN MOD: 1 per AP point SKILL:  Psi Assault
Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with
any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill.
It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an op-
ponent by concentrating their psi attack. Every point
of Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts
1 point of strain. The maximum AP that may be ap-
plied equals the async's Psi Assault skill divided by 10
(round down).

PSI SHIELD
    PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
    RANGE:      Self         DURATION: Constant
Psi Shield bolsters the async's mind to psi attack and
manipulation. If the async is hit by a psi attack, they
receive WIL ÷ 5 (round up) points of armor, reducing
the amount of damage inflicted. They also receive a
+10 modifier when resisting any other sleights.

PSYCHIC STAB
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Instant
    STRAIN MOD: +0           SKILL:    Psi Assault
Psychic Stab is an offensive sleight that seeks to inflict
physical damage on the target's brain and nervous
system. Each successful attack inflicts 1d10 + (WIL ÷
10, round up) damage. Increase the damage by +5 if
an Excellent Success is scored.

SCRAMBLE
    PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
   RANGE:      Self       DURATION: Constant
Scramble allows the async using the sleight to hide
from another async using the Ego Sense or Omni
Awareness sleights. Apply a +30 modifier to the de-
fending async's Opposed Test.

SENSE BLOCK
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: –1            SKILL:   Psi Assault
Sense Block disables and short circuits one of the tar-
get's sensory cortices (chosen by the async), interfering
with and possibly negating a specific source of sensory
input for the chosen duration. If the async beats the
target in the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –30
modifier to Perception Tests with that sense equal (dou-
bled to –60 if the async scores an Excellent Success).
SPAM
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

     STRAIN MOD: +0            SKILL:    Psi Assault
The sleight allows the async to overload and flood one
of the target's sensory cortices (chosen by the async),
 spamming them with confusing and distracting sen-
 sory input and thereby impairing them. If the async
wins the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –10 modi-
fier to all tests the duration of the sleight (doubled to
–20 if the async scores an Excellent Success).

STATIC
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Close        DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: +0           SKILL:    None
The async generates an anti-psi jamming field, imped-
ing any use of ranged sleights within their range. All
such ranged sleights suffer a –30 modifier. This sleight
has no effect on self or touch-range sleights.

SUBLIMINAL
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION:   Instant
    STRAIN MOD: +2           SKILL:    Control
The Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence
the train of thought of another person by implement-
ing a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind
of the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the
recipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was
their own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short
and simple; as a rule of thumb, the gamemaster may
only suggestions encompassed by a short sentence
(for example: “open the airlock,” or “hand over the
weapon”). At the gamemaster's discretion, the target
may receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are
immediately life threatening (“jump off the bridge”)
or that violate their motivations or personal strictures.
Suggestions do not need to be carried out immediately,
they may be implanted with a short trigger condition
(“when the alarm goes off, ignore it”).

THOUGHT BROWSE
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: –1          SKILL:   Sense
Thought Browse is a less-intrusive form of mind
reading which scans the target's surface thoughts for
certain “keywords” like a particular word, phrase,
sound, or image chosen by the async. Rather than dig-
ging through the target's ego as with the Deep Scan
sleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a
target has a particular person, place, event, or thing
in mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to
draw conclusions without the need to invade the mind
