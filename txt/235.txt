           Per request, I have compiled a review of the        tr
           Futura Project and its fallout, 5 years after       a
           whistleblowers and intense media attention          ti
           forced us to end the project and release the        e
           remaining subjects (dubbed “the Lost” by            2
           popular media).                                     4
               Futura was a joint initiative spearheaded by    d
           Hanto Genomics and strongly backed by Cog-          ch
           nite, with numerous other partners (complete        3
           list). The project was initially proposed by my
           mentor, Dr. Antonio Pascal, whose team had          re
           proven the feasibility of Accelerated Life Ex-      ca
           perience Training (ALET) after a series of pilot    so
           studies with two small (N<1000) samples.            a
           While it is true that these early pilot studies     e
           used both older subjects and a lesser amount        fa
           of time dilation, the rationale for the Futura      th
           Project's ambitious program was justified by a       su
           remarked decrease in transhumanity's popula-        a
           tion due to the Fall, a system-wide stagnant        o
           population growth rate (blamed on various           m
           factors including increased longevity, available    n
           contraception, and rising despair over troubling    Pa
           times), as well as a desire to move aggressively    ti
           into a new technological sector in the hopes of     b
           obtaining a competitive advantage.                  e
               Futura began immediately in the wake            m
           of the Fall with an initial seed population
           of       test subjects culled from extant genetic   th
           material and gestated to between 1 week and         o
           6 months after birth. Of these, less than 10%       m
           were live births from either a surrogate or         to
           genetic birth mother who had perished during        ti
           the Fall. The majority came from our Lunar and      w
