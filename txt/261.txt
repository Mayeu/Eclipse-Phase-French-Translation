SUBVERSION
Once an intruder has successfully invaded a device
or network, they can pursue whatever tasks they are
interested in, as fitting that particular system. Depend-
ing on the type of account the intruder hacked, they
may or may not have access privileges to do what
they want to do. If their access rights allow it, the
activity is handled like that of a legitimate user and
no test is called for (unless the activity itself calls for
some kind of test, such as Research). For example, a
hacker who infiltrates a habitat’s security system with
a security account can monitor cameras, deactivate
sensors, review recorded surveillance footage, and so
on, as any legitimate user with security right would be
allowed to do.
   Engaging in any sort of activity for which you
don’t have access rights is more difficult and requires
hacking the system. This typically requires an Infosec
Success Test, modified by the difficulty of the action
as noted on the Subversion Difficulties table. In most
cases this in not an Opposed Test even if the system is
actively monitored, unless specifically stated otherwise.
Failing such tests, however, will result in a change of
the hacker’s intruder status (see Failing Tests, p. 256).
   Examples for different types of system subversion
are given in the Subversion Examples sidebar. This
is not an exhaustive list, however, and gamemasters
and players are encouraged to improvise game effects
in case an action has not been explicitly described.

AUGMENTED REALITY ILLUSIONS
A hacker who has infiltrated an ecto, mesh inserts, or
some other device with an AR interface may inject
different kinds of visual, auditory, tactile, and even
emotional illusions into the augmented reality of
the device’s user, depending on the type of interface
used. How the hacked user will respond to the illu-
sion depends on a number of factors, such as whether
they are aware of the intruder (i.e., the hacker has
Spotted or Locked status), what type of interface they
are using (entoptic or haptic), and how realistic the
illusion is.
   The best illusions are, of course, crafted in advance,
using the best image and sensory manipulation tools
available. Such illusions are hyper-realistic. Anyone
making a Perception Test to identify them as fake
