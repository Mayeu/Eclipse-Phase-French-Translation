RESLEEVING AND THE GAMEMASTER
The gamemaster has a fine amount of control over what a character can obtain when resleeving. The
characters may be supplied with new morphs by Firewall or whatever employer/patron for whom they are
currently working. In this case, the gamemaster can simply assign whatever morphs they see fit—with com-
plete control over enhancements, traits, etc. While morphs should be tailored for the mission at hand, this
presents an opportunity for the gamemaster to throw the characters some new toys to play with and also
some new challenges to overcome. Gamemasters are encouraged to mix it up, have fun, and give players
something they can work with without necessarily giving them everything they want.
   In other cases, the availability of desired morphs may be limited by the resleeving location. A small
outpost in the wilds of Mars is unlikely to have a wide selection of morphs—in fact, a few rusters and
synthmorphs may be all they have. Similarly, large habitats have a high demand for good morphs, so there
may be a waiting list for top-of-the-line sylphs or remade morphs, for example. In the same vein, available
morphs are going to be subject to local legalities, so getting that reaper morph may be out of the question.
Characters could always turn to black market morph providers, but these come with their own risks.
  What this means is that gamemasters should never be afraid to say no if a character is pursuing a morph
that is unreasonable or potentially disruptive to the game. While it's good form to give the players what they
want once in a while, it also makes for more interesting roleplaying to saddle them with morphs that are
a little different than what they were hoping for or that come with some interesting challenges, such as a
physical addiction. For extra fun, leave the character unaware of a morph's negative traits or secret implants
until they reveal themselves. As always, the goal is to have fun, but variety often helps with that.        ■
