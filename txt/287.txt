TIME
Once the raw materials and blueprints are in, most n
tion is simply a matter of time. The exact timeframe t
object varies, but roughly approximates 1 hour per cost
the item (1 hour for Trivial, 2 for Low, 3 for Moderate

THE PROGRAMMING TEST
Nanofabrication is typically handled as a Programming
rication Test. In most cases, this can be treated as a Sim
Test (p. 118), with a failed roll simply indicating that th

   In some cases, the gamemaster may call for an actual S
meaning that failure is more of a possibility. This shou
done for items that are exotic, extremely complicated, o
the blueprints are incomplete or otherwise suspect. This t
be made if the raw materials are limited.

AIs have a Programming: Nanofabrication skill of 30 (s
