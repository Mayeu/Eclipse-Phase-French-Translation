ARMOR
Modern personal armor systems have advanced from
the high modulus polyethylene thermoplastics and
aramid fabrics of the early 21st century. Armor in
Eclipse Phase is derived from biotech, in the form of
organoweave fibers and crystalline-grown plates, and
nanotech, in the form of shock-absorbing fullerene (p.
298) materials. Occasionally other materials are used,
such as metallic glass plates or shear-resistant fluids
that harden against impacts. Such armor protects
against (armor-piercing) bullets and kinetic impacts
as well as bladed weapons and piercing sharp objects.
They also insulate against both the explosive heating
of energy weapons and electrical shocks. While such
armor protects against bullets, the layers of mate-
rial catch the bullet and redistribute its kinetic energy
across the body, which can still result in severe blunt
force trauma.
   Rules for armor in combat can be found on p. 194.
Armored exoskeletons are listed on p. 343.
   Armor Clothing: The extra-resilient organoweave
fibers and fullerene materials that offer basic protec-
tion against kinetic and energy weapons can be woven
in with normal smart materials to create a wide range
of discreet armor clothing that provides a subtle level
of security. Such protective garments are indistin-
guishable from regular clothing and come in all styles
and designs. Armor clothing provides an Armor Value
of 3/4. [Trivial]
   Armor Vest: Armor vests provide more thorough
protection to a body's vital areas, covering the abdo-
men and torso completely, protecting the neck with a
rigid collar, and even providing wrap-under protec-
tion for the groin. Though armor vests are not bulky,
they are obvious as armor. Armor vests may be worn
with armor clothing without penalty. Armor vests
provide an Armor Value of 6/6. [Low]
   Body Armor (Light): These high performance armor
outfits protect the wearer from head to toe. An inte-
grated armor vest is supplemented with increased pro-
tection on the limbs and joints, while still managing to
be flexible and non-restrictive. Body armor is typically
worn by security and police forces, and supplemented
with a helmet. It provides an Armor Value of 10/10.
[Low]
   Body Armor (Heavy): Similar to light body armor,
but with extra protective layers, often ergonomically
manufactured to conform to a specific character's
body, and an environmental seal with climate control
to protect the wearer from hostile environments. It
provides an Armor Value of 13/13. [Moderate]
   Crash Suit: Designed for both industrial worksite
safety and protection from accidental zero-G collisions,
crash suits are also favored by sports enthusiasts and
explorers. The basic jumpsuit offers comfortable pro-
tection equal to that of armor clothing. When activat-
ed with an electronic signal, however, elastic polymers
within the suit stiffen and form rigid impact protection
for vital areas. Crash suits provide an Armor Value of
3/4 when inactive and 4/6 when activated. [Low]
   Helmet: This armor accessory is usually worn with
body armor or a battle suit. Light helmets are open,
whereas full helmets latch on and provide an environ-
mental seal with a 12 hour supply of air. Light helmets
provide an Armor Value bonus of +2/+2, whereas full
helmets add +3/+3. Helmets are often equipped with
an ecto (p. 325), a radio booster (p. 313), and sensors
equal to specs (see p. 325). [Trivial]
   Riot Shield: Used for mob suppression, riots shields
are light-weight, tough, and may be set to electrify on
command, stunning anyone who comes into contact
with the outer surface (treat as shock glove effects, p.
334). Riot shields provide an Armor Value bonus of
+3/+2. [Low]
   Second Skin: This lightweight bodysuit, woven
from spider silks and fullerenes, is typically worn
as an underlayer, though some athletes use it as a
uniform. It provides minimal protection, but may be
worn with other armor without penalty. It provides an
Armor Value of 1/3. [Low]
   Smart Skin: Smart skin is an advanced nano-
fluid that covers the wearer's skin. It resembles liquid
mercury but retains the texture and flexibility of
normal skin until activated, at which point the mate-
rial becomes rigid enough to protect the wearer and
