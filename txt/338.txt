BRAND NAME WEAPONS
AND COMBINED ARMS
The weapons listed in this book define generic
samples of each weapon. Gamemasters are en-
couraged to offer brand name versions of each
weapon, each with its particular idiosyncrasies
and small variations. For example, a Direct
Action A30 SMG might lack a semi-automatic
setting but come equipped with an extra ammo
capacity of 35. Likewise, a Medusan Arms Longi-
nus sniper rifle may inflict an extra +2 damage
but have an AP of only –12.
  Similarly, many of the weapons listed here are
available as combined arms weapons systems. A
police-issue assault rifle may also feature a stun-
ner—all built into the same weapon. For com-
bined arms, simply add together the individual
weapon component costs.                         ■



   Machine Gun: Machine guns are heavy weapons,
 typically mounted, and intended to provide continu-
 ous fire for support or suppressive purposes. They fire
 in burst fire or full auto modes, and are two-handed
 weapons. [High]

 RAILGUNS
 Railguns use a pair of electromagnetic rails to slide
 and accelerate a non-explosive conductive projectile at
 extremely high velocities (Mach 6+) to create an over-
 whelming, penetrating attack. The kinetic energy of

     the projectile exceeds that of an explosive-filled shell
     of greater mass and creates shock and heat waves
     upon impact that shatter and incinerate the target, or
     portions of it. While railguns are more potent than
     firearms, the ammunition choices are limited as the
     projectile must be conductive and able to survive
     both acceleration and heat created in the process due
     to friction. Nanofabrication allows railguns to be
     manufactured on the personal weapons scale while
     high-energy portable batteries provide the power to
     fire them. Railgun operation is silent except for the
     supersonic crack of the projectile.
        Railguns are available in the same models as fire-
     arms (pistols through machine guns), with the follow-
     ing modifications:

      - Increase AP by –3
      - Increase damage by +2
      - Increase the maximum for each range category
        by x1.5
      - Increase Cost category by one
      - Railguns may only use regular and armor-pierc-
        ing ammunition
      - Railguns also require battery power for each shot.
        Standard railgun batteries hold enough power for
        200 shots, after which they must be recharged at
        the rate of 20 points per hour.

     KINETIC AMMUNITION
     Ammunition is defined by its various types (standard,
     gel, APDS, etc.) and by the class of gun (light pistol,
     heavy pistol, SMG, etc.). For simplicity, each gun
     can trade ammunition with another gun of its class,
     though ammunition for firearms and railguns is not
