 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with
 any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target
 is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses
 their next action. A critical failure means the target
 is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per
 10 points of MoF. In this stun setting, the pulser fires
 only in single-shot mode.
    Microwave Agonizer: The agonizer fires millimeter-
 wave beams that create an unpleasant burning sen-
 sation in skin (even through armor) and to metals.
 Agonizers have two settings. The first is an active
 denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the
 target, inflicting –20 to the target’s actions and forc-
 ing them to move away from the beam on their next
 action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with
 Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer
 a –10 modifier and roll WIL x 2). Synthetic morphs
 and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the
 equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second
 setting (colloquially known as the “roast” setting) has
 the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the
 target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally devel-
 oped for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for
 repelling animals. The agonizer is small-sized (p. 297)
 and fires in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]
    Particle Beam Bolter: This weapon shoots a bolt of
 accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer
 massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, su-
 perheating and creating an explosion when striking.
 The bolter’s beam is not diffused by the cloud that
 occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetra-
 tion than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not
 affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter’s beam is
 invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either
 atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation,
 and will not function in the opposite environment
 (though bulkier dual models, combining both models,
 are also available). Bolters fire in semi-auto mode and
 are rifle-sized two-handed weapons. [High]
    Plasma Rifle: This bulky, heavy, two-handed
 weapon blasts a stream of nova-hot plasma at the
 target, inflicting severe burns and thermal damage,
 possibly melting or evaporating the target entirely.
 Plasma rifles are perhaps the deadliest man-portable
 weapons in use. Plasma guns suffer from dangerous

    Turn of cool-down time after every 2 shots. Plasma
    rifles only fire in single shot mode. [Expensive]
       Stunner: The stunner is an electrolaser that cre-
    ates an electrically-conductive plasma channel to the
    target, down which it transmits a powerful electric
    current, shocking the target. Stunners do not work in
    vacuum. Stunners fire in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]

    SEEKERS
    Seekers are a combination of automatic grenade
    launcher, micromissile, coilgun, and smart munitions
    technology. Unlike traditional launchers of the past,
    miniaturization allows the manufacture of seeker mi-
    cromissile launchers in personal weapon sizes. Seeker
    rounds are fired at high-velocity via rings of magnetic
    coils, after which the micromissile or minimissile uses
    scramjet technology to propel itself and maintain high
    velocities over great distances. Seekers are wielded
    using Seeker Weapon skill.
       Seeker missiles are detailed on p. 340. Like gre-
    nades, seekers may be programmed for a variety of
    trigger events (see Grenades and Seekers, p. 199). All
    seeker weapons are smartlink-equipped (p. 342).

       Seeker Armband (Micromissile): This weapons unit
    is worn on the arm, allowing the user to point and
    fire using an entoptic smartlink system. Though highly
    portable, the armband’s micromissile supply is low. It
    fires in single-shot mode. [Moderate]
       Seeker Pistol (Micromissile): This pistol-sized
    seeker launcher fires micromissiles in semi-auto
    mode. [Moderate]
