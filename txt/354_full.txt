 SPOILER ALERT
 If you're a player and not a gamemaster, we strongly recommend you skip this chapter, as it presents
 secrets and other information that can ruin your enjoyment of the game. No, really, stop reading, we mean
 it. Ok, maybe you're obsessive and you want to know everything about the game—you did buy this book
 after all. But really, do you read the last chapter of a book first, so you know how it ends? Do you ask for
 the punchline before hearing the joke? Do you wait for a movie to come out and read the reviews with
 full spoilers before you go see it? Ok, maybe you do, and in that case, be our guest, read away. Just keep
 in mind that some of the things here may change your perspective during game play. A good roleplayer
 can swing that, though, and maybe you're a control freak info-junkie that prefers to know it all. Hrm, in
 retrospect, so we are we, so we can respect that. Keep in mind, however, that by reading this chapter, you
 are now able—and some may say obligated—to run the game for your friends who do happen to listen to
 spoiler alerts.                                                                                          ■
