JELLIES (BIOMORPH)
These exsurgents resemble collections of massive, slimy,
mucus-filled bubbles. Their soft, amorphous shape
allows jellies to squeeze, slide, and slither through
even tiny spaces. Jellies are equipped with a number
of “limbs” that resemble long meaty tongues studded
with hard fleshy spikes that provide excellent gripping
ability. The lubricating coating that envelopes jellies is
both toxic and slightly corrosive, melting plastics and
biological materials after a half hour of exposure. This
substance may also be “spit” at targets.

  jellies suffer the minimum amount of damage from
  standard kinetic weapon and blade attacks.

SHIFTERS (SYNTHMORPH)
Shifters are synthmorphs whose material frames have
been converted to an exotic smart matter liquid metal.
This shapeshifting material can stabilize as a hardened
metallic shell or liquefy and reshape itself into other
forms. This allows the shifter to reflow its shell in a
matter of seconds, enabling it to visually mimic other
forms, including biomorphs (though they are easily
detectable as synthmorphs at other wavelengths or by
touch). Shifters may also reshape parts of their shell
into melee weapons such as knives or clubs.

SNAPPERS (SYNTHMORPHS)
Snapper exsurgents are typically crafted from vehicles
or other large synthetic shells or by melding multiple
synthmorphs together. They take the form of an in-
sectoid multi-segmented hexagonal tube with multiple
sets of limbs, three apiece, set radially 120 degrees
around the torso. These limbs are heavy, double-
jointed, and articulated with three joints. Each limb
ends in either a triad of manipulatory digits or a larger
pincer-like claw.

WHIPPERS (BIOMORPH)
These small barrel-shaped creatures have a mass
of small legs under their trunk that allows for fast
movement. At the top of their trunk is another mass
of 3-meter long, strong, whip-like tentacles. Some
of these tentacles feature gripping surfaces for grab-
bing and holding (both for tool use and mobility),
while others are sharp-edged and useful for slicing
through opponents.

WRAPPERS (BIOMORPH)
These exsurgents resemble large, thin, four-armed,
spiny starfish, capable of walking in a quadruped
manner, though they are seemingly better adapted for
microgravity. A large circular mouth resides in their
middle on one side and each arm ends in small sharp-
clawed digits, useful for climbing and tool use. Small
vent sacs allow for thrusting in microgravity and
sensory bands on the upper part of each arm provide
low-frequency hearing and infrared-equivalent sens-
ing. Their name comes from their tendency to drop on
opponents from above, wrapping themselves around
the head and arms.
