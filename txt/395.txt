                       COUNTERMEASURES
 Passive Alert (-10 modiﬁer to intruders)
 Locate Intruder: Opposed Infosec Test; if successful, intruder becomes Lock
 Re-authenticate Users: Next Action Turn, intruder must make Infosec Test
   log in again
 Reduce Privileges: Limit user access privileges; see p. 246
 Active Alert (-20 modiﬁer to intruders)
 Counterintrusion: If Trace (see below) is successful, launch intrusion attem
   on intruder's home system
 Lockout: Opposed Infosec Test; if successful, intruder dumped from system.
 Reboot/Shutdown: Takes 1 Action Turn to 1 minute (GM discretion); all use
   ejected from system.
 Trace: Trace intruder to home system with a Research Test (-30 if in privacy m
 Wireless Termination: At end of Action Turn, all wireless connections term
   nated; wireless users ejected.
