    “What’s the number?”
                                           LACK
       The words dig their claws into my new vocal cords and yank themselves up and out of my parched throat.
     My diction is predictably poor, as it always is during the first few minutes following a resleeve. The pitch
     of the voice is apparent despite the mumbled, sandpaper slur of the words. Definitely a biomorph and my
     latest sex is female. This much I know in the first few seconds. The model eludes me right now, but I’ll know
     for certain soon enough, once motion is mine again. Another fury morph is my first guess.
        The slab is hard. Nothing more than frigid metal with crisp white synth-slick wrapped around it. Typical
      accommodations for a corp dollhouse. The chill seeps through my skin and wraps around my bones.
        A cortical cruncher looms over me, waving his welcome-back beam side to side, occasionally catching my
      pupils. His smug, bored face speaks: “Consciousness confirmed.” The beam clicks off. My question should
      have made it obvious that I am back, but the guy is a slave to procedure. They all are. Corporate body
      banks like their employees paralyzed by obedience, unable to think for themselves. I mumble the question
       again. “What’s the number?”
         “March 11.”
         “How many after the Fall?”
         “Are you for real?”

          I am paranoid. Yes. I need to know the year every time I return upon a body

         bank slab. Paranoia is just one of the plagues transhumanity faces these days.

           I try to snag the data from my new sleeve’s mesh inserts before opening my mouth again. No luck. Asking
        a sleeve tech for the year is always humiliating. Makes me feel like an amateur, but the circumstances are
        definitely extenuating, so I press him. Hard.
           “Answer the fucking question.”
            The corp sloth gives me the lunatic eye before he answers.
           “Uh ... 10 AF. You haven’t been gone that long. Your last backup ... “
            He scans his entoptics for the info.
           “ ... 14 days, 7 hours ago.”
             It takes a second to sink in, but when it does, it stings. It never ceases to shock when time slips away from
          me. Two weeks. Gone. Completely wiped from my existence. Two weeks ago, there was another me, sleeved
          in another morph. There was a mission and it led to my death. That is all I know. Either Firewall failed
          to retrieve the cortical stack off the corpse so I could retain those two weeks, or the fuckers deliberately
          chose to swipe that time from me. Honestly, though, both possibilities are preferable to having another self
           bouncing around out there, doing who knows what-the-fuck. Some t-humies get off on having multiple
           selves traipsing all over, but my ego is in check. One Sava is enough misery to unleash on the ‘verse.
               Shit. My brain is wandering off into morose territory; always does during the first moments following a
           resleeve. I need a physical context. Something tangible to focus my attention on. I bring my hands in front
            of my eyes, arms feeling like two-ton sacks of rocks. The fingers are thin and long; the knuckles callused,
            scarred and misshapen. Obviously the work of many thrown punches, fists connecting with jaws, metal,
            flesh. Yep. A well-worn fury morph. You get what you pay for, I suppose; or what Firewall is willing to pay
            for. Why do I do it? As far as the org is concerned, I’m nothing more than a cheap precision instrument,
             tossed into the recycling bin when I snap in half. There will always be more of me, until the horrors prove
             too intense, until the files get too corrupt, until I know too much and Firewall decides to wipe me, then
             some other sap will step in to preserve transhumanity. Preserve transhumanity. Fantastic. Now I’m babbling
              like a Firewall propaganda tweet! My arms weaken and flop back to my sides. The strength just isn’t there
              yet. A few more minutes with nothing but my thoughts.
                 On his way out of the recovery bay, the cort cruncher laughs at my feeble attempt at motion. “What’s
               your hurry?” he says. “Just relax, willya? You collapse onto the floor, you’re gonna stay there until you get
               yourself up. They don’t pay me enough to babysit newbies.” His flippancy doesn’t help my mood and the
               melancholy returns.
                  What experiences are no longer a part of my consciousness? Perhaps the thrill of a lifetime. Did I discover
                true beauty? Fall in love? Have an epiphany? Save a life? I’ll never know. Those memories, that life, that
                version of me, is gone. The new me, lying on this slab, was never shaped by those experiences. My chest
                hollows out from the weight of the loss.

No one knew the true capabilities of the TITANs to intercept and decode, so the courier had been
injected with nanobots that etched a nanoscopic encoded message directly onto one of his femur
bones. However, he had never made it off the planet. His message had never been delivered.
    Pivo and Sava had no idea what the information was, but someone at Firewall obviously
 deemed it worthy of capture. Information on the TITANs perhaps. Or some CEO’s secret
 family recipe for pasta sauce.
    [This is the one.] Pivo held out the femur to Sava and tossed the others to the floor.
    [What does it say?]
     [I don’t know. Not sure I want to know.] Pivo continued to hold out the femur.
     [Enough with the drama Pivo. Just get your nanos to read it. We need a copy of the data. If you don’t want to
  carry, I will.]
      [I’d prefer that. Thank you.] Pivo set his nanobots to work on deciphering the inscription. When they
  were done, the intel was transmitted directly to Sava. Pivo wanted no part of it.
      [So, now what? How do we get out of here? The only way out is the way we came in, and that’s suicide.]
   Pivo’s complexion changed from a milky green to an almost royal blue. It always happened when
   helplessness began to settle in.
       Sava did not hesitate to answer, choosing to speak as opposed to transmit. “We’re not gonna
   leave, Pivo. Not even gonna try.” Sava raised the plasma rifle and aimed it directly at Pivo’s oblong
   head. “See you next time, calamari.” Sava pulled the trigger, and a fiery bolt of plasma reduced
    Pivo to a twitching mass of bloody scorched cartilage atop writhing arms. The arms continued to
    flop on the floor in a growing pool of blood as Sava sat down next to a pile of bones and leaned
    against the wall.

         Upon exhale, Careza pinged. [Shall I contact Project Ozma?]
         Yeah. Get our lady on the line.

     Careza. [Are you prepared to deliver, Agent Sava?]
          [That depends.] Sava took another drag.
          [Perhaps I did not make myself clear during our initial negotiations, Agent Sava. Your
      options are rather limited. You are unlikely to make it off the planet alive, and we cannot
       afford to lose this information, nor can we afford to have it fall into the hands of your
       organization. You are going to have to follow through, and trust that we will do the same.]

           [Either you give me her location right now, or I take your precious info with me.]
           There was a long pause before the woman transmitted again. [You realize there will be conse-
        quences, Agent Sava. For you and for Rati.]
           [Yeah. I suppose so.] The cigarette burned to the filter and Sava flicked it into a bone pile. [So what’s
        it gonna be?]
            [We do not bargain, Agent Sava, after a deal has been struck. Do as you will, and we will react
         accordingly.] The connection with the woman terminated. Sava stood up and walked over to where
         the courier’s femur lay and picked it up. Pivo’s gore coated the bone. Sava wiped it off and held it
         up to take a close look.
             Sorry, Careza. Info payload only. Leave the ego behind.
             [Understood.]
             With the flash of a thought, Sava instructed Careza to activate the cortical stack’s emergency
          farcaster—a one-shot neutrino transmitter, powered by the tiniest amount of antimatter. Sava’s
          head exploded all over the room, taking the courier’s femur with it. The information contained on
          the femur, however, found its way almost instantly through the blackest depths of space, landing

                                      To play a game of Eclipse Phase, you need the following:

                                       • A group of players and a place to meet (real life
                                         or online!)
                                       • One player to act as the gamemaster
                                       • The contents of this book
                                       • Something for everyone to take notes with (note-
                                         pads, laptops, whatever!)
                                       • Two 10-sided dice per player (or a digital
                                         equivalent)
                                       • Imagination

                                      A GROUP OF PLAYERS AND A PLACE TO MEET
                                      While roleplaying games are flexible enough to allow
                                      any number of people, most gaming groups number
                                      around four to eight players. That number of people
                                      brings a good mix of personalities to the table and
                                      ensures great cooperative play.
                                         Once a group of players have determined to play
                                      Eclipse Phase, they’ll need to designate someone as
                                      the gamemaster (see below). Then they’ll need to de-
                                      termine a time and place to meet.
                                         Most roleplaying groups meet once a week at a reg-
                                      ularly scheduled time and place: 7:00 PM, Thursday
                                      night, Rob’s house, for example. However, each group
                                      determines where, how they’ll play, and how often.
                                      One group may decide they can only get together
                                      once a month, while another group is so excited to

LOST LORE
The accumulated knowledge and media of Earth,
spanning the history of human intelligence, is a
vast and impressive amount. Even before the Fall,
many orbital settlements had acquired complete
records of all previous human lore and creativity,
including copies of every book, painting, song,
ﬁlm, TV program, console game, newspaper, and
magazine article that had ever been translated
into digital format, as well as backups of Earth’s
entire internet archives. Numerous destructive
programs unleashed during the Fall corrupted
much of this information, however, in some cases
permanently wiping it from existence.
  This means that what remains of Earth’s
archived history and data is patchy and incom-
plete. Much survives, but some treasures have
been lost. In particular, media from the era of the
Fall itself is particularly hard to come by, given
the consistent attacks the TITANs were making on
information systems. Proprietary data that was
withheld from the public domain behind elec-
tronic gates on Earth is even more likely to have
been lost, except for a few hypercorps that man-
aged to transfer their Earth-bound data off-world
in time.
  Retrieving lost data is a lucrative task for scav-
engers and archeologists, though looting the
dangerous conﬁnes of Earth or derelict habitats
destroyed during the Fall is a risky proposition. ■




  ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA
  A substantial amount of media survives the Fall of
  Earth, and a significant number of modern transhu-
  mans make their living creating new songs, stories,
  reports, or other media. All of this is easily and swiftly
  accessible through any basic implant, ecto, or (on very
  rare occasions) archaic handheld terminal. However,
  most of this media is not to the taste of any particular

  a result, most humans keep two layers of evaluation
  between them and anything they might consider ex-
  posing themselves to.
    The first layer is based on popularity and critical re-
  views. Every piece of media has a rating, often weight-
  ed by the opinions of critics with high rep scores who
  comment on their virtues and faults. Specialized AIs

                                      In every game, there comes a time when the gamemas-
                                      ter must decide if a character succeeds or fails in an
                                      action. This is when the players roll dice and the char-
                                      acters’ stats and abilities come into play. This chapter
                                      defines the core mechanics and rules that govern the
                                      outcomes of events in Eclipse Phase.

                                      THE ULTIMATE RULE
                                      One rule in Eclipse Phase outweighs all of the others:

                                      rule, change it. If you can’t find a rule, make one up.
                                      If you disagree over a rule’s interpretation, flip a coin.
                                      Try not to let rules interfere with the game’s flow and

TEAMWORK
If two or more characters join forces to tackle a test
together, one of the characters must be chosen as the
primary actor. This leading character will usually (but
not always) be the one with the highest applicable
skill. The primary acting character is the one who
rolls the test, though they receive a +10 modifier for
each additional character helping them out, up to a
maximum +30 modifier. Note that helping characters
do not necessarily need to know the skill being used
if the gamemaster decides that they can follow the
primary actor’s lead.

           Vic both sit down and help her out, giving her a
           +20 modiﬁer (+10 for each helper) to her Hard-
           ware: Robotics Test.




TYPES OF TESTS
There are two types of tests in Eclipse Phase: Success
and Opposed.

SUCCESS TESTS
Success Tests are called for whenever a character is
acting without direct opposition. They are the stan-
dard tests used to determine how well a character
exercises a particular skill or ability.
   Success Tests are handled exactly as described under
Making Tests, p. 115. The player rolls d100 against a
target number equal to the character’s skill +/– modi-
fiers. If they roll equal to or less than the target number,
the test succeeds, and the action is completed as desired.
If they roll higher than the target number, the test fails.

TRYING AGAIN
If you fail at a test, you can take another shot. Each
subsequent attempt at an action after a failure, how-
ever, incurs a cumulative –10 modifier. That means the
second try suffers –10, the third –20, the fourth –30,
and so on, up to the maximum –60.

TAKING THE TIME                                                GAME MECHANICS
Most skill tests are made for Automatic, Quick, or
Complex Actions (see pp. 119–120) and so are re-
solved within one Action Turn (3 seconds, see p. 119).
Tests made for Task actions (p. 120) take longer.
  Players may choose to take extra time when their
character undertakes an action, meaning that they
choose to be especially careful when performing the
action in order to enhance their chance of success. For
every minute of extra time they take, they increase
their target number by +10. Once they’ve modified
their target number to over 99, they are practically as-
sured of success, so the gamemaster can waive the dice
roll and grant them an automatic success. Note that
the maximum +60 modifier rule still applies, so if their

                                      PSI
                                      Psi is a rare and anomalous set of mental abilities that

BRINKER
You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of the
transhumanity and the various goings-on in the rest of the
system. Your particular grouping may have sought out self-
imposed isolation, to pursue their own interests, or they may
have been exiled for their unpopular beliefs. Or you may
simply be a loner who prefers the vast emptiness of space
to socializing with others. You might be a religious cultist, a
primitivist, a utopian, or something altogether uninterested
in transhumanity.

CRIMINAL
You are involved with the crime-oriented underworld. You
may work with one of the Sol system’s major criminal fac-
tions—triads, the Night Cartel, the ID Crew, Nine Lives, Pax
Familae—or one of the smaller, local operators with a big
stake in a specific habitat. You might be a vetted member-
for-life, a reluctant recruit, or just a freelancer looking for
the next gig.

EXTROPIAN
You are an anarchistic supporter of the free market and pri-
vate property. You oppose government and favor a system
where security and legal matters are handled by private com-
petitors. Whether you consider yourself an anarcho-capitalist
or a mutualist (a difference only other Extropians can figure
out), you occupy a middle-ground between the hypercorps
and autonomists, dealing with both and yet trusted by neither.

You hail from a habitat controlled by the hypercorps. You
might be a hypercapitalist entrepeneur, a hedonistic socialite,
or a lowly vacworker, but you accept that certain liberties
must be sacrificed for security and freedom.

BRUTE STRENGTH
Any test that involves simple brute strength can be
handled as an SOM x 3 Test. Use this when smashing
down a door, breaking an item in half, engaging in a
tug-of-war, or lifting and carrying a heavy item.

CATCHING THROWN OBJECTS
Use REF + (COO x 2) any time you need to catch a
thrown or dropped object, such as catching a baseball,
saving a priceless vase from shattering, or throwing
back a grenade (see p. 200).

COMPOSURE AND RESOLVE
Various game situations may frighten your character,
turn their stomach, horrify them, or rattle them to the
core of their being. Use WIL x 3 to determine if your
character can hold their ground, keep it down, and
pull themselves together.

ESCAPE ARTIST
If a character wants to slip free of physical bonds (such
as ropes or handcuffs) or otherwise contort themselves
(such as wriggling out from under a collapsed wall or
an overturned vehicle), an Escape Artist Test may be
called for using the character’s COO + SOM. Apply
modifiers appropriate to the difficulty of the situation.
At the gamemaster’s discretion, escaping from some
restraining situations may be considered a Task Action
with an appropriate timeframe.

HAVING AN IDEA
Sometimes the players miss the obvious, or their per-
sonal mindset or biases cause them to misinterpret a
situation or understand events in a way different from
how the actual character would. In cases like this, the
gamemaster can call for an INT x 3 or COG x 3 roll
(whichever is more appropriate) to determine if the
character gets an idea that will help them along. This
test should be used sparingly, and only for assessing
the character’s interpretation of obvious and known
facts and details.

MEMORIZING AND REMEMBERING
Memories are what egos use to maintain continuity of
self from morph to morph, but humans are notorious
for remembering things incorrectly. Whenever char-
                                                                             SKILLS
acters attempt to recall a memory or memorize some
piece of information, use COG x 3 to determine how
well they succeed. Note that characters with eidetic
memory (p. 146 or 301) or mnemonic augmentation
(p. 307) have perfect memory, so no test is required.

  USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
  At ﬁrst glance, it may seem that Knowledge skills have
  fewer in-game applications than Active skills. To some
  degree this is the case. The importance of Knowledge
  skills, however, should not be underestimated. While
  they play a role in analyzing clues and solving myster-
  ies, the real value of Knowledge skills is in helping the
  characters—and the players—understand the world of
  Eclipse Phase. In particular these skills can be used to
  make plans, assess a situation, identify strengths and
  weaknesses, evaluate worth, make comparisons, forecast
  probable outcomes, or understand the applicable science,
  socio-economic factors, or cultural or historical context.
     For example, a group of characters looking to break
  into a facility could use Profession: Security Procedures
  to evaluate the defenses, Academic: Architecture to
  identify covert points of entry, Interests: Sports to plan
  their inﬁltration at a time when the guards are likely to
  be distracted, Interests: Triads to identify a local crime
  group that can sell them breaking and entering gear,
  and Art: Sculpture when picking a valuable art piece
  with which to bribe an insider. When used appropriately,
  these skills can be just as beneﬁcial as the Active skills
  used to break inside, if not more so because the plan
  is more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation.
     It is largely up to the gamemaster to enforce how
  useful Knowledge skills are in their game. The easiest
  way to reinforce their relevance is to penalize charac-
  ters who don’t take advantage of them. For example,
  characters who didn’t use their Profession: Security
  Procedures in the example above might end up being
  surprised when they run across a security system they
  are not prepared to deal with, forcing them to impro-
  vise or even abandon their plans.                         ■

     COMBAT SUMMARY
    • Combat is handled as an
         Opposed Test.
    • Attacker rolls attack skill
         +/– modiﬁers.
    • Melee: Defender rolls
         Fray or melee combat
         skill +/– modiﬁers.
    • Ranged: Defender rolls
         (Fray skill ÷ 2, round
         down) +/– modiﬁers.
    • If attacker succeeds and
         rolls higher than the
         target, the attack hits.
    • Critical hits are armor-
         defeating.
    • An Excellent Success
         increases the damage
         by +5 (MoS 30+) or
         +10 (MoS 60+).
    • Armor is reduced by
         the attack’s Armor
         Penetration value (AP).
    • The weapon’s damage is
         reduced by the target’s
         modiﬁed Armor rating
         (unless the attack is
         armor-defeating).
    • If damage exceeds
         Wound Threshold, a
         wound is also scored.
         (Multiple wounds
         apply if the damage
         exceeds Wound

                                      DERANGEMENTS
                                      Derangements are temporary mental conditions that
                                      result from traumas. Derangements are measured as
                                      Minor, Moderate, or Major. The gamemaster and
                                      player should cooperate in choosing which derange-
                                      ment to apply, as appropriate to the scenario and
                                      character personality.
                                         Derangements last for 1d10 ÷ 2 hours (round
                                      down), or until the character receives psychiatric help,
                                      whichever comes first. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
                                      a derangement may last longer if the character has not
                                      been distanced from the source of the stress, or if they
                                      remain embroiled in other stress-inducing situations.
                                         Derangement effects are meant to be role-played.
                                      The player should incorporate the derangement into
                                      their character’s words and actions. If the gamemaster
                                      doesn’t feel the player is stressing the effects enough,
                                      they can emphasize them. If the gamemaster feels it is
                                      appropriate, they may also call for additional modi-
                                      fiers or tests for certain actions.

                                            HANDLING SEARCHES
                                            Online research is often a crucial element of Eclipse
                                            Phase scenarios, as characters take to the mesh to
                                            research backgrounds and uncover clues. The follow-
                                            ing suggestions present a method of handling research
                                            that does not rely solely on dice rolls and integrates it
                                            with the flow of the plot.
                                               First, common and inconsequential information
                                            should be immediately available without requiring
                                            a roll at all. Most characters rely on their muses to
                                            handle searches for them, passing on the results while
                                            the character focuses on other things.
                                               For searches that are more detailed, difficult, or
                                            central to the plot, a Research Test should be called

                                            An alternative to shutdown or rebooting is simply to
                                            sever all wireless connections by shutting down the
                                            wireless capabilities of the system. The system will
                                            lose all active connections, but any intruders will be
                                            dumped. Wireless termination is a Complex Action to
                                            initiate and completes at the end of that Action Turn.
                                            Re-starting wireless connectivity takes 1 Action Turn.

RESLEEVING AND THE GAMEMASTER
The gamemaster has a ﬁne amount of control over what a character can obtain when resleeving. The
characters may be supplied with new morphs by Firewall or whatever employer/patron for whom they are
currently working. In this case, the gamemaster can simply assign whatever morphs they see ﬁt—with com-
plete control over enhancements, traits, etc. While morphs should be tailored for the mission at hand, this
presents an opportunity for the gamemaster to throw the characters some new toys to play with and also
some new challenges to overcome. Gamemasters are encouraged to mix it up, have fun, and give players                                             ACCELERATED FUTURE
something they can work with without necessarily giving them everything they want.
   In other cases, the availability of desired morphs may be limited by the resleeving location. A small
outpost in the wilds of Mars is unlikely to have a wide selection of morphs—in fact, a few rusters and
synthmorphs may be all they have. Similarly, large habitats have a high demand for good morphs, so there
may be a waiting list for top-of-the-line sylphs or remade morphs, for example. In the same vein, available
                                                                                                                                                   10.10.1
                                                                                                                                               .10.
morphs are going to be subject to local legalities, so getting that reaper morph may be out of the question.
Characters could always turn to black market morph providers, but these come with their own risks.                                           0

  What this means is that gamemasters should never be afraid to say no if a character is pursuing a morph
                                                                                                                                0.10.10.10




that is unreasonable or potentially disruptive to the game. While it’s good form to give the players what they
want once in a while, it also makes for more interesting roleplaying to saddle them with morphs that are
a little different than what they were hoping for or that come with some interesting challenges, such as a
physical addiction. For extra fun, leave the character unaware of a morph’s negative traits or secret implants
until they reveal themselves. As always, the goal is to have fun, but variety often helps with that.        ■

   Clusters are most commonly found in volatile-rich environments
like the Trojans and the ring systems of the gas giants (particularly
Saturn). Clusters are rare in the Jovian system because shielding a
cluster of individual modules rather than one large station from
Jupiter’s intense magnetosphere is hideously inefficient.
   Cluster colonies can have anywhere from 50 to 250,000 inhabitants.

COLE BUBBLES
Cole bubbles (or “bubbleworlds”) are found mostly in the main
asteroid belt, where the large nickel-iron asteroids used to construct
them are abundant. Bubbleworlds are less common in the Trojans
and Greeks, where crusty ice asteroids predominate. A Cole bubble
is similar in many respects to an O’Neill cylinder, but there are no
longitudinal windows. Sunlight instead enters through axial mirror
arrays. The bubbleworld is also constructed very differently, using a
large solar array to heat a pocket of water inside of a metal asteroid
so that the metal expands. Rotating the asteroid causes the mal-
leable material to form a cylinder, which is then capped off and the
water drained. The inside can then be pressurized, built out, and
planted. Cole bubbles can also be spun for gravity, according to the
whims of the inhabitants, though the gravity lowers as you near the
poles of the bubble, with zero gravity at the axis of rotation.
   Cole bubbles are among the largest structures transhumanity has
created in space. The largest Cole habitat, Extropia, has a popula-
tion of 10 million.

HAMILTON CYLINDERS
Hamilton cylinders are a new technology. There are only three fully
operational Hamilton cylinders in the system, but the design shows
great promise and is likely to be widely adopted over the coming
period. Hamilton cylinders are grown using a complex genomic
algorithm that orchestrates nanoscale building machines. These
nanobots build the habitat slowly over time, a process more like
growing than construction.
   Similar to O’Neill cylinders and Cole bubbles, a Hamilton cylin-
der is a cylindrical habitat rotating on its long axis to provide grav-
ity. Two of the known Hamilton cylinders orbit Saturn in positions
skimming the rings near the Cassini division. From this position,
they can graze on silicates and volatiles using harvester ships.
   None of the currently-operating Hamilton cylinders have grown
to full size yet, but estimates say they could each house up to 3
million people.

Found mostly in the orbits of Earth, Luna, Venus, and Mars, O’Neill
cylinders were among transhumanity’s first large space habitat de-

signs. O’Neill cylinders are no longer built, having been replaced
by more efficient designs, but are still home to tens of millions of
transhumans. O’Neill cylinders were constructed from metals mined
on Luna or Mercury, Lunar volatiles (including Lunar polar ice),
and asteroidal silicates.

TIME
Once the raw materials and blueprints are in, most nanofabrica-
tion is simply a matter of time. The exact timeframe to create an
object varies, but roughly approximates 1 hour per cost category of
the item (1 hour for Trivial, 2 for Low, 3 for Moderate, etc.). The
gamemaster may feel free to modify this period as appropriate for
the object.

THE PROGRAMMING TEST
Nanofabrication is typically handled as a Programming (Nanofab-
rication) Test. In most cases, this can be treated as a Simple Success
Test (p. 118), with a failed roll simply indicating that the item has
some minor imperfections, or perhaps took longer to make.
   In some cases, the gamemaster may call for an actual Success Test,
meaning that failure is more of a possibility. This should only be
done for items that are exotic, extremely complicated, or for which
the blueprints are incomplete or otherwise suspect. This test can also
be made if the raw materials are limited.
   The character operating the nanofabricator can make this test or
it can be left up to the nanofabricator’s built-in AI. Most such Such
AIs have a Programming (Nanofabrication) skill of 30 (see AIs and
Muses, p. 331).



REPUTATION AND SOCIAL NETWORKS
“Once upon a time, there was a planet so incredibly primitive that its
 inhabitants still used money. That planet is called ‘Mars.’”
   —Professor Magnus Ming, Titan Autonomous University

The conflict between market capitalism and other forms of eco-
nomics is one of transhumanity’s last great culture wars, and it’s
still being fought. Transhumanity’s expansion into the solar system
created myriad opportunities to experiment with new economic sys-
tems. Many failed, but the reputation economies of the outer system
have proven both utilitarian and robust in a way that no previous
challenger to market capitalism has managed.
   The reputation economy, sometimes called the gift economy or
open economy, is one in which the material plenty created by nano-
fabrication and the longevity granted by uploading and backups
have removed considerations of supply versus scarcity from the
economic equation—destroying classical economics in the process.
   The regimented societies of the inner system and the Jovian
Junta have used societal controls and careful regulation of the
technologies of abundance on their populations, thus keeping to a
transitional economy system that is largely an outgrowth of classi-
cal economics. No one could get away with doing this in the outer

system. In the Trojans and Greeks, much of the belt, free Jupiter, and
anywhere outward from Saturn, the reputation economy rules.

Combat drugs are an easy way of evening the odds
in a fight.
   BringIt: In some respects more a social than a
combat drug, BringIt stimulates massive bursts of ag-
gression pheromones designed to make the user the
center of attention in a fight. In combat, opponents
within 3 meters of the character not already in un-
armed or melee combat with another character must
pass a WIL x 3 Test or attack the character using Br-
ingIt. The nature of airborne pheromones is imprecise,
however, so if the character using BringIt is within
1 meter of another character hostile to the character
affected, the affected character may opt to attack the
proximate character instead of the BringIt user. Char-
acters using this drug suffer a –20 modifier on social
skill tests. [Low]
   Grin: Grin is an effective opiate and pain sup-
pressant. Users may ignore the –10 modifiers from
2 wounds (not cumulative with similar effects), and
in fact may not even be aware they are injured. Grin
users suffer from tunnel vision, however, and so suffer
a –10 modifier on Perception Tests. [Low]
   Kick: Kick is a strong stimulant that increases the
user’s response time and puts them on edge. The char-
acter gains +10 REF and +1 Speed for the duration of
the drug. Characters under the influence of Kick are
twitchy, however, reacting in a jumpy, cat-like fashion
to sudden or unexpected stimuli. At the gamemaster’s
discretion, they must make a WIL x 2 Test or react
without thinking towards unexpected noises or other
surprises. Long-term users suffer –5 COO. [Moderate]
   MRDR: MRDR is a straightforward and brutal
combat drug. It increases pain tolerance, speed, and
strength. The character receives +10 SOM, +1 Speed,
+10 Durability, and may ignore the –10 modifier of
one wound. Any damage incurred while under the
effects of the drug is taken from the bonus Durabil-
ity first. MRDR users are easily identifiable by the
broken blood vessels in their eyes, tense posture, and
visible tension in the muscles of the face, arms, and
legs. Long-term users suffer –5 SOM. [Low]
   Phlo: Phlo increases alertness and coordination,
making the user more graceful and nimble in a fray.
The character gains +5 COO and +10 on Perception
Tests for the duration of the drug. Everything feels
possible to a character on Phlo, and so they are vul-
                                                                           GEAR

configurations, requiring less than a day in a well-
equipped maintenance facility. However, vessels using
hydrogen oxygen engines cannot be converted. Since
metallic hydrogen is a much more efficient propellant,
landers using it always include significant amounts of
extra propellant for emergencies.
   Scum Barge: These huge craft were originally de-
signed for use during the first stages of the evacuation
of Earth. They were built to carry up to 20,000 people
and to allow them to survive for months or even years,
in relatively cramped conditions, until more suitable
habitats could be constructed. A number of these ves-
sels are still in service, primarily used as mobile habi-
tats by various anarchic subcultures. The best have
had their plasma rockets replaced by modern fusion
rockets and carry 5-10,000 in relative comfort. The
worst use aging plasma rockets and stretch their life
support systems and living spaces to the limit, carry-
ing up to 25,000 poor and desperate residents.
   Small Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (SLOTV):
This vehicle is identical in use and design to the
LLOTV, except that it is one third the total mass and
correspondingly less expensive to build and refuel.
Some exceptionally wealthy individuals own private
small LOTVs. Using a small LOTV with a hydrogen-
oxygen engine to take off and land on Venus or for
other high velocity uses is exceptionally cramped
and allows for absolutely no room for error. Like the
LLOTV, this vehicle can be easily converted between
low and high velocity configurations and is made in
both streamlined and non-streamlined versions.
   Standard Transport: This vessel is one of the most
common freighter and passenger vessel in the solar
system. While egocasting is by far the most common
form of inter-habitat transport, some people prefer to
travel by ship and others do not wish to leave their
current morph behind. In addition, some goods are
easier or cheaper to physically transport rather than
duplicating their templates. As a result, standard
transports regularly travel to and from every large
habitat and inhabited planet and moon in the solar
system. These are modern fusion-drive ships that offer
fast and comfortable travel for passengers as well as
relatively swift transport for small cargoes.
   One of the additional benefits of the standard
transport is the fact that it contains four separate pas-
                                                                              GEAR

              SPOILER ALERT
              If you’re a player and not a gamemaster, we strongly recommend you skip this chapter, as it presents
              secrets and other information that can ruin your enjoyment of the game. No, really, stop reading, we mean
              it. Ok, maybe you’re obsessive and you want to know everything about the game—you did buy this book
              after all. But really, do you read the last chapter of a book ﬁrst, so you know how it ends? Do you ask for
              the punchline before hearing the joke? Do you wait for a movie to come out and read the reviews with
              full spoilers before you go see it? Ok, maybe you do, and in that case, be our guest, read away. Just keep
              in mind that some of the things here may change your perspective during game play. A good roleplayer
              can swing that, though, and maybe you’re a control freak info-junkie that prefers to know it all. Hrm, in
              retrospect, so we are we, so we can respect that. Keep in mind, however, that by reading this chapter, you

                                       of proxies learning new skill sets and increasing their
                                       usefulness to Firewall. The actions of each server are
                                       kept as transparent as possible, with major decisions
                                       brought to an e-vote before the entire proxy member-
                                       ship. However, speed often requires servers or indi-
                                       vidual proxies to move quicker than a vote will allow.
                                       In all such instances, the proxies involved are held
                                       accountable for those actions, reviewed by their peers
                                       at a later time to see if any reprimands, punishments,
                                       or commendations are required.
                                          It is important to note that there is no core leader-
                                       ship structure among the proxies. No one person or
                                       cabal is in charge, there is no authority held by one
                                       proxy or another; all are peers. Though reputation
                                       and experience play a factor, getting something done
                                       often means convincing other proxies that it’s the
                                       right thing to do. The drawback to being a leader
                                       or person with initiative within Firewall is that this
                                       usually means you must follow through with such
                                       tasks yourself. Luckily most proxies are dedicated
                                       to Firewall’s goals and so this DIY attitude prevails.
                                       Despite these safeguards, however, rumors of power
                                       blocks within Firewall (both within servers and
                                       across the organization) exist. Many of these are
                                       fueled by the alliances different cliques hold with
                                       each other. Others, however, whisper that there is
                                       a secret council among the proxies, working behind
