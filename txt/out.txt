 everyone who contributed time, sweat, ideas, and
 money into it to everyone who picks it up, reads
 it, and plays it. This game is by you and for you.
 Secondly it’s dedicated to my grandmother and to
 Andrea, both important people in my life who died
 while I was working on this book and its themes
 of defeating death. I sincerely hope that one day
 such tragic losses are avoided. Third, this book is
 dedicated to my son Echo, my entertaining working
 companion on this project. Finally this book is dedi-
 cated to those visionaries, especially the anarchists
 and transhumanists, who are working to bring about
 a fantastic future, starting now. —Rob Boyle

# Lack

“What’s the number?”

  The word dig their claws into my new vocal cords and yank themselves up and out of my parched throat.
My diction is predictably poor, as it always is during the first few minutes following a resleeve. The pitch
of the voice is apparent despite the mumbled, sandpaper slur of the words. Definitely a biomorph and my
latest sex is female. This much I know in the first few seconds. The model eludes me right now, but I’ll know
for certain soon enough, once motion is mine again. Another fury morph is my first guess.
  The slab is hard. Nothing more than frigid metal with crisp white synth-slick wrapped around it. Typical
accommodations for a corp dollhouse. The chill seeps through my skin and wraps around my bones.
  A cortical cruncher looms over me, waving his welcome-back beam side to side, occasionally catching my
pupils. His smug, bored face speaks: “Consciousness confirmed.” The beam clicks off. My question should
have made it obvious that I am back, but the guy is a slave to procedure. They all are. Corporate body
banks like their employees paralyzed by obedience, unable to think for themselves. I mumble the question
again. “What’s the number?”
  “March 11.”
  “How many after the Fall?”
  “Are you for real?”

> I am paranoid. Yes. I need to know the year every time I return upon a body
> bank slab. Paranoia is just one of the plagues transhumanity faces these days.

  I try to snag the data from my new sleeve’s mesh inserts before opening my mouth again. No luck. Asking
a sleeve tech for the year is always humiliating. Makes me feel like an amateur, but the circumstances are
definitely extenuating, so I press him. Hard.
  “Answer the fucking question.”
  The corp sloth gives me the lunatic eye before he answers.
  “Uh ... 10 AF. You haven’t been gone that long. Your last backup ... “
  He scans his entoptics for the info.
  “ ... 14 days, 7 hours ago.”
  It takes a second to sink in, but when it does, it stings. It never ceases to shock when time slips away from
me. Two weeks. Gone. Completely wiped from my existence. Two weeks ago, there was another me, sleeved
in another morph. There was a mission and it led to my death. That is all I know. Either Firewall failed
to retrieve the cortical stack off the corpse so I could retain those two weeks, or the fuckers deliberately
chose to swipe that time from me. Honestly, though, both possibilities are preferable to having another self
 bouncing around out there, doing who knows what-the-fuck. Some t-humies get off on having multiple
 selves traipsing all over, but my ego is in check. One Sava is enough misery to unleash on the ‘verse.
  Shit. My brain is wandering off into morose territory; always does during the first moments following a
resleeve. I need a physical context. Something tangible to focus my attention on. I bring my hands in front
of my eyes, arms feeling like two-ton sacks of rocks. The fingers are thin and long; the knuckles callused,
scarred and misshapen. Obviously the work of many thrown punches, fists connecting with jaws, metal,
flesh. Yep. A well-worn fury morph. You get what you pay for, I suppose; or what Firewall is willing to pay
for. Why do I do it? As far as the org is concerned, I’m nothing more than a cheap precision instrument,
tossed into the recycling bin when I snap in half. There will always be more of me, until the horrors prove
too intense, until the files get too corrupt, until I know too much and Firewall decides to wipe me, then
some other sap will step in to preserve transhumanity. Preserve transhumanity. Fantastic. Now I’m babbling
like a Firewall propaganda tweet! My arms weaken and flop back to my sides. The strength just isn’t there
yet. A few more minutes with nothing but my thoughts.
  On his way out of the recovery bay, the cort cruncher laughs at my feeble attempt at motion. “What’s
your hurry?” he says. “Just relax, willya? You collapse onto the floor, you’re gonna stay there until you get
yourself up. They don’t pay me enough to babysit newbies.” His flippancy doesn’t help my mood and the
melancholy returns.
  What experiences are no longer a part of my consciousness? Perhaps the thrill of a lifetime. Did I discover
true beauty? Fall in love? Have an epiphany? Save a life? I’ll never know. Those memories, that life, that
version of me, is gone. The new me, lying on this slab, was never shaped by those experiences. My chest
hollows out from the weight of the loss.
   I gotta shift the thought process.
   Fuck it. Maybe there was no joy, no revelations. It
was a shit two weeks. I’m certain of it. I was bored
out of my mind. Better yet, broken and suffering
from an epic heartache. My demise was meaningless.
I OD’d on kick, flopping on the floor in a pathetic
speed-addled frenzy till my heart exploded. I was
gutted by some low-life scumborn in a back station
corridor over some lo-rez black market XP. I’m glad
the time was wiped. Ecstatic, in fact. Fuck it. Fuck
them. I don’t need those two weeks.
   But these thoughts are lies. I need those two weeks.
I don’t feel whole without them. Hell, I feel incom-
plete if even an hour is sacrificed. I have to know.
   Someone knows what occurred. No doubt. Prob-
ably a Firewall proxy, Jesper most likely. He was my
connect this go round. I remember that much. The
wipe would have been his call. And proxies have a
quick trigger finger when it comes to wiping us sen-
tinels. Even a hard-earned rep score can’t save my
memories when Firewall deems the results of a mis-
sion too sensitive for an outer circle thug like myself
to possess. As long as the fucking job gets done. As
long as transhumanity perseveres.
   What a shit deal.
   How did my life, my lives, come to this? Always in
the hands of another.
  Again, the dread, the paranoia. I gotta shake this
off. I have to give the org the benefit of the doubt.
I’ve been a sentinel for decades. I like to think I’ve
saved millions of lives, but I’m just not sure.
   Do I trust the org? No. But there is an understand-
ing, a degree of respect. Though as the years continue
to race by, and the gaps grow longer and more fre-
quent, I’m beginning to doubt Firewall’s commitment
to my preservation.
   Suddenly, my muse stirs, breaking my dark
reverie. Several entoptic displays appear in
my field of vision, cycling through diagnostic
routines as my mesh inserts finally come online.
Careza’s familiar feminine voice enters my mind.
   [Welcome back, Sava.]
   The sound is soothing; like being cradled by my
mother, or embraced by a lover. The harmonic
upgrade was a worthwhile investment. Careza
has learned to use it well. I rarely think of my
muse as an AI. It is my only true friend these
days. I wonder if it shares the sentiment. I’ve never
shot the thought its way. I keep it to myself. I’m afraid
of what the response might be.
   Hey Careza. Glad to be back.
   [You could use a drink, I suspect.]
  You know me too well, Car. Better than I know
myself.
   [Hospitality now has the request. Wait time, approximately
ten minutes.]
   Thanks. Careza enjoys our conversations when
my brain has a slight buzz. It is always trying to get
me drunk.
   [You’re welcome, Sava. Before you ask, it’s been two weeks.
I don’t have any information on what happened following our
last resleeve. Currently, we are in lunar orbit aboard Selardi IV.
We are outfitted in a CoreCorp-brand fury morph with minor
enhancements. They will be online shortly. I am pleased to
report the Titanians were victorious and won the Cup.]
   Damnit. Would have made a killing on that one.
What did the odds go off at? But before Careza can
dig up the info, I shut down the operation. Wait. No.
I don’t want to know. It’ll only irritate me more. A
nervous energy starts to itch my entire system and a
thick familiar taste begins to coat my tongue. I need
a cigarette.
   [Yes. I know. The previous occupant of this morph was a
heavy smoker. The habit might be difficult to shake this time.]
   This resleeve just keeps getting better by the minute.
I hate smoking. Booze, fine. I can handle my alcohol,
but smoking always makes me feel like shit. Every
time I get sleeved in a morph with the addiction, I
struggle to kick it. Careza continues with her report
as I try to retain my sanity in the face of an intense
nicotine craving.
   [@-rep remains intact.]
   Finally some good news. At least I didn’t piss off
any allies in the past 2 weeks.
   [Indeed. Are you in the right frame of mind for an update
on Rati?]
   Rati is my passion. The lover I hold above all others.
She disappeared on me two years ago. No explanation.
The sting still lingers.
   Let’s skip the update for now, Careza.
   [Understood.]
   Run a newsfeed scan. Check for any major incidents
in the past 2 weeks. Maybe there’s a clue as to what
we may have been up to.
   As Careza runs the scan and continues her standard
sitrep, I shift my attention to the new sleeve. The
strength to stand is finally there. I push the morph
up and swing the feet onto the floor. Spasms
shoot through every muscle. New morphs
always take a bit of time in which to acclimate.
Luckily, I’m familiar with the CoreCorp fury,
sleeved it a few times in the past. This one feels
like an old pair of shoes, bit worn and abused,
but able to pound the pavement if need be. The
left ankle is a bit tender. I hold it up a bit to get
a look. Bit swollen. Definitely not new sleeve dys-
morphia. Probably a nagging injury. Again, a pain
in the ass, but you get what you pay for, I suppose.
The nanotat encircling the right bicep is rude and ob-
noxious, even by scum standards—an entire slitheroid
entering the genitals of a female pleasure pod, fully
animated. Class act, whoever opted to etch that upon
the morph. I hate identifying marks, but again, if you
can’t afford a clean morph, you take what you can get.
   I slide off the table, managing not to fall over in the
process, and gingerly test the ankle. Sore, but it isn’t
going to snap off.
   Put in a request for a patch, left ankle. Bute should
be fine.

   [Phenylbutazone. On it’s way. And the cocktail will be
 here in approximately 30 seconds. Nothing unusual on the
 newsfeed scan.]
   Figures.

“Hand me my drink please.” I reach out my hand in
his direction without even acknowledging his presence.
He steps into the room, too close to me, and slips the
drink into my hand. His breath smells like some sort
of sour sausage.
  “Not too bad under the sheet, are you?” he says. “I
took a peek earlier, but I must say, the slab didn’t do
you justice. On your feet, the curves really pop. Your
face isn’t much to look at, but that rack is ... ”
   I cut him off before I vomit bile into my mouth. “It’s
exquisite. I know. Now shut up and back off before
I rip the skin off your face and slap you silly with it.”
He gets the message and slinks from the room.
   It is a nice rack.
   [If nice is defined by proportion, then I would say yes.]
   AIs, always so formal.
   [You’re approximately 4 centimeters taller than your usual
proprieception allows for, so watch your head.]
   Thanks for the heads up.
   [That was awful.]
   Yeah. Yeah. I know. A smile finds its way onto my
face as the banter with my muse lightens my mood.
Looking in the mirror, I try to broaden the smile, to
get a better sense of my new face. I show some teeth.
Nicotine stains all over them. I take a long sip from
my cocktail, swish the alcohol around a bit. I can feel
my blood respond instantly to the sauce. I close my
eyes and let out a sigh. Just a few moments of peace
is all I ask.
   [We have a guest, Sava.] Damnit. No such luck.
   Who?
   [Our last Firewall proxy, Jesper, has sent a beta-level fork of
himself. It is rather impatient to speak with you.]
   Connect him.
   They just cannot leave me alone, can they? Offi-
cially, Firewall doesn’t even exist. It’s because of Rati
that they got their tentacles wrapped all around me,
through me. The whole mess on Mars. That’s where
it all started. The last time I saw Rati. All that knowl-
edge they allowed me to retain. But why? Until that
day, I had never realized just how scary the universe
truly was. No, not scary. Horrific. No other word for
something so vast, so uncaring. Transhumanity could
be wiped out completely and it would all just con-
tinue on as before. Horrific. No other way to explain
the feeling you have when you come face to face with
things truly beyond comprehension. Hell, no other
term could encapsulate transhumanity’s actions to-
wards each other—much less what other beings lurk-
ing in the void have in store for us. Perhaps that was
why. To teach me a lesson. To make certain I would
never forget, so I would never cease assisting
the org, because even the briefest glimpse of
what is actually out there is enough.
   Jesper’s fork materializes in my field of
vision.
   [Welcome back, Sava.]
   Fuck off, Jesper. You know I hate
waking up with lack.
   [Sorry. Nothing I could do.] His expression
is serious and concerned, but his kinesics
indicate he is as calm as can be. What an
act! Fucking proxies never panic. They
hold all the cards and it’s never their minds
that are on the line.
   Yeah. Right. Get to the point. You don’t have me
sleeved in a combat morph to get some downtime, so
you must have something serious lined up. Are Berk,
Pivo, and Sarlo here?
   [Yes, they have been resleeved in the same facility.]
   At least my team is with me. People I could count
on. To a certain degree.
   All right. What are the details?




Pivo gripped the smooth outer surface of the station
with all eight arms. Nano-magnetics at the tips of
his vacsuit arms were the only difference between a
secure hold and an endless drift into the depths of
space. He peered up through his faceplate at the dark
orb above him.
   Earth.
   His eyes locked on an expanse of dead black ocean
through the ominous clouds. Pivo longed to swim in
those ancient depths. Born and bred for space, he had
never once immersed himself in the former ecological
niche of his kind. Odds were against his ever taking
a plunge into the salty waters of an Earth ocean. The
planet was now a plagued death trap. A wasteland of
skeletal forms.
   He imagined a time before the Fall, when his ances-
tors thrust through blue waters and slipped effortless-
ly through mazes of coral, or gently floated along with
the current, not bothered by the burden of sapience.
Perhaps octopi still survived beneath the black waters
of the present, eking out a brief existence, biding their
time, keeping the species true and alive until the Earth
could be reclaimed, and Pivo would join them on that
glorious day, abandoning knowledge altogether, and
returning to the ways of instinct.
  Vacsuit sensors interrupted Pivo’s fanta-
sy, detecting a laser light that bathed his
form—contact from Sava by line-of-sight
laser link. It was the preferred method of
communication when a mission required
discretion. Pivo’s muse processed the mes-
sage, and Sava’s voice entered his head.
   [Something wrong? Why’d you stop
moving?]
   [Just enjoying the view,] Pivo beamed back.
   [Enjoy it on the way down, for hours if you
want. Get inside the station before one of the
sentry bots finds us.]
   Pivo didn’t bother to respond. There
was no arguing with Sava. No use in de-
fending your actions. Pivo began crawling
along the shell of the station again. The
station itself was tethered to the end of a
long, black, carbon nanotube cable that
stretched all the way down to the planet’s
surface—the sole surviving space elevator.
   Pivo located the breach, a thin scar in
the station’s metallic hull, the result of an
internal explosion responsible for the station’s
demise during the Fall. The breach was exactly where
Sava said it would be and the description of its size
was dead-on: a gap barely large enough for a human
infant to slip through. According to Sava, years ago,
the self-repairing nanosystems operating in the hull’s
metal had malfunctioned before the breach had been
fully repaired. The level of mission details Sava man-
aged to extract from Firewall was scary sometimes.
Paranoia bloomed for a moment, but he quickly dis-
missed his suspicion, compressed his cephalopod form,
and squeezed his body through the breach.
   In blackness, Pivo activated his infrared emitter,
casting the room in a light outside the normal visual
spectrum. The interior of the lifeless station became
visible to his enhanced eyes in the eerie altered colors
of infrared. Pivo almost preferred the dark. Ice crys-
tals glittered from every surface, the reult of flash
frozen moisture in the long-absent atmosphere. Frigid
clumps of human remains floated alongside chunks of
hull metal in a macabre zero-gravity ballet. Pivo float-
ed through the wreckage and the gore, lightly tapping
aside metal or flesh to clear a path deeper into the
room. A female head drifted slowly by, the face frozen
in a gaping silent scream. An intact cortical stack
dangled from the severed neck. For a second, Pivo
considered snatching the stack, but he was not here to
retrieve lost souls. Instead, he placed two of his arms
upon the top of the head and pushed it beneath him,
towards the floor. Like so many others lost during the
Fall, this person would remain forgotten here.
   Pivo made it to the airlock without incident, but
he knew his luck would run dry eventually. A run-in
with hypercorp guardians on a derelict station was
unavoidable. Sensors may have already detected his
presence. It was only a matter of time before bots
converged on his position. He just hoped that when
it occurred (and it most certainly would), it would
happen after he had opened up the airlock and the
rest of the team was inside the station.
   The airlock had been welded shut from the inside.
Pivo was prepared for this eventuality, but it made his
detection by guardian bots a certainty. He composed
himself for a few seconds, focused on the task at hand,
then fired up the plasma torch built into one of his
vacsuit arms. A sizzling hiss and a harsh hot blue glare
filled the room. Seconds were now his most precious
possession.
   He was almost through the inner door when his
muse pinged him with a warning from the passive
teraherz sensor. An object was moving towards Pivo’s
position rapidly, now only twenty meters away. A
sentry bot would be upon him in soon.
   [Almost through the first door,] Pivo transmitted calmly,
even though it took every ounce of his will to keep
the torch steady. [I have company. Be ready.]
   [Copy that,] Sava replied.
   Finally, Pivo cut through the seal. The octomorph
slithered four arms through the still smoldering sliced
metal, and with a strained yank, pulled the door from
the frame. The door slowly floated away into the
chamber, the edges rapidly cooling. The interior air-
lock door was not welded shut. With a vocal sigh of
relief, all eight of Pivo’s arms began a frenzied assault
upon the airlock door’s manual controls.
   [Few more seconds. Just a few more seconds.] But the
seconds had expired.
   In his 360-degree field of vision, Pivo could see the
security bot thrust into view behind him. The bot un-
loaded its weapons immediately, the shots ricocheting
off the floating airlock door. The bot advanced on the
door, and with a furious swat knocked the obstruc-
tion aside. It clanged upon the crystalline surface of
the wall. Just as Pivo pulled the last lever to release
the airlock door, blazing plasma fire engulfed him.



Sava had instructed Careza to surge the neurochem
the instant the airlock portal was open. The muse
did not fail to deliver. In what seemed like an eternal
slow-mo to Sava’s charged brain, the airlock door
swung open into the station, aided by a thudding steel
leg kick courtesy of Berk, the team’s muscle. With a
flash of thought, Sava’s targeting radar snapped up an
entoptic display and locked on two targets: Pivo and
a sentry bot. The robotic guard dog was already level-
ing its weapons, but Sava was faster. Retinal-searing
plasma fire erupted from Sava’s weapon, singeing
one of Pivo’s arms and slamming the sentry back. A
second shot punched through the bot’s armored cara-
pace, melting critical components within, rendering
the bot a useless pile of fused scrap metal.
   Sava moved quickly past the cursing octomorph
and unloaded two more shots into the smoking bot.
   [We’re clear,] Sava transmitted. [One down, but there is
always more. Count on it. Pivo, you shiny?]
   [You scorched my breeding arm, puta.] Pivo shot back
with clear agitation rumbling in the harmonics.
   [You rather I leave you to the bot next time?] Sava turned
to Sarlo. [Sarlo, get in here and find the console you need.
Berk, we’re going to need to set up defensive positions, to
give hacker boy here time to crunch his bits.]
   Pivo cut through his vacsuit and detached his dam-
aged arm, cursing Sava under his breath as the vacsuit
rapidly repaired itself and sealed the gap.
   [Hey. Don’t worry, Pivo. You’ve got seven more. And besides,
you don’t really strike me as the breeding type anyway.] Sava
relished giving Pivo a hard time. It was one of the true
joys in life.
   Pushing off from one wall to the next, Sarlo moved
along the chamber with ease and grace. His neotenic
morph was slighter and even more diminutive than
the average human child sleeve, completely augment-
ed and customized to match his “preferences.” He had
paid a fortune for it. The others never understood
Sarlo’s penchant for juvenile human sleeves, so much
so that he always kicked in his own credits to ensure
an augmented neotenic resleeve, even when Firewall
was footing the bill. They also didn’t know where his
seemingly endless supply of personal funds came from,
nor did they want to. As long as he got the job done.
   Two minidrones followed after Sarlo, lighting
the area in infrared and actively scanning
on other wavelengths. [This way,] he said,
transmitting an entoptic map to each team


member’s overlay. [It’s not far, a hundred
meters or so.] A highlighted route appeared on
the map.
   Sava and Pivo followed closely behind
Sarlo, while Berk struggled to keep pace in
her armored gynoid shell.
   [Keep up, ﬂatlander. We’ll be down the gravity
well soon enough,] Sava beamed to Berk.
   [Not soon enough for me,] Berk replied.
   The abandoned station was eerily quiet.
Signs of long-forgotten violence and desper-
ation lingered everywhere. Floating debris.
Ruptured and frozen bodies. Scorch marks
and twisted metal. Death owned this place.
   When the team reached the control station,
Sava and Berk took up defensive positions
in the corridor while Sarlo and Pivo went to
work on the station’s dormant systems.
   [I’ll be damned! The mission spec was actually
right. The station systems are active but dormant.
Whomever’s guarding this place didn’t wreck the
systems, they left open the possibility that the space eleva-
tor could be activated again.] Sarlo gleefully began his
procedures to hack the system.
   [Who the fuck would want to risk going down to that ball
of ash?] Berk piped in.
   Pivo waved one of his arms in agitation. [Need I
remind you that some of us happen to think that reclaiming
our home planet is a good idea?]
   [Reactionary thinking, if you ask me.] Berk replied.
[Shrugging off all of our old nation-state loyalties is one of
the best steps transhumanity has ever made. Leave reveling
in the glories of the past to the bio-cons. I’ll take a future
where we step boldly outward into space, thank you much.]
   [Let’s cut the politics.] Sava pointed at Berk. [You’re
an anarchist, I get it.] Then Sava pointed at Pivo. [And
you’re on a reclamation kick. Fine.] But Sava’s rant was
interrupted by half a dozen fast moving dots upon
the team’s entoptic radars. [Incoming pings. Sarlo, you
in yet?]
   [Working on it. Fuck. Fuck. Shit.] Sarlo’s childish voice
sounded petulant.
   [Work faster. If these bots have heavy ordnance, we’re
screwed.] Sava and Berk both unloaded suppression
fire down their respective stretches of corridor before
the bots even made it to the corners. The bots halted
their approach momentarily, taking cover just around
the bend. More bots began to appear on the radar,
moving towards the position of the first responders.
   [We’re running out of time, Sar! More bots gathering!]
Sava unloaded another round of suppression at the
bend. Berk kept her weapon quiet, waiting for a bot
to make a move into the corridor before lighting it up,
but the bots remained put. More gathered, and even
more appeared on radar, moving to the same position.
   [They’re gonna be all over us any second now!]
   [Consider this a gift, ladies and gents ... ] And with a
final operation, Sarlo seized control of the station’s
entire security system.
   Suddenly, one of the bots turned on the others.
Another soon joined it. In a matter of seconds,
fumes and debris came drifting down the corridor
as all-out warfare broke out between the bots. Sava
and Berk lowered their weapons and admired the
sounds of Sarlo’s handiwork.
   [Damn, Sar! I guess that is why you are one of the best
hackers in the system!]
   [Applause, applause, ya waify freak!]
   [When you’ve got cutting edge-exploits courtesy of the
leet coding AGIs on Extropia, there’s not a whole lot you can’t
do.] Sarlo delivered the line with a calm harmonic, but
Sava was watching his kinesics, and they were off the
charts. The neotenic’s little heart was beating like a
drum roll. Sava opted not to bust his furless balls
about it, and instead let Sarlo have his moment in
the sun. This had been a “close one,” and another
close one might not end up in their favor.
   Sava allowed a few seconds of relieved silence
before getting the team back to business. [Sarlo. How
soon till the elevator is active?]




Pivo stuck to the portal, watching as they descended
below the soot-filled layer of clouds and the Earth
below came into view. They were in the atmosphere
now, descending on a taut beanstalk stretched be-
tween the Earth and station above, a massive feat of
engineering built from carbon nanotubes. The shuttle
car crawled down the elevator cable, bringing them
closer and closer to the ruined planet.
   Earth’s atmosphere was now choked with a thick
dust, the color of rust. The winds whipped over the
planet’s surface with breakneck velocity, swirling
dangerously in certain pockets. The world’s weather
systems had been irretrievably ravaged by the Fall,
when transhumanity had seemingly gone to war with
a group of rogue AIs known as the TITANs. Bombs,
raging fires, chemical attacks, biowar plagues, vora-
cious nanoswarms—even nukes—had taken their toll.
It was now an inhospitable place, gripped by nuclear
winter. Some of the clouds were formed into unusual
shapes, defying the high winds, even seeming to writhe
as they moved—the thriving descendents of self-rep-
licating airborne nanoswarms, Pivo suspected. Who
knew what other monstrosities waited for them below,
evolved from the remnants of AI war machines?
   The Earth was off-limits now. Abandoned to the
enemy. Though the TITANs were presumed to be
long gone, escaping the solar system via secretly-con-
structed wormholes gates, taking millions of forcibly
uploaded transhuman minds with them—they had left
many of their tools and weapons behind. Likewise,
some of the weapons transhumanity had unleashed
on the AIs—and, quite often, themselves—had taken
on a life of their own. So Earth had been abandoned
and interdicted, with hypercorp killsats laced into
orbit to shoot down anything that attempted to leave
or land on the planet’s surface.
   As a reclaimer, Pivo was part of a small but vocal
faction that advocated a return to Earth. There was
still hope for the planet, they believed. It had always
perservered, and this was no time to give up on it.
Earth needed to be cleansed and terraformed, resusci-
tating transhumanity’s home. But the reclamers were
a minority. To most survivors of the Fall, the Earth
held too many horrible memories. Lives ruined. Loved
ones lost. Their own deaths. It was a monument to
transhumanity’s arrogance and mistakes, a grim
reminder that they were not above destroying them-
selves despite all of their advances and technology, or
perhaps because of them.
   This didn’t prevent some from trying, of course.
Scavengers still raided the planet’s ruins, retrieving
long-lost treasures, cultural artifacts, or even the
preserved mind-states of those who failed to escape.
Some reclaimers had initiated their own secret mis-
sions, intending to establish a basecamp from which
they would begin operating their own reclamation
projects. Most were never heard from again.
   The team of four rested and prepared equipment
in the shuttle’s large open lounge, Sava and Sarlo
in a cramped inflatable survival bubble so the bio-
morphs could escape the confines of their vacsuits
for a while. Pivo elected to remain outside the
bubble and in the vacsuit. Close confines with Sava
during the descent did not sound pleasant to him.
The walls of the lounge were smeared with decades-
old blood, now frozen into a crystalline brown in
the depressurized cabin. Whoever the last passengers
were to ride this shuttle, fleeing the doomed Earth,
must have set violently upon each other, fueled by
madness or despair.
   [I wonder what it was like.] Sarlo tossed the thought
out to the group.
   [What?] Pivo replied.
   Sava quickly jumped in and put an end to the dis-
cussion Sarlo was yearning to start. [Quit with the phi-
losophizing and the dramatizing. You know I cannot stand that
shit.] Sava tried desperately to maintain order and an
air of gruff detachment. It was too easy to let the brain
wander off into the past and the fate of the millions
who perished during the Fall. To counter this, Sava
always resorted to the diatribe. [Listen. We all know the
mission specs. We’re locating someone. A courier. Most likely
a corpse. Last known position while alive was the base sta-
tion we will drop into when this ride stops. Mount Kilimanjaro.
Which, according to quite reliable sources, was once overrun
by killbots, which are most likely still in the vicinity.] Sava
paused for dramatic effect before continuing. [We
retrieve something from the courier. What, we don’t fucking
know. Only that it is quite valuable to the org. We stick to what
we know. I don’t want to hear any more bullshit “what ifs”
and “I wonders.” If your thoughts are anywhere other than
the mission, keep them to yourself. I don’t want to hear them.]
And with that declaration, the rest of the journey to
the Kilimanjaro station was in silence, each confined
to their own thoughts, not a single ping between them.




The shuttle rattled to a stop inside the dark cavern-
ous hangar. At one time, the Kilimanjaro hangar was
the busiest Earth-to-space station port in the world,
servicing millions of customers annually. Now, as
Pivo clung to a shuttle window and stared out into
the black emptiness of the hangar, it seemed as if the
place was a soulless vacuum.
   [Ready when you are.] Sarlo pinged Sava, poised
to hack open the shuttle door and allow the stale
dust-choked air of Earth to waft over the team. Sava
nodded to Sarlo and the shuttle door slid open with
a rush of decompression. A blinding red-gray dust
blasted into the shuttle from the hangar and coated
the shuttle interior almost immediately.
   Sava’s first step into the Kilimanjaro hangar landed
firmly onto the brittle ribcage of a child’s skeleton.
The bones snapped into splinters and powder with a
crunch. The floor surrounding the shuttle airlock was
carpeted with skeletons entangled in a mass of tattered
clothing. There was no way to avoid stepping upon
them. One by one, the others stepped from the airlock.
   [This place is a tomb,] Berk beamed to the group.
   [This whole planet is a tomb,] Sava replied, with an
extra echo harmonic allowing the word tomb to con-
tinue on well after the phrase was transmitted, added
specifically to annoy Pivo, who immediately shut
down the echo in his head with a countermeasure
from his muse.
   Sava took a few more crunching steps forward,
then stopped. The rest of the team followed suit.
   [Something is not right here.] Sava kicked at one of the
skeletons. The bones rattled and cracked. [I don’t see
any skulls.]
   [Forced uploading,] Sarlo transmitted. [TITAN machines
harvested the heads of the dead for scanning.] He shrugged.
[That’s my guess, anyway.]
   [Shut up!] Sava signaled the team to silence. [Who
else hears that?]
   A low mechanical whir reverberated nearby. [I’m
picking it up.] Pivo replied. [Up a bit to the north. About
30 meters.] As if in response to Pivo’s observation, an-
other whir began, this one behind the team, from the
south end of the hangar. Another whir from the east
joined in the chorus. The sounds were coming closer,
becoming more distinct, more aggressive.
   [No visual, yet. This fucking place is so deep and thick with
this dust shit, seems to act like chaff too. Infrared is giving me
only about twenty feet!] Sava motioned for the team to
move to the right. [Stay close, we move slow and keep the
triggers itchy. The passenger lounges are just east of us. We
start the search there.] The whirs were now all around
them, hovering just outside visual range.
   [What the fuck is that?] A flying insectoid bot with
six articulated arms ending in small buzzsaws lunged
from the dusty darkness at Berk, who dropped to
the floor and unleashed plasma fire into it. The bot
slammed into a pile of bones and rags and set it alight.
The fire spread quickly, leaping from dry cloth to dry
cloth. The blazing hangar floor now illuminated the
area in the hot orange glow of flame. At least a dozen
insectoid bots hovered in a perimeter around the team,
awaiting an opportunity to strike. Another bot dove
at Berk, its buzzsaw arms slashing wildly. Berk fired,
but missed. The bot slammed into Berk’s head and
the buzzsaws ground into her neck. Sparks flew in all
directions as metal met metal. She dropped her rifle
and pushed against the body of the bot till the saws
were off her neck. [Fucking run you idiots! I’ve got this!]
   Sava fired and dropped a bot, then dashed east,
leaping over spreading waist-high flames. [Make for the
lounge!]
   Pivo elevated onto two arms and ran behind Sava,
his five remaining arms flopping wildly above his
head. [Out of the way, ya poke!] Sarlo outpaced the
slower octomorph, running through the flames to-
wards the lounge.
   Berk flung the frenzied bot into a flaming pile of
bones, scrambled to her feet, and followed after the
group, covered in bone bits and dust, the bot swarm
in whirring pursuit.
   Sava reached the lounge first and the portal was open.
Turning with rifle raised, Sava took cover against the
door frame. Sarlo and Pivo were past the flames and
Berk was closing the gap, as were the bots. Sava un-
loaded cover fire that sizzled over Sarlo’s head, knock-
ing another bot out, but the rest of the swarm remained
unphased. They just kept coming. Suddenly, more bots
appeared out of the shrinking darkness near the lounge.
   [There’s more! They’re ﬂanking!] Sava blasted at the
new bots to try and slow down their gambit. Sarlo
was only thirty feet from the portal when he tripped
on a tangle of bones. His boyish body collapsed face
first into the dust and human remains. Pivo made an
awkward leap over him, skidded across the floor, and
squished into the outer lounge wall right near the
door. Sava reached out, snagged the octomorph by a
arm, and dragged him into the safety of the lounge.
Berk tried to stop and help Sarlo up, but her momen-
tum was too much and her footing upon the dusty
floor too unstable. She tumbled forward in a roll of
dust cloud, chipped bone, and tattered rags, finally
slamming into Sava in the doorway.
   The three team members within the lounge gathered
themselves just in time to witness a bot latch onto
Sarlo’s head from above as he stood up. The machine
stretched two arms out to the side, then plunged their
spinning blades into Sarlo’s neck. Sarlo’s eyes went wide
and his body tensed as the saw blades ground through
flesh and bone, working through his neck in seconds.
The instant his head was severed from the torso, the bot
swooped around and zipped off over the flames, into
the dark oblivion of the far end of the hangar.
   Sarlo’s headless body wavered for a second, then
collapsed, spurting blood in long, lazy arcs.




Pivo, Sava, and Berk sat in silence. They had managed
to seal the portal into the lounge, locking out the hor-
rors of the hangar. The headhunter bots could still be
heard hovering outside the portal, occasionally clang-
ing and grinding their blades against the sealed door.
   Berk finally broke the silence. [I’m trying very hard not to
think about what they’re going to do with him.]
   [Try harder. Sarlo knew the odds of survival were slim when
he signed on. We all did.] Sava stood up.
   [Should we tell him? When he resleeves?] Pivo knew this
was going to set Sava off, but he blurted it anyway.
   [Would that be kindness or cruelty, Pivo? And besides,
there is no guarantee that any of us will survive. So who gives
a shit? Whenever your last backup was, I sure hope you’re not
gonna miss anything since. Let’s get moving.]

> ***

With Sarlo gone, Pivo took over the navigation duties.
They were nearing the corporate VIP lounge, the last
known location of the courier.
   The team moved through dark corridors filled with
headless skeletons and mummified remains. Years
ago, the corporate forces defending the structure had
been overrun by AI war machines, which mercilessly
slaughtered everyone inside. The walls were scarred
from battle, covered in dried blood. Destroyed rem-
nants of the AI war machines littered the halls as well,
haunting monuments to the few victories humanity
had in their losing battle. Even as piles of scrap, the
machines had a menacing presence.
   [Too bad this isn’t a salvage op,] Berk commented. [The
autonomists could use a look at this tech. At the very least,
figure out what the hypercorps might try to do with it.]
   As they entered a long concourse, the remains and
debris abruptly disappeared, as if cleared out.
   [I’m getting some strange thermal readings here. Patterns
that don’t make sense,] transmitted Pivo.
   [What is that supposed to mean?] Sava beamed back.
   Before Pivo could give thought to “I don’t know,”
his muse issued a chilling warning: [My nanosensors
register the presence of unknown nanobots in large numbers
of a highly sophisticated design, suggesting a TITAN manu-
facture. Countermeasures have been initiated.]
   [Nanoswarm. Move! Move!] Pivo broadcasted in a
panic as he launched into a full two-armed sprint.
Sava and Berk followed Pivo’s lead without question.
They all knew the dangers of a TITAN nanoswarm.
Unlike the nanobots Pivo often made, which were
manufactured with particular purposes in mind, and
which were neither self-sustaining or intelligent, this
particular nanoswarm was autonomous, self-replicat-
ing, adaptive, and capable of making almost anything
it needed. Even as they fled, individual nanosensors
were measuring up the three agents, transmitting
details on their morphs and gear to the rest of the
swarm.
   A junction came into view ahead, the pathway nar-
rowing into a smaller tunnel. Suddenly, Pivo stopped,
just a meter before the tunnel. [Do not move forward!]
The others crashed to a halt.
   [What the fuck Pivo!?] Sava looked back down the
hall. [Fucking swarm could be finishing us as we speak!]
   [My muse picked up a burst of thermal energy here. The
swarm is up to something,] Pivo warned.
   [But there’s nothing here,] Berk replied, as she
waved her hand across the tunnel entrance. Her
metal hand suddenly clanged to the floor, separated
from her wrist.
   [Monomolecular wire.] Even though the situation grew
more dire by the minute, Pivo was impressed and fas-
cinated with the inventiveness of the alien nanotech.
[It laced the door with it. Cuts through anything. Weak tensile
strength though—you probably snapped it.]
   [We’re fucked. Let’s face it.] Berk picked her severed
hand off the floor. Down the hall, the nanoswarm
began to take a visible shape as the nanobots accreted.
The swarm was congealing into a fog, creeping closer.
Berk continued, [The entirety of this port is probably filled
with this shit. I’m useless at this point. These things are al-
ready all over my systems, my diagnostics are going crazy.]
   [So what are you saying, Berk? You done?] Sava transmitted.
   [Yeah. I’m done.] Berk shook her head in disgust.
[Who knows what these little bastards have infected me with.
I don’t want to risk it. I’d rather resort to a clean back up.
Forget this shit ever happened. You keep running if you want.
I’ll try to buy you some time.] Berk turned and ran di-
rectly into the fog. The nanoswarm sucked in around
her immediately and the disassembly began. Berk’s
metal frame began to dissolve as she ran further and
further away from Pivo and Sava, leaving a wispy trail
of nanoswarm behind her.
   [Get fucking moving fools! This isn’t for my amusement!
I’ll see ya the next time around.] A few minutes later,
Berk’s signal went dead.




Sava and Pivo entered the VIP lounge. When the
spaceport was overrun so many years ago, this was
the site of the humans’ last stand. Piles of security per-
sonnel skeletons littered the floor just inside the door-
way. The charred remnants of a hopeless barricade
were scattered beside the mounds of bone. Skeletons
draped in torn singed civilian garb were clustered
around the walls and corners, sometimes three or four
deep, as if they had all scrambled as far as possible
from some avatar of death in the middle of the room.
   Pivo started an operation to locate the RFID tag
the courier was supposedly chipped with in his left
shoulder blade. The code triggered a ping within three
meters. Pivo pointed a lengthy arm at a small bone
pile. [He’s in there somewhere.]
   Sava stepped over to the pile of three skeletons
and began rummaging through the bones, yanking
out or snapping off all the femurs. [Goddamnit I want
a cigarette. This morph has me so tweaked. Haven’t I made
it clear I don’t smoke? Yet, every time, they sleeve me in a
morph nailed with the habit.] Sava handed the bundle of
bones to Pivo.
   [Must be a fury thing. Should just take a few minutes to
scan these for the nanoscale etching.] Pivo got to work.
[Enough time for a smoke, if you want.]
   [Yeah. Real funny. How about I grind you up into dust and
smoke you?] Sava sat down on the floor as Pivo sent
out a chuckle.
   The deceased courier, whomever he was, had been
entrusted with information too sensitive to transmit.
No one knew the true capabilities of the TITANs to
intercept and decode, so the courier had been injected with nanobots that etched a nanoscopic
encoded message directly onto one of his femur bones. However, he had never made it off the
planet. His message had never been delivered.
   Pivo and Sava had no idea what the information was, but someone at Firewall obviously
deemed it worthy of capture. Information on the TITANs perhaps. Or some CEO’s secret
family recipe for pasta sauce.
   [This is the one.] Pivo held out the femur to Sava and tossed the others to the floor.
   [What does it say?]
   [I don’t know. Not sure I want to know.] Pivo continued to hold out the femur.
   [Enough with the drama Pivo. Just get your nanos to read it. We need a copy of the data. If you don’t want to
carry, I will.]
   [I’d prefer that. Thank you.] Pivo set his nanobots to work on deciphering the inscription. When they
were done, the intel was transmitted directly to Sava. Pivo wanted no part of it.
   [So, now what? How do we get out of here? The only way out is the way we came in, and that’s suicide.]
Pivo’s complexion changed from a milky green to an almost royal blue. It always happened when
helplessness began to settle in.
   Sava did not hesitate to answer, choosing to speak as opposed to transmit. “We’re not gonna
leave, Pivo. Not even gonna try.” Sava raised the plasma rifle and aimed it directly at Pivo’s oblong
head. “See you next time, calamari.” Sava pulled the trigger, and a fiery bolt of plasma reduced
Pivo to a twitching mass of bloody scorched cartilage atop writhing arms. The arms continued to
flop on the floor in a growing pool of blood as Sava sat down next to a pile of bones and leaned
against the wall.
   Sava pulled out a cigarette and lit it. The first inhale was virtually orgasmic. Sava loved to
smoke.
   Upon exhale, Careza pinged. [Shall I contact Project Ozma?]
   Yeah. Get our lady on the line.
   A woman’s voice, cold and harsh, entered Sava’s head, so different from the soothe of
Careza. [Are you prepared to deliver, Agent Sava?]
   [That depends.] Sava took another drag.
   [Perhaps I did not make myself clear during our initial negotiations, Agent Sava. Your
options are rather limited. You are unlikely to make it off the planet alive, and we cannot
afford to lose this information, nor can we afford to have it fall into the hands of your
organization. You are going to have to follow through, and trust that we will do the same.]                           ■
   [Either you give me her location right now, or I take your precious info with me.]
There was a long pause before the woman transmitted again. [You realize there will be conse-
quences, Agent Sava. For you and for Rati.]
   [Yeah. I suppose so.] The cigarette burned to the filter and Sava flicked it into a bone pile. [So what’s
it gonna be?]
   [We do not bargain, Agent Sava, after a deal has been struck. Do as you will, and we will react
accordingly.] The connection with the woman terminated. Sava stood up and walked over to where
the courier’s femur lay and picked it up. Pivo’s gore coated the bone. Sava wiped it off and held it
up to take a close look.
   Sorry, Careza. Info payload only. Leave the ego behind.
   [Understood.]
   With the flash of a thought, Sava instructed Careza to activate the cortical stack’s emergency
farcaster—a one-shot neutrino transmitter, powered by the tiniest amount of antimatter. Sava’s
head exploded all over the room, taking the courier’s femur with it. The information contained on
the femur, however, found its way almost instantly through the blackest depths of space, landing
safely onto a dedicated Firewall receiver elsewhere in the solar system.

   “What’s the number?”
   The words dig their claws into my new vocal cords and yank themselves up and out of my
parched throat. My diction is predictably poor, as it always is during the first few minutes following
a resleeve. The pitch of the voice is apparent despite the mumbled, sandpaper slur of the words.
Definitely a biomorph and my latest sex is female. This much I know in the first few seconds.

# Enter the Singularity

We humans have a special way of pulling ourselves up
and kicking ourselves down at the same time. We’d
achieved more progress than ever before, at the cost
of wrecking our planet and destabilizing our own
governments. But things were starting to look up.
   With exponentially accelerating technologies, we
reached out into the solar system, terraforming worlds
and seeding new life. We re-forged our bodies and
minds, casting off sickness and death. We achieved
immortality through the digitization of our minds,
resleeving from one biological or synthetic body to
the next at will. We uplifted animals and AIs to be our
equals. We acquired the means to build anything we
desired from the molecular level up, so that no one
need want again.
  Yet our race toward extinction was not slowed, and
in fact received a machine-assist over the precipice.
Billions died as our technologies rapidly bloomed into
something beyond control … further transforming
humanity into something else, scattering us through-
out the solar system, and reigniting vicious conflicts.
Nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, nanoswarms,
mass uploads … a thousand horrors nearly wiped
humanity from existence.
   We still survive, divided into a patchwork of restric-
tive inner system hypercorp-backed oligarchies and
libertarian outer system collectivist habitats, tribal
networks, and new experimental societal models. We
have spread to the outer reaches of the solar system
and even gained footholds in the galaxy beyond. But
we are no longer solely “human” … we have evolved
into something simultaneously more and different—
something transhuman.

## Starting out

Eclipse Phase is a post-apocalyptic roleplaying game
of transhuman conspiracy and horror. Humans are
enhanced and improved, but humanity is battered and
bitterly divided. Technology allows the re-shaping of
bodies and minds and liberates us from material needs,
but also creates opportunities for oppression and puts
the capability for mass destruction in the hands of ev-
eryone. Many threats lurk in the devastated habitats of
the Fall, dangers both familiar and alien.

### What is a roleplaying game?

Have you ever read a book or seen a movie or a tele-
vision show where a character does something really
stupid, like heading into a basement at night when the
character knows the serial killer is around? The whole
time, you’re thinking: “I wouldn’t walk down those
creepy stairs to the dark basement, especially without a
flashlight. I’d do X, Y, or Z instead!” Since you’re in the
passenger’s seat for the plot you’re reading or watching,
however, you simply have to sit back and let it unfold.
   What if you could take hold of the driver’s seat?
What if you could take the plot in the direction you’d
choose? That is the essence of a roleplaying game.
   A roleplaying game (or RPG, for short) is part im-
provisational theater, part storytelling, and part game.
A single person (the gamemaster) runs the game for
a group of players that pretend to be characters in a
fictitious world. The world could be a mystery game
set in the 1920s that takes you adventuring around
the globe, a fantasy realm inhabited by dragons
and trolls and sword-wielding barbarians, or a sci-
ence fiction setting with aliens and spaceship and
world-crushing weaponry. The players pick a setting
that they find cool and want to play in. The players
then craft their own characters, providing a detailed
history and personality to bring each to life. These
characters have a set of statistics (numerical values)
that represent skills, attributes, and other abilities.
The gamemaster then explains the situation in which
the characters find themselves. The players, through
their characters, interact with the storyline and each
others’ characters, acting out the plot. As the players
roleplay through some scenarios, the gamemaster will
probably ask a given player to roll some dice and the
resulting numbers will determine the success or failure
of a character’s attempted action. The gamemaster
uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls
and the outcome of the character’s actions.
   As a group exercise, the players control the storyline
(the adventure), which evolves much like any movie or
book but within the flexible plot created by the game-
master. This gamemaster plot provides a framework
and ideas for potential courses of action and outcomes,
but it is simply an outline of what might happen—it
is not concrete until the players become involved. If
you don’t want to walk down those stairs, you don’t.
If you think you can talk yourself out of a situation
in place of pulling a gun, then try and make it happen.
The script of any roleplaying session is written by the
players, and the story, based upon the character’s ac-
tions and their responses to the events of the plot, will
constantly change and evolve.
   The best part is that there is no “right” or “wrong”
way to play an RPG. Some games may involve more
combat and dice rolling-related situations, where other
games may involve more storytelling and improvised
dialogue to resolve a situation. Each group of players
decides for themselves the type and style of game they
enjoy playing!

### What is transhumanism?

Transhumanism is a term used synonymously to
mean “human enhancement.” It is an interna-
tional cultural and intellectual movement that
endorses the use of science and technology to
enhance the human condition, both mentally
and physically. In support of this, transhumanism
also embraces using emerging technologies to
eliminate the undesirable elements of the human
condition such as aging, disabilities, diseases, and
involuntary death. Many transhumanists believe
these technologies will be arriving in our near
future at an exponentially accelerated pace and
work to promote universal access to and demo-
cratic control of such technologies. In the long
scheme of things, transhumanism can also be
considered the transitional period between the
current human condition and an entity so far ad-
vanced in capabilities (both physical and mental
faculties) as to merit the label “posthuman.”
   As a theme, transhumanism embraces heady
questions. What defines human? What does it
mean to defeat death? If minds are software,
where do you draw the line with programming
them? If machines and animals can also be
raised to sentience, what are our responsibilities
to them? If you can copy yourself, where does
“you” end and someone new begin? What are
the potentials of these technologies in terms of
both oppressive control and liberation? How will
these technologies change our society, our cul-
tures, and our lives?

### Post-apocalyptic, conspiracy and horror themes

Several themes pervade Eclipse Phase, some of which
the reader may not be intimately familiar with. The
following helps define these themes so that as play
ers read further into this rulebook, they gain a solid
understanding of how Eclipse Phase builds on such
themes to create its unique setting.
   Post-apocalyptic is a term used to describe fiction
set after a cataclysmic event has ended human civili
zation as we know it (usually accompanied by loss of
human life on an almost unthinkable scale). The exact
mechanism of the disaster is usually unimportant
nuclear war, plague, asteroid strike, and so on. The
importance of the theme is the human condition. If
the world we know is torn away from us and humans
suffer horrors beyond imagining in this transforma
tion to a post-apocalyptic setting, how does human
ity cope? Do we survive and thrive and overcome?
Or do we lose our own humanity in the process, o
ultimately fall to extinction? Those are the questions
that drive this genre.
   To conspire means “to join in a secret agreement
to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such
means to accomplish a lawful end.” As such, a con
spiracy theory attributes the ultimate cause of an
event or a chain of events (whether political, societa
or historical) to a secret group of individuals with
immense power (including political, wealth and so
on) who hide their activities from public view while
manipulating events to achieve their goals, regard
less of consequences. Many conspiracy theories
contend that a host of the greatest events of history
were initiated and ultimately controlled by such
secret organizations. Of equal importance is the
silent struggle between clandestine groups, waging
a secret war behind the scenes to determine who
influences the future.

   Horror takes many forms, but in Eclipse Phase it is
more psychological than gore. It is the uncertainty of
survival, the suspense of finding malevolent things
among the stars, the fear of the unknown, the dread
of facing Things That Should Not Be, the revulsion
when encountering alien things, and the sickening
realization of the wrong and ghastly things that tran-
shumans are capable of doing to themselves and each
other. Horror also arises both from the comprehension
that there are scary things beyond our understanding
 nhabiting our universe and that transhumanity may
be its own worst enemy. Despite all of the technologi-
cal tools and advances available to future transhumans,
they still face terrors like losing control of their own
 dentities, their perceptions, and their mental facul-
ties—not to mention their future as a species.
   Eclipse Phase takes all of these themes and weaves
them together in a transhuman setting. The post-
apocalyptic angle covers the understanding of all
that transhumanity has lost, the fight against extinc-
tion, and how much of that is a struggle against
our own nature. The conspiracy side delves into the
nature of the secret organizations that play key roles
 n determining transhumanity’s future and how the
actions of determined individuals can change the
 ives of many. The horror perspective explores the
results of humanity’s self-inﬂicted transformations
and how some of these changes effectively make us
non-human. Tying it all together is an awareness of
the massive indifference and the terrible alien-ness
that pervades the universe and how transhumanity is
insignificant against such a backdrop.
   Offsetting these themes, however, Eclipse Phase
also asserts that there is still hope, that there is still
something worth fighting for, and that transhuman-
ity can pave its own path toward the future.

### BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PLAY?

To play a game of Eclipse Phase, you need the following:

- A group of players and a place to meet (real life
   or online!)
- One player to act as the gamemaster
- The contents of this book
- Something for everyone to take notes with (note-
   pads, laptops, whatever!)
- Two 10-sided dice per player (or a digital
   equivalent)
- Imagination

#### A GROUP OF PLAYERS AND A PLACE TO MEET

While roleplaying games are flexible enough to allow
any number of people, most gaming groups number
around four to eight players. That number of people
brings a good mix of personalities to the table and
ensures great cooperative play.
   Once a group of players have determined to play
Eclipse Phase, they’ll need to designate someone as
the gamemaster (see below). Then they’ll need to de-
termine a time and place to meet.
   Most roleplaying groups meet once a week at a reg-
ularly scheduled time and place: 7:00 PM, Thursday
night, Rob’s house, for example. However, each group
determines where, how they’ll play, and how often.
One group may decide they can only get together
once a month, while another group is so excited to
dive into the story potential of Eclipse Phase that
they want to meet twice a week (they decide to rotate
between their houses, though, so as not to overload
a particular player). If a group is lucky enough to
have a favorite local gaming store that supports in-
store play, the group might meet there. Other gaming
groups meet in libraries, common rooms at their
school, bookstores that have generously-sized “read-
ing rooms,” quiet restaurants, and so on. Whatever
fits for your gaming group, make it work!
   When getting together for a game, most RPGs
use the phrase “gaming session.” The length of each
gaming session is completely dependent upon the con-
sensus of the playing group, as well as the limitations
of the locale where they’re playing. The particular
story that unfolds in a given session can also impact a
session’s length. If playing in a game store, the group
may only have a four-hour slot and the gamemaster
and group may have determined—through several ses-
sions of play—that this is a perfect time frame to enjoy
the story they’re participating in each week. Another
group, however, may want an even shorter length of
time. Yet another group may decide that while they’ll
usually do four-hour sessions, once a month they’ll
set aside an entire Saturday for a great all-day gaming
session. Players will need to dive in and start play-
ing and be flexible to decide what will provide the
ultimate enjoyment for their gaming group.
   While the camaraderie of a shared experience of
playing face-to-face with a group of friends remains
the strength of roleplaying games, groups need not
confine themselves to a single mode of play. There are
myriad options that can be used. Email, instant mes-
sages, message boards, video chats, phone/voip calls,
text messages, wikis, (micro-)blogs: any and all of
these can be utilized to play the game without having
warm bodies in seats directly across the table from
one another.
   Finally, when playing groups meet for the first time,
they should generate their characters (as opposed to
generating characters by themselves). While a gaming
group can decide to generate characters individually,
often it is far easier once the players are together. This
allows those more experienced in roleplaying games to
help those new to RPGs. Even more important, it en-
ables the entire group to tailor the characters so there
is not too much overlap in capabilities and style. After
all, with the wealth of character opportunities avail-
able, you don’t want to show up at the table with an
almost identical character to the player next to you.

#### THE GAMEMASTER

Once a group has been organized, someone needs to
step up and take the reins of the gamemaster. Some
groups have a single gamemaster that runs all their
gaming sessions month after month. Other groups
rotate a gamemaster, with a single gamemaster run-
ning a given portion of the unfolding story for sev-
eral sessions before handing the work off to another
player. Once again, the participants should be flexible.
Some groups may have the perfect person who loves
the work involved and is more than willing to run
session after session, while other groups may decide
that they all want to take turns both as the gamemas-
ter and as players.
  The gamemaster controls the story. They keep track
of what is supposed to happen when, describes events
as they occur so that the players (as characters) can
react to them, keep track of other characters in the
game (referred to as non-player characters, or NPCs),
and resolve attempts to take action using the game
system. The game system comes into play when char-
acters seek to use their skills or otherwise do some-
thing that requires a test to see whether or not they
succeed. Specific rules are presented for situations that
involve rolling dice to determine the outcome (see
Game Mechanics, p. 112).
  The gamemaster describes the world as the char-
acters see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and other
senses. Gamemastering is not easy, but the thrill of
creating an adventure that engages the other players’
imaginations, testing their gaming skills and their
characters’ skills in the game world, makes it worth-
while. Posthuman Studios and Catalyst Game Labs
will follow the publication of Eclipse Phase with sup-
porting supplements and adventures to help this pro-
cess along, but experienced gamemasters can always
adapt the game universe to suit their own styles. In
fact, since Eclipse Phase is published under a Creative
Commons License (see p. 5), players are encouraged
to tailor the universe to their style of play and also
to share that with other players. You never know
when a specific choice you’ve made in the running of
a campaign is exactly what another gamemaster and
his group is looking for.

#### THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK

Whether you have purchased the print or electronic
version, this book is specifically organized to present
the information you need to know to start telling
your stories in the Eclipse Phase universe. Below
you’ll find a summary of each chapter of the book.
   A Time of Eclipse: A comprehensive history and set-
ting fully describes the Eclipse Phase universe and how
humanity transitioned from here to there. See p. 30.
   Game Mechanics: The player’s desired actions
become reality within the universe through quick and
easy-to-use game mechanics. See p. 112.
   Character Creation and Advancement: Creating a
unique character can be one of the most enjoyable
experiences of roleplaying. Even more rewarding is
watching that character evolve and grow across nu-
merous gaming sessions, far beyond anything your
imagination first envisioned. See p. 128.
   Skills: Beyond a character’s innate abilities, their
skills are what set them apart. This is what your
character knows and what they know how to do. See
p. 170.
   Action and Combat: What is a dramatic story with-
out action and violence? When words fail, weapons
will blaze. See p. 186.
   Mind Hacks: The unusual possibilities offered by
psi abilities and mental reprogramming. See p. 216.
   The Mesh: The all-pervasive nature of the mesh
ensures that it is a key element to any story telling.
See p. 234.
   Accelerated Future: The wonders of advanced tech-
nologies and how they work. See p. 266.
   Gear: Personal enhancements, weapons, robots, and
everything else in between. See p. 294.
   Game Information: The quintessential set of insider
secrets for gamemasters. See p. 350.

#### TAKING NOTES

Whether a gamemaster or player, you’ll need a way to
track information. Players will be generating charac-
ters and making changes to those characters from ses-
sion to session. Meanwhile, the gamemaster will have
a host of information to track: notes on how the story
is unfolding due to player character interaction that
you’ll need to fold into next week’s session; changes
to NPCs; changes to player characters that the players
are not yet aware off (such as a character has been
mind hacked but doesn’t yet know it); and so on.
   Additionally, some groups enjoy a synopsis of
each session that can be compiled and read at a
later time in order to enjoy and share their exploits,
just as you might fileshare clips from your favorite
video game to show off your skill in taking the
bad guy down (traditionally this has been called
“bluebooking”). This can be particularly useful if a
player was unable to attend a given session, pro-
viding a quick re-cap that they can read before at-
tending the next gaming session and thus avoiding
a bog-down up-front as that player tries to catch
up on current events in the game. The session scribe
can be a shared responsibility or assigned, all based
upon what a given playing group finds works best
for them. Likewise, some gaming groups audio-
record their entire game session, both for later
reference and for “actual play” podcasts.
  The old standard of a pencil and paper still works
wonders. A host of additional technologies, how-
ever, provide many new options for players. From
a text file on a laptop to a shared wiki, the ability
to track large amounts of information in a quick
and useful fashion—while simultaneously making
appropriate information available to each player
from session to session—significantly decreases
how much time everyone needs to spend tracking
information. That time can now be redirected into
the enjoyment of participating in a great story.

#### DICE

As described in the Game Mechanics section (p. 112),
two ten-sided dice are required to play Eclipse Phase.
While most players enjoy the feel of tossing dice onto
a table, there are many other mechanisms for rolling
two ten-sided dice to achieve a 00 to 99 result. Players
who make heavy use of any online technologies for
game play—such as using online chatting or video
blogging—should find it easy to track down and
implement a quick dice-rolling program.

#### IMAGINATION

All too often, it’s easy for someone looking at an
RPG to be intimidated. So many concepts to grasp,
so many ideas that seem overwhelming. Just as de-
scribed under What is a Roleplaying Game?, how-
ever, how often have you read a book or watched
that movie and decided that you would have done
it better? That’s your imagination at work. Just dive
in and you’ll be amazed at how quickly you can im-
merse yourself in the Eclipse Phase universe. Soon
you’ll be spinning stories with the best of them.
   Also, don’t forget to tap your resources. Your
gaming group is your best resource. What’s going on,
ideas for how to handle a situation, or how to take
on a bad guy: these are just some of the things that
can and should be discussed by the gaming group
in between sessions, and each is an opportunity to
strengthen your imagination.
   Another resource is simply watching TV or read-
ing a good book. Pay attention to how the story is
put together, how the characters are built, and how
the plot unfolds. Push your imagination and soon
you’ll be figuring out subplots and who the bad guy
is long before it’s revealed. Knowing how a story is
put together enables you to put together your own
stories during each gaming session.
   Finally, eclipsephase.com is the offi cial site for
Eclipse Phase. If you have questions about the
game or want to see how another group of players
handles a given situation, post on the forums. The
online community can be just as helpful and enjoy-
able as a local gaming group.

### WHAT DO PLAYERS DO?

The players can take on a variety of roles in Eclipse
Phase. Due to advances in digital mind emulation
technology, uploading, and downloading into new
morphs (physical bodies, biological or synthetic), it is
possible to literally be a new person from session to
session. With bodies taking on the role of gear, players
can customize their forms for the task at hand.

#### THE DEFAULT CAMPAIGN

In the default story (also known as “campaign set-
ting”), every player character is a “sentinel,” an
agent-on-call (or potential recruit) for a shadowy
network known as “Firewall.” Firewall is dedicated
to counteracting “existential risks”—threats to the
existence of transhumanity. These risks can and do
include biowar plagues, nanotech swarm outbreaks,
nuclear proliferation, terrorists with WMDs, net-
breaking computer attacks, rogue AIs, alien en-
counters, and so on. Firewall isn’t content to simply
counteract these threats as they arise, of course,
so characters may also be sent on information-
gathering missions or to put in place pre-emptive
or failsafe measures. Characters may be tasked to
investigate seemingly innocuous people and places
(who turn out not to be), make deals with shady
criminal networks (who turn out not to be trustwor-
thy), or travel through a Pandora’s Gate wormhole
to analyze the relics of some alien ruin (and see if
the threat that killed them is still real). Sentinels
are recruited from every faction of transhumanity;
those who aren’t ideologically loyal to the cause are
hired as mercenaries. These campaigns tend to mix
a bit of mystery and investigation with fierce bouts
of action and combat, also stirring in a nice dose of
awe and horror.

#### ALTERNATE CAMPAIGNS

When they’re not saving the solar system, sentinels are
free to pursue their own endeavors. The gamemaster
and players can use this rulebook to generate any
type of story they wish to tell. However, the following
examples provide a brief look at the most obvious op-
portunities for adventure in Eclipse Phase.
   After each campaign variant below, a list of “ar-
chetypes” for Eclipse Phase are provided in paren-
thesis. Archetypes are the names applied to the most
common character types featured in those scenarios.
For example, in a traditional detective story, the ar-
chetypes would be the Detective, the Damsel In Dis-
tress, the Hard-bitten Cop, and so on. In a cowboy
movie, the archetypes would be the Gunfighter, the
Bartender, the Marshal, the Indian Brave, and so
on. Players will note that some archetypes fit into
multiple story settings. The character creation system
(p. 128) allows players to create any of the suggested
archetypes. Just as roleplaying games are designed
for players to build their own stories, however, these
archetypes are just suggestions and players can mix
and match how they will.
   Salvage and Rescue/Retrieval Ops: The Fall left
two worlds and numerous habitats in ruins—but
these devastated cities and stations contain untold
riches for those who are brave and foolhardy
enough. Potential hauls include: weapon systems;
physical resources; lost databanks; left-behind up-
loads of friends, family, or important people; new
technologies developed and lost in the brief singular-
ity takeoff; valued heirlooms of immortal oligarchs;
and much more. Outside of these once-inhabited
realms, space itself is a big place and lots of people
and things get lost out there. Some need to be saved
and some are beyond saving. This option lets players
explore the unknown or seek out specific targets on
contract. (Archeologist/Scavenger/Pirate/Free Trader/
Smuggler/Black Marketeer)
   Exploration: There are plenty of opportunities
to be had as an explorer, colonist, or long-range
scout—perhaps even as one of the few lucky or sui-
cidal individuals who explore through an untested
Pandora’s Gate. Even the Kuiper Belt, on the fringe
of our solar system, is still sparsely explored; there
may be riches and mysteries still to be found. Many
dangers also lurk in odd corners of the system, from
isolationist posthuman factions to secretive criminal
cartels, as well as pirates, aliens, and others wish-
ing to remain out of sight. (Explorer/Archeologist/
Scavenger/Singularity Seeker/Techie/Medic)
   Trade: While the majority of inner system trade is
controlled by sleek hypercorporations, many of the
smaller or more independent stations rely on small
traders. In the post-scarcity outer system, trade takes
on a different form, with information, favors, and
creativity serving as currency among those who no
longer want for anything due to the availability of
cornucopia machines. (Free Trader/Smuggler/Black
Marketeer/Pirate)
   Crime: The patchwork of city-state habitats and
widely varying laws throughout the system create
ample opportunity for those who would make a
living from this situation. Black market commodi-
ties and activities include infomorph-slave trading,
pleasure pod sex industries, data brokerage and
theft, extracting/smuggling advanced technologies
and scientists, political/economic espionage, assas-
sination, drug and XP dealing, soul-trading, and
much more. Whether as an independent or part of
an organized criminal element, there are always op-
portunities for those with a thirst for adventure or
profit and questionable morals. (Criminal/Smuggler/
Pirate/Fixer/Black Marketeer/Genehacker/Hacker/
Covert Ops)
   Mercenaries: The constant maneuvering of ideolog-
ically-driven factions, the squabbling over contested
resources, and the rush to colonize new exoplanets
beyond the Pandora Gates all spark new conflicts on
a regular basis. Some of these simmer and seeth as
low-intensity conflicts for years, occasionally flaring
into raids and clashes. Others break out into all-out
warfare. Women and men willing to bear arms for
credits are always in demand for good wages. Play-
ers can engage in commando and military campaigns
in habitats, between the stars, or in hostile planetary
environments. (Merc/Security Specialist/Fixer/Bounty
Hunter/Ex-Cop/Medic)
   Socio-Political Intrigue: The corporations and
political factions that span the solar system do not
always play nice with each other, but neither is it
wise for them to openly confront each other except
under extreme circumstances. Many battles are
fought with diplomacy and political maneuvering,
using words and ideas more potent than weapons.
Even within factions, social cliques can compete
ruthlessly, or heated class confl icts can come to
a boil, tearing a society apart from within. In this
campaign, the players can start as pawns of some
entity who rise through the ranks as they become
more enmeshed in the intrigues of their sponsor, play
a group of ambassadors and spies stationed in the
opposition’s capital, or can play a group of activ-
ists and radicals fighting for social change. (Politico/
Socialite/Covert Ops/Hacker/Security Specialist/
Journalist/Memeticist)

### WHERE DOES IT TAKE PLACE?

While Eclipse Phase is set in the not-too-distant
future, the changes that have taken place due to the
advancements of technology have transformed the
Earth and its inhabitants almost beyond recognition.
As players dive into the universe, they’ll generally
encounter one of the following settings.

#### HUMANITY’S HABITATS

The Earth has been left an ecologically-devastated
ruin, but humanity has taken to the stars. When
Earth was abandoned, so too were the last of the
great nation-states; transhumanity now lacks
a single unifying governing body and is instead
subject to the laws and regulations of whomever
controls a given habitat.
  The majority of transhumanity is confined to
orbital habitats or satellite stations scattered
throughout the Sol system. Some of these were
constructed from scratch in the orbit or Lagrange
points of planetary bodies, others have been hewn
out of solid satellites and large asteroids. These sta-
tions have myriad purposes from trade to warfare,
espionage to research.
  Mars continues to be one of transhumanity’s
largest settlements, though it too, suffered heavily
during the Fall. Numerous cities and settlements
remain, however, though the planet is only partially
terraformed. Venus, Luna, and Titan are also home
to significant populations. Additionally, there are a
small number of colonies that have been established
on exoplanets (on the other side of the Pandora
Gates) with environments that are not too hostile
towards humanity.
   Some transhumans prefer to live on large colony
ships or linked swarms of smaller spacecraft, moving
nomadically. Some of these rovers intentionally exile
themselves to the far limits of the solar system, far
from everyone else, while others actively trade from
habitat to habitat, station to station, serving as
mobile black markets.

#### THE GREAT UNKNOWN

The areas of the galaxy that have felt the touch of
humanity are few and far between. Lying betwixt
these occasional outposts of questionable civilization
are mysteries both dangerous and wonderful. Ever
since the discovery of the Pandora Gates, there has
been no shortage of adventurers brave or foolhardy
enough to strike out on their own into the unknown
regions of space in hopes of finding more alien ar-
tifacts, or even establishing contact with one of the
other sentient races in the universe.

#### THE MESH

While not a “setting” in the traditional sense, as
the sections describe above, the computer net-
works known as the “mesh” are all-pervasive. This
ubiquitous computing environment is made pos-
sible thanks to advanced computer technologies and
nanofabrication that allow unlimited data storage
and near-instantaneous transmission capacities. With
micro-scale, cheap-to-produce wireless transceivers so
abundant, literally everything is wirelessly connected
and online. Via implants or small personal comput-
ers, characters have access to archives of information
that dwarf the entire 21st-century internet and sensor
systems that pervade every public place. People’s
entire lives are recorded and lifelogged, shared with
others on one of numerous social networks that link
everyone together in a web of contacts, favors, and
reputation systems.

### EGO VS. MORPH

The distinction between ego (your mind and per-
sonality, including memories, knowledge, and skills)
and morph (your physical body and its capabilities)
is one of the defi ning characteristics of Eclipse
Phase. A good understanding of the concept right
up front will allow players a glimpse at all the story
possibilities out of the gate.
  Your body is disposable. If it gets old, sick, or too
heavily damaged, you can digitize your conscious-
ness and download it into a new one. The process
isn’t cheap or easy, but it does guarantee you ef-
fective immortality—as long as you remember to
back yourself up and don’t go insane. The term
morph is used to describe any type of form your
mind inhabits, whether a vat-grown clone sleeve,
a synthetic robotic shell, a part-bio/part-synthetic
“pod,” or even the purely electronic software state
of an infomorph.
  A character’s morph may die, but the character’s
ego may live on, assuming appropriate backup
measures have been taken. Morphs are expendable,
but your character’s ego represents the ongoing,
continuous life path of your character’s mind and
personality. This continuity may be interrupted by
an unexpected death (depending on how recently
the backup was made), but it represents the totality
of the character’s mental state and experiences.
   Some aspects of your character—particularly skills,
along with some stats and traits—belong to your
character’s ego and so stay with them throughout
the character’s development. Some stats and traits,
however, are determined by morph, as noted, and so
will change if your character leaves one body and
takes on another. Morphs may also affect other skills
and stats, as detailed in the morph description.

### WHERE TO GO FROM HERE?

Now that you know what this game is about, we sug-
gest that you next read the Time of Eclipse chapter
(p.  30), to get a feel for the game’s default setting
(which you are, of course, free to change to suit your
whims). Then read the Game Mechanics chapter
(p. 112) to get a grasp of the rules. After that, you
can move on to Character Creation and Advancement
(p. 128) and create your first character!

### TERMINOLOGY

Eclipse Phase uses a host of jargon to simply convey
the numerous concepts covered within the pages of
this book. While not all-inclusive, this list of terminol-
ogy will allow players to quickly acclimate themselves
for their journey into Eclipse Phase. If you read some-
thing and are confused, don’t worry. These concepts
are fully explained in later sections of this book.
  Note that several of the words on this list are
standard scientific terms, often used in astronomy. As
Eclipse Phase attempts to remain as close to “hard sci-
ence” as possible—while allowing players to interact
with the great stories waiting to unfold—such terms
are used liberally.

A PEOPLE’S HISTORY OF AN UNFORTUNATE UNIVERSE

[Sounds of scratching on the microphone, creaking of
furniture, the noise of a woman clearing her throat]
   What?
   [Indistinct murmuring]
   Fuck you. I do this how the fuck I want, though
it was nice of you to put me in this nice young
woman’s body.
   [Sounds of hands running along fabric]
   Does my vulgarity shock you, corporate lackey? No
matter, I’m sure you can edit it out for your proles.
Now—you asked about my book? Is it a history book
you ask? No. It is an anti-history book. I shall tell you
about the future.
   [Mumbling, questioning tone]
   What does it hold? The future, you mean?
   [Indistinct “Yes.”]
   No. I don’t think you care about the future. What
you really want to know is: will you get the future
you want? And that is an easy question to answer. No.
No, you will not get the future you want. Because you
are stupid enough to ask this stupid question about
the future.
   [Silent pause]
   I remember reading a scan of an old real print
comic once. The character in it was railing against
the imaginary people of his imaginary world, taking
them to task about their dissatisfaction with the
future they lived in. But it was really aimed at the
stupid people who wanted their stupid little futures
and who were too stupid to see that the future is
now. It’s always now. Except it isn’t anymore. The
TITANs changed that. The future is now yesterday,
and last week, and ten years ago. Especially ten
years ago. But the future is also back on poor old
Earth—it’s a legacy of where we’ve been and what
has come before.

   Do they teach you history on Venus, in your sealed
compounds and resort aerostats? No, don’t open
your mouth, I could really care less what they teach
you. For it is most certainly lies. I’ve lived in the inner
system. I know the rules and the deceits told in the
name of civil order and “national security.”
   Nations! Ha! Even at the onset of the 21st century,
nations were starting to go into decline. It just took
everyone a while to realize they were obsolete.
   Do you remember the great nations of the world?
Are you old enough to remember how they sat around
and debated whether the major climate shifts they
were creating were even real? Even when many of
them agreed that something needed to be done, none
of them stood up to do it. The leaders of the world
carried on with business as usual, secure in their
privilege, as droughts ravaged Africa and Central
Asia, Europe froze, and severe weather wreaked havoc
everywhere. People across the globe were feeling the
pinch of starvation or rampant epidemics, but the
leading nations were more concerned about the refu-
gees pouring over their borders and polluting their lily
white paradises with their customs and languages and
willingness to work for a pittance just to survive.
   The wars over oil and energy were only worsened
by wars over the weather and water that followed.
Unstable regimes rose and fell or were pushed over
the edge, all in pursuit of precious liquids. The great
nation states transformed into fortresses, steeled
against the twin threats of the barbarians threatening
them on the outside and the masses of their poor and
dispossessed internally, all of them wanting to come
in only for a little drink.
   You know, I’ve actually heard some conservatives
refer to that period as a golden age, a peak time for
the corporations and the rich. It’s certainly true that
it was a golden age for repression—and profits. If you
were in that lucky fraction of a percent of the popula-
tion who could afford it, it was certainly a good time,
but for the majority of humanity it was a time of hor-
rors. Global inequality was larger than ever before.
Robots were taking jobs away from human hands.
   This was a time of radicalization for many. Failing
governments no longer supplied people’s basic needs.
The globalized poor turned to local tribes, fundamen-
talist groups, political radicals, and criminal networks
for the means to survive. Insurgent groups flourished,
but they depended on the black market to survive,
and soon their leaders were more concerned with
making money than making change.
   The nation states, as always, resorted to repres-
sion. Civil liberties were restricted and surveillance
increased. Automated weapons systems were de-
ployed first against guerrillas and terror cells, and
then against agitators and demonstrators. I remem-
ber the first time I saw those police drones, at a
demonstration in support of a worker’s strike in Long
Beach. The drones ordered us to disperse once, only
once, before they opened fire with their “nonlethal”
weapons. Nonlethal my ass. Three people died that
day and dozens were injured. The mainstream media
ignored it even if the bloggers didn’t.
   Meanwhile, the privileged elites continued to pros-
per. Longevity treatments expanded lifespans—for
those who could afford it. Major crackdowns swept
up off-brand pharma and bootleg procedures by
pioneering biochemists, even while worldwide life ex-
pectancies dropped for the first time in decades. Why
extend the lives of so many poor people, when expert
systems as smart as any human could be built in a
fraction of the time it would take to educate an actual
person, and robotics and drone technologies allowed
menial jobs to be turned over to uncomplaining and
unpaid labor. And the rich had their high-pricetag
designer chimeric pets to keep them company anyway.
   Not all of the upper classes were wallowing in
opulence while the planet around them starved and
drowned. A few were looking ahead at the changes on
the horizon, scheming how to stake their claim. Some
of these worked to expand their dominion, building
a space elevator in sub-Saharan Africa and sending
robotic probes out to map the solar system in detail.
They even founded the first stations on Mars and
Luna then, more than fifty years before the Fall.
   The ecopocalypse wasn’t going away, however, no
matter how much those in power tried to ignore it.
Severe winters and draughts continued to pound at us.
Rising ocean levels devastated coastlines worldwide
with massive flooding. A few last-ditch efforts to un-
dertake mega-scale geoengineering projects created as
many problems as they fixed. These were viewed with
cynicism anyway, as some were thinly-disguised test
runs for terraforming techniques being prepared for
off-world deployment.
   It often seemed as though the eyes of the fortunate
were no longer focused on the world around them,
but rather on the heavens above them. The comple-
tion of the first space elevator and the first mass driver
on our moon kicked off a new space race and the
competition was on to stake claims around the solar
system. All this new expansion was powered by the
first mass-produced efficient fusion power plants and
the establishment of Helium-3 mining enterprises.
   Back on Earth, though, the hammer finally fell. In-
surgents adopted fifth generation warfare techniques,
sharing open source methods of resistance, utilizing
swarming attacks on critical systempunkts. People
crushed under years of oppression rose up in these
opportunities and smashed at the state and corporate
apparatus that had held them down. Nation after
nation fell to insurgencies manned by those who had
fought in thousands of little wars over fuel, ponds,
and bread crusts.
   Most states fought back by becoming more totali-
tarian and repressive, but the tide of rebellion spread
off world as a series of outposts and stations declared
themselves in sympathy with their earthbound com-
patriots and announced a manifesto for a more hu-
manistic approach to solar expansion. Even numerous
scientists and engineers, who had previously worked
as pawns in corporate expansions, adopted a techno-
progressive stance. That’s how the argonauts were
born, you know, taking their name from a previous
group of scientists who advised the US government
and Pentagon on science and policy called the Jasons.
Faced with reprisals from their corporate masters, a
number of argonauts defected from the hypercorps,
in some cases taking key resources and research with
them, while others went underground.
   This is when the hypercorps really took off, though,
those shark-like bastards. They let the nation-states
and lumbering multinationals of old take the brunt
of the global rage and assault. They took advantage
of the chaos to slip free of the old moral and ethical
restraints on human experimentation and from the
legal purview of the nationalities that had birthed
them. They embraced the opportunities of numerous
new technologies and the drive into space. It was their
research labs that cooked up the first sentient artificial
intelligences, the first genegineered human clones, and
the first true uplifts, chimps and dolphins brought
into awareness as corporate experiments and slaves.
  As the last of the old states became increasingly
desperate to cling to their power and land, the hy-
percorps extended a helping hand. They offered debt
bondage terms to those who were willing to sign over
their rights and humanity for a trip off world, to work
as indentured servants on corporate colonies and sta-
tions. Hundreds of thousands took the offer as an al-
ternative to the crushing poverty and chaos on Earth.
The business of resource exploitation exploded across
the solar system, as stations were established as far
out as the Kuiper Belt. Voices that spoke of respecting
biodiversity and natural ecologies were ignored as
the hypercorps toiled to reshape various planets and
moons to their will.
   This was the state of things until about 20 years
before the Fall. Though many of the old oppressor
states had been struck down, new ones arose, and
the various global insurgencies oscillated between
making radical changes and falling into the same
old tribal warfare traps. Reactionary religious and
political forces on Earth also railed against the hyper-
corps’ agenda, resulting in some terrorist attacks and
sabotage strikes, and culminating in a failed attempt
to disable the space elevator by an Islamist suicide
cell. The hypercorps were quick to retaliate, ordering
an orbital bombardment using high-density objects
against the headquarters and compounds of several
key opposition leaders. Though effective in decapitat-
ing several terrorist networks, the mass destruction
sparked outrage against the hypercorps, creating a
deeper rift between Earth and off-world interests.
   The hypercorps remained out of reach, how-
ever, though they were not completely immune from
Earth’s troubles. The workers and colonists brought
from Earth transported many of their ethnic, political,
and socio-tribal grudges with them, leading to several
outbreaks of violence in habitats and orbital stations.
Some also harbored allegiances opposed to hypercorp
interests, illustrated by isolated acts of preservation-
ist sabotage and religious terrorist attacks. Various
criminal networks also came along for the ride, ex-
panding their black markets and vice trades wherever
humans went.
   As the hypercorps expanded, so too did their po-
litical opponents: the anarchists, socialists, argonauts
and others who worked diligently to establish their
own independent presence, mostly in the outer system,
further from hypercorp reach. The hypercorps even
contributed to this growth by sending their criminals
and undesirable elements into exile beyond Mars.
   Both sides invested heavily in research and new
technologies. Advances in biotech, nanotech, AI, and
cognitive science were now moving so rapidly that
major breakthroughs were made on a yearly basis.
Developments in one field created a recursive boost
in the others, creating a feedback loop that spawned
immense technological improvements. Off-world,
genetic modifications were widely adopted, and new
transhuman adaptations became a common sight. We
even created new synthetic life forms that were part
biological and part robotic. Despite some being so
repulsed by this development that they dubbed these
new types of beings “pod people,” it certainly didn’t
stop pods from being rapidly absorbed into corporate
workforces and brothels, nor did many people care
enough to support claims that, as sapient beings, pods
should have their own civil rights.
   Two breakthroughs in this period deserve spe-
cific mention, not least because of their impact on our
human—now transhuman—society. The development
of the first nanotech assemblers signaled a paradigm
shift for economics. Available only to the upper
strata of the hypercorps at first, these elites jealously
guarded these machines, capable of building almost
anything from the atoms up. They placed all sorts of
restrictions on their usage and availability, claiming
that the capability to construct drugs, weapons, or
other restricted items was a security risk that required
them to be strictly controlled. Open source advocates
promptly set to work undermining blueprint controls
and seeding their own open source designs, of course.
Likewise, within months, criminals and anarchists
liberated their own assemblers, and suddenly an eco-
nomic conflict was born. Some were put to use feed-
ing the black market trade, while others were used
to establish habitats and colonies with post-scarcity
economies that no longer relied on wealth, property,
or greed.
   At the same time came the ability to map the
human brain and digitally emulate the mind and
memories, making “uploading” possible—followed
closely by the ability to download back into a sepa-
rate human brain of course. The already long-lived
hypercorp masters no longer had to fear death by
accident or injury. This technology also made its way
into the hands of others, despite the costs. Experi-
mentation with other bodies—both biological and
synthetic—became a new playground for culture.
And let’s not forget those who willingly shook off the
shackles of the flesh to experience the virtual life and
dive deep into their own dreamscape realities.
   While we all enjoyed our new toys, though, Earth,
poor Earth, continued to die a slow death. I can still
recall the speculation that it might take centuries for
the Earth to totally slide into ecological devastation. It
was frustrating, everywhere you turned it seemed that
someone was lamenting the state of the motherworld,
but no one wanted to do anything. It was too expen-
sive, or too far away, or too dangerous. We all have
blood on our hands from that time. We stood by and
watched from our places in orbit as the world burned
around our brothers and sisters. We thought we had
time, we thought the world was slowly dying and that
we could find the cure. We didn’t plan on the TITANs.
   We all remember the Fall. It was only ten years
ago, but I never cease to be amazed at how confused
people’s memories are of that time. Part of that is
propaganda perpetuated by people like you, of course,
and part of it is that most of us are afraid to really
look back and examine how we humans managed to
fuck it up so badly.
   We like to pretend that the TITANs exploded on
the scene, wrecked up the place, and then disappeared
as quickly as they appeared. The truth, as always, is
more complex. We claim to know that the TITANs
somehow evolved by accident from a military netwar
system, or so the theory goes. That is what their name
means: an acronym for Total Information Tactical
Awareness Networks. No one knows for sure where
these first seed AIs came from, though—or if they do,
they’re keeping quiet. Perhaps the TITANs were inten-
tionally designed to be a recursively improving, self-
aware digital intelligence. Perhaps the military boffins
thought they could keep such an intelligence under
their control, and that it would give them the edge
they needed. Perhaps there was only one at first, and
it quickly created hundreds if not thousands of copies
of itself. No one even seems to know how many of
them there were.
   According to the written history—vetted by the hy-
percorps natch—we now know that the TITANs took
several days after they “woke up” to scan the world
around them, to learn about us. In their initial stage
they were relatively benign, leeching network power
and resources only where there was enough to spare
and extending their senses beyond their cradle on
Earth. Perhaps they were absorbing everything they
could to understand us. Perhaps they were indifferent.
Or maybe they really were planning to destroy us, as
the vids all say.
   I remember this time. I remember that when this
new round of conflicts re-ignited on Earth, there
was no word of anything about seed AIs or TITANs.
For months and months, it was a simple escalation
of hostilities. It started with claims of netwar opera-
tions and major intrusions, sparking some alarm and
retaliatory attacks. Aggressive stances led to incrimi-
nations, then border conflicts and raids, followed by
missile strikes and outright hostilities. Old grudges
and sleeping enemies suddenly awoke and turned
their renewed wrath against old foes. Brush wars,
corporate rivalries, and ideological disputes flared up
as insurgencies and rebellions were suddenly every-
where. At the time, it seemed like a not-so-unusual
spate of violence had taken a drastic turn and was
rapidly spiraling out of control.
   According to the party line, this was all a carefully-
concerted effort, the first stage in the TITANs plans.
Perhaps it was, though I remember some military of-
ficials once claiming that the TITANs were brought
online because of this violence, and not before then—
an opinion that was quickly silenced. Then again,
maybe we really were played—played by greater in-
telligences who could barely be bothered to deal with
us themselves when they knew we were more than
willing to murder and annihilate each other.
   When the first reports of strange automatic facto-
ries cranking out large numbers of robotic weapons
systems broke, no one knew who to blame, but clearly
something was wrong. This was a turning point, a
chance for humanity to realize that we collectively
faced a new enemy, but the finger-pointing and direct
conflict continued. Even when the first open attacks
by the TITANs came in earnest, crashing major sys-
tems, taking control of critical infrastructures, and
wreaking havoc and destruction, we treated it as a
new front in the war, and never stopped taking shots
at each other.
   There is still debate over whether we should have
tried to talk to the TITANs, whether they would have
been willing to listen to us, whether they even saw us
as something more than we see rats and roaches and
other forms of vermin. But it’s all academic. The fact
is we didn’t. The people who made the decisions, the
ones who had to put it all on the line at the time, saw
the TITANs as a threat. And they acted accordingly,
trying to purge them from their systems or capture
them for future study.
   The philosopher Thomas Hobbes once spoke of the
war of all against all. Whatever he imagined could not
have been anything close to the conflict ignited by the
TITANs. We killed ourselves by the millions, wield-
ing the nuclear fire and the silent death of bioplagues
indiscriminately. Among this carnage walked the
TITANs, taking control of our machines as though
we were children, harvesting millions of minds with
forced uploads for unknown purposes. Every strike
we launched against the TITANs was met with untold
disaster and ruin, all our artifice and devices turned
against us in our moment of need.
   The Fall was a horror. Factories sprang up like a
blight in the most ravaged and deserted places on
Earth, pumping out legions of dread war machines.
Advanced nanoswarms—far beyond our own capa-
bilities—infested everywhere, mutating to deal with
any threat they encountered. Biological nanovirii
ripped through human populations, inflicting irre-
versible neurological damage. Potent infowar worms
penetrated even hardened systems, shredding our
crucial networks with ease. Prisoner populations were
rounded up for forced mind emulations, suffering a
luckier fate than those who were merely decapitated
by head-collecting drones or pierced by robots with
neuro-scanning proboscises. Neuropathic virii turned
some humans into pawns of the TITANs, turning
them against the rest of us. Other reports spoke of
strange, alien happenings and unimaginable terrors.
We found ourselves fighting a rearguard action against
coming extinction. The plot of a hundred novels and
movies made manifest in our lifetimes, the doom of
transhumanity at the hands of the machines.
   For over a year they stalked and destroyed us.
There seemed to be no hurry on their part to bring us
to an end, and why would there have been? Nothing
we did affected them. They were data and information,
they were thought and impulse, they were everywhere
and nowhere, and there was nothing we could do that
they could not turn back against us. Their influence
spread outward from Earth, with outbreaks in orbit,
on Luna, Mars, and many other places. Everywhere
we had a foothold, the TITANs followed.
   Perhaps you remember that point when it became
clear that transhumanity might not survive. I do. Mil-
lions must have seen the signs. And so the great dias-
pora began, the teeming masses doing whatever they
could to flee Earth. Ships were diverted, even built, to
help people escape. Those who could not buy their
way off the planet did their best to send their digital
backups, in the dim hope they could acquire a new
body. Perhaps one in ten escaped.
   You might hear that we banded together to stop
the threat, that in our darkest hour we forgave an-
cient grudges and simmering hatreds in the face of
extinction. That would be a lie in the face of the ten
thousand shot down over Buenos Aires by North
American forces as they sought to escape, or the
compromising of network security on over two dozen
habitats in Lagrange orbits by corporate competitors
as their rivals strove to fight off a TITANs attack. We
were just as gleeful to destroy ourselves.
   Then, as quickly as they appeared, the TITANs
vanished. Over the course of a week, the attacks and
disturbances trailed off and then stopped but for an
occasional outbreak. The retributions and attacks by
our own kind continued for a few more months, but
the damage we did to ourselves was nothing com-
pared to what the TITANs had done.
   In the aftermath, we stood among the smoking
ruins of transhumanity and surveyed all that had
been lost. Of all the billions that existed before
the Fall, fewer than one in every eight survived,
and of those fewer still retained a corporeal form.
Nevertheless, the surviving habitats and stations
were overcrowded, with tensions high. Vast numbers
of infugees circulated in storage, as there were simply
not enough bodies on hand to accommodate them
all. Some were placed in permanent storage, where
they remain forgotten. Others were shunted into
virtual reality, given no choice but to live their lives
in simulated environments. A lucky few were given
the chance to work as indentured servants, often
to build new habitats, working on the promise of a
body of their own someday. You’ve no doubt seen
them, working in cheap mass produced synthmorph
bodies in menial or dangerous tasks kept out of sight
of the rest of us.
   Those left dead or bereft of a body were the least
of our problems. Our war with the TITANs had left
the Earth a smoking, irradiated, toxic wasteland, still
populated by dangerous machines and plagues. The
newly formed Planetary Consortium, composed of
hypercorp interests among the Martian and Lunar
colonies, placed Earth and the space around it under
quarantine. The official reason is that it’s for safety
reasons, allegedly to keep any remaining threats from
escaping Earth’s confines. Or perhaps we could not
stand to look at our homeworld in such a state and
face what we had done to ourselves.
   Even now, ten years later, we are told that the Earth
is dangerous, that it holds risks and surprises. That’s
partly true, I believe—there are surprises alright, but
the Planetary Consortium wants them all for itself.
   [Rustling noises, murmurs]
   Of course I’m talking about a Pandora Gate. The
one the TITANs left behind on Saturn’s moon was
just the first. You’re a fool if you think that there are
only five in the entire system. I’d be willing to bet
nearly anything that there’s one down there on dear
old Earth.
   Have you ever seen a Gate? No? Of course not.
The hypercorps keep them locked down. Not like out
in the wild, wild outer system. Sure, the Gatekeeper
Corp lets anyone with a death wish and the minimum
training take a jaunt through the original on Pandora,
but if you’re lucky enough to come back, they own
everything you find on the other side. I suppose it’s
the chance for a certain type of adrenaline junkie “to
boldly go” and all that nonsense.
   The extrasolar colonies—now, those are an all new
frontier. You inner system types are so predictable
with your rush to colonize and expand and own
everything, as if the universe is just there for your
rich overlords to claim for themselves. I expect your
extrasolar colonies are expanding quite nicely, given
the sheer number of poor debt-conscripted souls you
toss through. You probably have grand schemes of
building galactic empires. Us. Transhumanity. A ga-
lactic civilization.
   Well, galactic squatters at least. That was made
clear when the solemn crossing guards of the cosmos
showed up and issued us a warning that we were
dabbling in Things What Ought Not To Have Been.

Maybe the Factors are telling us the truth, maybe they
are acting as ambassadors for a collection of space-
faring alien species that want to warn us away from
Forbidden Technology—y’know, the technology we’ve
already been burned by and of course have no plans
to actually abandon. Think about the Two Com-
mandments they have given us: thou shalt not create
self-improving AI, and thou shalt not use the Pandora
Gates. Oops. Do you think they know? About what
happened with the TITANs? That even we don’t know
where they went and that we’re kind of afraid to find
out? Surely they know that we’ve been using the gates
and have spread beyond our little backwater, and
maybe that’s their real fear. But why do we even listen
to what some highly-evolved slime mold tells us to
do anyway?
   Taking risks, that’s the price of progress, no? Let’s
face it, we need some hope. We need a new Earth to
replace the one we destroyed, a place where we can go
and breed like rabbits and fuck it all up over and over
again. We need to know that we can expand beyond
this solar system, because right now it’s feeling a little
confining, like we could be easily trapped and wiped
out if the TITANs ever return. We need to know that
we have a future. We need to know that we can make
it through our own efforts. That we won’t do our-
selves in on our own.
   The Lost proved that. It was a noble objective, to
speed a new generation of children to adulthood, but
the process was flawed. Taking force-grown clones,
raising them in VR, and then dumping them into adult
bodies after they’ve only been alive for a few years
of objective time—but over eighteen years of their
subjective time? An entire childhood, having only
each other and AIs for company. It’s enough to fuck
anyone up. It was a grand experiment, but it failed,
and now we have another reminder of our failures
living among us.
   That’s us, in all our glory. Ten years after the Fall
and we remain a broken, squabbling mess, jailed by
slime molds, beaten by uppity software, and yet our
own worst enemies. Spreading out from a home we
don’t even have any more. Our numbers reduced and
dwindling further with each passing day. Who will
save us? We don’t even want to save ourselves most of
the time. Or so it seems.
   But if we don’t, there’s no future. And I, for one,
have not lived this fucking long to give up now. You,
me, we’re effectively immortal. The entire galaxy is
waiting out there for us. We’d be stupid not to go
see it.

THE SOLAR SYSTEM AFTER THE FALL
Before the Fall, the solar system had a population of
approximately eight billion, with all but five million
of these people living on Earth. The Fall wiped out
almost ninety-five percent of transhumanity, and
today the population of the solar system is slightly less
than half a billion, with almost all of these transhu-
mans living off the Earth. The lifestyles of these people
were almost unimaginable thirty years earlier—the
vast majority are immortals living in sealed habitats
on hostile alien planets or in sealed space colonies, the
largest of which hold more than a million inhabitants
and are many kilometers long.
   In this vastly changed setting with its vastly
changed inhabitants, the core concerns of humanity
remain much the same. People seek both material
abundance and social status, and they wrap them-
selves in various public and private ceremonies. Like
generations of humans before them, transhumans
separate themselves into different cultures and sub-
cultures, all of which enjoy a wide variety of physical
and virtual entertainments. Politics and economics
remain vitally important and as always, those who are
wealthy, powerful, and famous have a large degree of
control over the lives of those who are poor, relatively
powerless, and unknown.



TRANSHUMANITY
Humanity as a concept has been replaced with
transhumanity. Most people now alive left Earth as
infomorphs and were subsequently resleeved into new
morphs. Bodies are things that can be modified and
replaced, much as someone can alter or exchange a
suit of clothing. Identity is centered in the mind, which
can exist as a disembodied infomorph living in vir-
tual worlds or dwelling in a vast array of strange and
exotic morphs. While there are bioconservatives who
resist these many changes to identity and physicality,
they are very much in the minority.
  To most people, transhumanity has also been ex-
panded in scope to factor in non-human persons such
as AGIs and uplifts, though the rights and status of
these sentients is sometimes contested.
  As transhumans continue to absorb the ramifica-
tions of this new way of life, they face a new crop
of problems and issues. Two of the largest and most
important are the increase in inequality and the splin-
tering and separation of transhumanity into many
different clades.

INEQUALITY
The technologies first developed in the decade before
the Fall and refined in the decade after its end have
transformed humanity. In all but the most backwards,
impoverished, and repressive regions of the solar
system, the vast majority of humanity is smarter,

%%% txt/041.txt FIXME

healthier, and richer than any humans
have ever been. Additionally, individuals
can improve their minds and their bodies
in almost any fashion their imaginations
can dream up. Those who can afford the
right augmentations can think faster, never
forget anything they have ever learned,
become mathematical savants, and heal
from injuries many times faster than an
unmodified human. When resleeving is
combined with implants, transhumans can
gain even more amazing capabilities—but
these benefits are far from free.
   During the first decade after the Fall,
most of the surviving population was
relatively poor. Many were grateful to
have any morph at all. While the eco-
nomic situation has improved, significant
inequalities remain and seem unlikely to
change. Hundreds of millions of people
must make do with very basic splicers (p.
139), worker pods (p. 142), cases (p. 143),
or synths (p. 143), while a few million are
wealthy enough to have custom-designed
morphs created for them, complete with
all the augmentations they desire. These
same members of the elite live in luxuri-
ous villas and mansions, and in a few
cases privately-owned asteroids, while
most other people must make do with
a few hundred cubic meters of dwelling
space. However, while inequities of living
space are ancient, the issue of economic
inequality producing inequities of physi-
cal and mental capacities is both relatively
new and considerably more problematic.
   In regions using the old and transi-
tional economies (see p. 61), differences
between the rich and the poor are ex-
pressed in terms of money. In habitats
using the new economy (p. 62), wealth is
meaningless and status and opportunity
are denoted with reputation scores. In all
three economies, some people have more
than others, and because of this, tech-
nology allows the better off to be better
than the people around them. Skillware
lets people buy knowledge and exper-
tise, while multi-tasking and mental
speed implants allow individuals to get
more done at once. Someone fortunate
enough to acquire large numbers of such
augmentations is capable of significantly
more than someone who lacks them, and
so can do even more to increase their
money or rep, thus serving to further
perpetuate inequality. This problem is
less serious in the reputation-based econ-
omies of the outer system, however, as
it significantly easier to build reputation
through hard work and dedication, as
opposed to the rigidly-controlled mon-
etary economies of the inner system and
the Jovian Republic, where class strati-
fication is institutionalized and upward
mobility is largely a myth.
   As many supporters of the status quo
are fond of pointing out, even the “have-
nots” are smarter and healthier than
any previous generation of humans and
carry as much potential immortality as
the wealthiest member of the elite. It is
equally true, however, that in many ways
the divisions between rich and the poor
are significantly greater than they have
ever been, especially in the inner system.
In the past, the members of the elite might
be somewhat healthier and better fed than
the have-nots, but both rich and poor still
lived in relatively similar and fundamen-
tally human bodies. Now, the very nature
of humanity has been called into ques-
tion. The least fortunate can be forced
to inhabit bodies designed specifically
for the pleasure of those wealthier than
them or even denied any body and forced
to live as infomorphs until they can find
some way to acquire a new morph—typi-
cally by selling their services to the high-
est bidder. Meanwhile, the well-off can
customize their bodies and their minds,
enabling them to accomplish far more
and to be considerably more impressive
and charismatic than anyone lacking their
advantages. These inequalities may seem
insurmountable, but some anarchistic
groups and even some entire habitats
have dedicated themselves to reducing
inequities by producing low cost (and
occasionally highly unreliable) versions of
many of the more impressive morphs and
augmentations.

CLADES AND SEPARATION
In many habitats, hyper-augmented elites
rule a mass of humanity that is stuck using
low-end morphs and minimal augmenta-
tions, or even infomorphs living in rented
morphs, but this is not the only option
found in the solar system. Transhumanity
has splintered into a wide variety of sub-
cultures, some of which are based upon an
individual’s choice of morph. Some of this
separation is due to the necessity of inhabit-
ing difficult environments. From aquanauts
living in Europa’s aquatic environment or
rusters on Mars to the fact that zero-g habi-
tats are relatively inexpensive and are best
inhabited by microgravity-adapted morphs
like bouncers, many unusual environments
require those living in them to choose from a very lim-
ited range of morphs. Sometimes, though, this separation
is ideological in nature, such as the rise of groups like the
ultimates (p. 82) or some of the separatist uplift commu-
nities that seek to define their own space separate from
human cultures.
   There are dozens of specialist morphs and an even
greater number of habitats or other settlements that
are inhabited largely or exclusively by individuals
using a single type of morph or a limited number of
specialist morphs. In the asteroid belt and in the rings
and smaller moons of Saturn, there are more than one
hundred habitats that do not rotate, with all portions
in zero or near-zero gravity. The inhabitants typically
use bouncer or novacrab morphs, along with a small
number of synthetic morphs and other pods.
   There is also a vast number of other habitats that
are segregated in various other ways, including ones
where all permanent residents are uplifts inhabiting


> FIRST CONTACT: THE FACTORS (FIXME)

one of the various transgenic morphs, like the octo-
morph or neo-avian morphs. Other habitats are only
open to residents with various enhanced morphs like
exalts or mentons. There are even habitats where all
residents must inhabit morphs that are all clones of
one another. In almost all of these habitats, residents
are free to add whatever augmentations they wish to
their morphs, but some habitats forbid residents from
changing their morph’s external appearance, and in-
dividuals who violate this rule are forced to leave the
habitat if they refuse to reverse these changes.
   Some habitats do away with the necessity of
both life support and gravity. In these locations, all
residents are infomorphs who either inhabit their own
synth bodies or, in a few very eccentric cases, where
all of the inhabitants are infomorphs who spend most
of their existence in the habitat’s central computers.
When they need to interact with the physical world,
these infomorphs are free to use one of the many
synthmorphs that the habitat owns and that the resi-
dents share among themselves. Although considered
quite eccentric to many and horrifying to bioconser-
vatives, habitats inhabited solely by synthmorphs or
infomorphs are among the least expensive to build
and maintain and are a low-cost way for groups of
infomorph refugees from Earth to gain independence.
Because individuals who choose this way of life have
often spent a decade or more as infomorphs, this
option often seems both familiar and in many ways
more comfortable than inhabiting a living morph. As
Earth becomes more distant in transhumanity’s collec-
tive memory, its traditions and social norms hold less
sway and people feel more free to create and use new
bodies and new ways of life to go along with them.


CULTURE AND SOCIETY
The Fall and its aftermath continues to be a major
influence on transhuman culture and society. Prior
to the start of the evacuation, more than ninety-nine
percent of the people who survived the Fall had never
been off Earth. For them, space was a distant realm
where other, more daring and adventurous people
lived, a place Earth dwellers only saw on videos. Earth
was their home. Then, in the course of a few short
years, hundreds of millions of people were forced to
leave Earth. The fortunate few first evacuees left with
no more than a dozen kilograms of possessions, while
the vast majority were infomorph refugees who left
Earth with nothing, not even their bodies.
   Today, transhumanity is divided into three groups.
The first group contains the true veterans of space
life, the less-than-one-percent of humanity that was
already living in space before the Fall. The second
group is the ten percent of the population that was
either born after the Fall or is too young to remember
living on Earth. The remaining eighty-nine percent of
the current population of the solar system lived gener-
ally happy and prosperous lives on Earth before the
Fall forced them to flee for their lives. These refugees
from Earth form a powerful social force, but as time
goes on memories of Earth grow dim, and people
adapt to their new homes and lives.

THE LONGING FOR EARTH

Most of transhumanity, especially those who were
forced to flee from the dying Earth, still mourn their
former home. Their longing for and nostalgia of
Earth has profoundly affected transhuman culture.
Artifacts from Earth, including ones as trivial as
coins or bits of dried vegetation, are considered to
be treasured mementos that have great economic and
emotional value.
  The interdiction of Earth makes acquiring such
artifacts quite difficult and dangerous. As a result, the
trade in Earth artifacts is a lucrative portion of the
black market, enough so that fearless scavengers are
willing to risk being shot down by a patrolling killsat
just to get to Earth, where they also face death from

numerous lingering dangers. The mesh is peppered
with stories of daring explorers who traveled to Earth
to retrieve all manner of priceless relics, as well as
an equal number of stories about explorers who died
or simply vanished on such expeditions. More than
one team of gatecrashers has funded their expedi-
tion through a preliminary relic-hunting expedition
to Earth, which serves to test their mettle while they
work to raise funds.
   Nostalgia for Earth also affects the way transhu-
manity has redesigned itself. In the decade prior to
the Fall, humanity had begun to freely alter itself,
with both radical body modification and the first
commercial resleeving resulting in a growing number
of obviously non-human morphs. The vast majority
of current morphs, however, are relatively human
in appearance (if not in internal structure). Even for
people too young to remember the Fall, asserting
individual humanity is an important part of post-
Fall culture. Some people keep a resemblance to the
traditional human form as a remembrance of Earth,
while others do it to celebrate humanity’s victory over
the monstrous and inhuman TITANs that attempted
to destroy them. With the exception of a few eccentric
groups like the ultimates, the majority of humanity
values looking human and preserving human tradi-
tions and institutions. Also, even the ultimates’ cur-
rent version of their remade morph is considerably
more human looking than the versions their predeces-
sors designed before the Fall. As a result, while synth-
morphs are relatively common, most are made to look
humanoid. There are a few radically inhuman morphs

> AN EXSURGENT THREAT? (FIXME)

like the novacrab, the arachnoid, and the flexbot, but
they are almost exclusively used for highly specialized
purposes. Until recently, anyone who used one as their
primary morph was considered deeply eccentric (or
worse), but attitudes have gradually begun to soften,
and these morphs are gradually becoming more ac-
ceptable for regular use.
   This mixture of reverence and nostalgia for Earth
sometimes has a darker side. Individuals who choose
to have morphs that look visibly non-human expe-
rience a mild degree of prejudice in many habitats,
and militant bioconservatives denounce those who
look sufficiently non-human as being covert allies
of the TITANs. Uplifted animals also face significant
discrimination from many humans. These prejudices
are relatively common in the inner system and can
be quite extreme among bioconservatives. As a result,
uplifts and individuals who prefer inhuman-looking
morphs often live in separatist communities in the
outer system. In much of the inner system, uplifts and
individuals using a visibly non-human morph as their
primary or only morph are viewed with suspicion and
occasionally treated as second-class citizens. While
most habitats have laws mandating morphological
freedom and many also have laws making prejudice
based on morphological choice illegal, these attitudes
remain quite resilient.

 FEAR AND PARANOIA
The Fall left behind a persistent legacy of fear. This has
faded over the past decade, but a great many humans
still unconsciously expect the other shoe to drop and
the TITANs to return at any moment. Others worry
that their agents are already among them, preparing for
the complete destruction of humanity. The arrival of
the Factors caused widespread panic, and even today a
substantial minority of people assumes they are cat’s-
paws for the TITANs—or possibly their creations.
   There are a few (often insane or deeply eccentric)
people who worship the TITANs or otherwise support
their agenda (including self-described “singularity
seekers” who hope to find and be uploaded by the
TITANs to join their ascension to super-intelligence),
but all of them must keep their beliefs carefully hidden.
   Even now, expressing any support for the TITANs or
advocating the creation of self-improving seed AIs
is illegal in most habitats. Anyone who does so runs
the risk of becoming the target of mob violence that
the authorities are unlikely to investigate too closely.
Merely being suspected of being a supporter of the
TITANs, or worse, someone who has been secretly
infected by them and is now their agent, is enough
to get someone shunned or even killed. While such
incidents are now far rarer than they were in the first
few years after the Fall, people who act too eccentric
and who lack someone with a sufficiently high rep to
defend them or explain their actions are occasionally
killed, typically by being thrown out an airlock. Those
responsible for these “spacings” are dealt with quite
harshly in most habitats, since in almost all cases later
investigation reveals that the victim had no connec-
tion to the TITANs.
   There are also periodic rumors in many habitats, es-
pecially small and isolated habitats, that one or more
other habitats have been taken over by the TITANs,
leading to a variety of inter-habitat problems. Such
rumors are usually resolved fairly quickly, but the
most persistent can seriously harm relations between
habitats. Claims that other habitats are infested with
or even controlled by agents of the TITANs are fre-
quenly employed by extreme bioconservatives hoping
to demonize radical habitats populated entirely by in-
fomorphs or synthmorphs. As more people manage to
put the fear and horror of the Fall behind them, such
claims are less likely to be believed. Unfortunately,
on very rare occasions, people are still infected by
TITAN-created relics and actually become their un-
willing agents. Since such incidents are rare, however,
they have become easy to dismiss.

REAL AND SOCIAL DISTANCE
The vast distances between most habitats give all com-
munications—with the exception of those using the
rare and expensive QE communicators (p. 314)—a
significant time lag between asking a question and

> SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: SINGULARITY SEEKERS (FIXME)

receiving an answer. In most cases, the time lag ranges
from ten seconds to several hours, and it makes real-
time communications between distant habitats difficult
or impossible. Communication problems only serve to
further isolate habitats from one another, and as a result
people socialize primarily with members of their own
habitat (or habitat cluster, if their habitat is part of one
of the various groupings of between two and twenty
habitats that abound throughout the solar system).
   Within a habitat or habitat group, communication
between residents is effectively instantaneous, thanks
to the omnipresent wireless grid known as the mesh
(p. 234). Anyone wearing a mid-range ecto (p. 325)
or using basic mesh inserts (p. 300) can communicate
with others in ways that go far beyond mere voice
contact. Both devices allow AR communications that
are in most ways barely distinguishable from in-per-
son communication, so people can effectively spend
in-person time with anyone in their habitat at any
moment when both of them are free and interested in
communicating. Unless someone deliberately wishes
to turn off communication because they are sleeping
or otherwise busy, people can always get in touch
with one another. Many close friends and romantic
partners regularly communicate anytime they have
a spare moment, sharing comments and jokes. This
communication is far more awkward and distant if
there is a time lag of several minutes between every
comment, so inter-habitat communication is never as
informal or close.
   Although travel via egocasting (tramsitting an ego
to another habitat, where it is resleeved) is as easy,
if not as cheap, as communication, a trip to another
habitat is considered to be a significant journey with
a range of costs. Individuals traveling to a different
habitat will no longer be able to engage in real-time
communication or shared real-time entertainments
with people back on the habitat they left, so the
traveler will have to find a new social environment.
In addition to the trouble and expense of acquiring
a new morph in the new habitat, the social distance
between individuals and the social network they leave
behind is part of the cost of travel.
  Before the Fall, refugees from Earth were ac-
customed to being able to easily communicate with
anyone else on Earth. Wealthier individuals could
easily journey just about anywhere on the planet in a
few hours while still being able to communicate with
everyone back in their home city with no noticeable
change. The exodus of transhumanity from Earth,
though, means that an individual’s social world is
only as large as their habitat. Even a relatively brief
communication lag, such as the two to thirty seconds
that is the average time lag between any two of the
Jovian or Saturnian moons, greatly hinders the flow of
back-and-forth communication. When time-lags are
involved, most communication consists of messages
rather than any attempt at continuous conversations.
In situations where a more in-depth discussion is nec-
essary and time is limited, someone can send a fork
of themselves—a digital copy (p. 273)—to hold the
discussion remotely on their behalf, and then return
for re-integration. Since there is already a large time
lag between sending a message and obtaining any pos-
sible response, most people do not hurry to answer
messages from distant habitats except in the most
urgent circumstances, further isolating people residing
in distant portions of the solar system.

THE RISE OF CULTURAL REGIONS
The only exception to the social distance between dif-
ferent habitats occurs when colonies are located on
or in relatively close orbit around the same planet or
moon. The inhabitants of Mars can all communicate
with one another instantaneously, as can everyone
on Luna or in Lunar orbit. However, the rivalry be-
tween the various Martian city-states—and between
the primary hypercorp domes and the rural Martian
poor—imposes its own social distance. Individuals
from different city-states do socialize, but among the
elite social cliques, spending too much time commu-
nicating with members of another city-state is viewed
as somewhat odd and potentially even disloyal. As
a result, Martians tend to be relatively isolated even
from their close neighbors. Nevertheless, the short
distances between the Martian city-states and the
orbiting habitats mean that there remains a general
Martian culture that is different from the cultures of
the rest of the solar system.
   Distance barriers have produced similar levels of
cultural differentiation in other portions of the solar
system. The colonies in the vicinity of both Jupiter
and Saturn each form a separate cultural unit, as do
the colonies in Earth orbit and on and around Luna.
The same is true for the Jovian Trojan and Greek as-
teroids. In each of these regions, people communicate
and travel more between habitats and settlements
than they do with outside regions.
   Social scientists refer to the different sections of the
solar system as separate cultural regions. The different
regions of the belt also each form a similar cultural
region, but because asteroids in different orbits even-
tually drift quite far apart, the cohesion and unity of
these cultural units is somewhat weaker. Habitats on
the edge of the solar system (around Uranus, Neptune,
and Pluto) form very small cultural regions, but the
few habitats in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud have
no cultural region since the distance between them is
so extreme.
   Though communications between habitats within
the same cultural region is somewhat awkward due
to intra-regional cultural differences and small time-
lags, it is usually fast and easy enough for people on
different habitats to keep in regular contact with one
another. In addition, most habitats within the same
cultural region are sufficiently close that egocasting
between them is affordable by most people. In con-
trast, egocasting between cultural regions is relatively
expensive. Many social scientists predict that within
one or two decades, different cultural regions will be
at least as different from one another as distant na-
tions of Earth were from one another during the first
half of the 20th century—perhaps even more so due
to the physical alterations that cultures introduce as
they continue to evolve.

CULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION
While nostalgia for Earth remains a powerful social
motivation, the break from Earth led many inhabit-
ants of the solar system to experiment with new
forms of culture and society. Since the Fall destroyed
physical links with the past and the defeat of the last
old-Earth governments ended ideological ties with the
old political and social forces, many transhumans saw
themselves as living in a new, free era where the past
was dead. Even people who always wear nostalgia
jewelry and spend several hours a day in simulspaces
set on old Earth are very interested in the possibility
of social and political experimentation. Those without
criticisms of Earth’s nation-states and their many fail-
ings still rue the day when Earth fell.
   Many of the most extreme social experimenters
moved to the numerous small outer system habitats
that were created in the decade after the Fall, but
people interested in social and cultural experimenta-
tion can be found throughout the solar system. In ad-
dition to playing with various interior structure and
design ideas, the inhabitants of many stations experi-
ment with all manner of unique social and political
rules. A few habitats do so quite deliberately, either
because the members are interested in social innova-
tion or because researchers associated with a hyper-
corp or university have offered them goods or services
in return for testing one of their latest theories. Such
experiments have included establishing stations where
all of the residents are sleeved in hermaphroditic
morphs in order to measure the impact on customs
and language when gender is abolished or spurring
the residents of a particular station to freely switch
their morphs based on the responsibilities and duties
they have on a given day. Such staged experiments are,
however, relatively rare—the vast majority of unique
customs and social structures that have come about
since the Fall naturally evolved from groups of like-
minded individuals living together in the same habitat
and working, consciously or not, to make life better
fit with their aesthetics or ideology.

GENDER, SEXUALITY, AND RELATIONSHIPS
To many transhumans, gender has become an outdat-
ed social construct with no basis in biology. After all,
it’s hard to give credence to gender roles when an ego
can easily modify their sex, switch skins, or experience
the lives of others via XP. Though most transhumans
still adhere to the gender associated with their original
biological sex, many others switch gender identities
as soon as they reach adulthood or avidly pursue
repeated transgender switching. Still others examine
and adopt untraditional sex-gender identities such as
neuters (believing a lack of sex allows greater focus in
their pursuits) or dual gender (the best of both worlds).
In many bioconservative habitats and cultures, how-
ever, more traditional gender roles persevere.
   Sexuality has also expanded into new frontiers and
taboos. With basic biomods providing contraception
and protections from STDs, casual sex is the norm.
Many people pursue careers as well-paid companions
and escorts. In fact, sexual experimentation is stan-
dard thanks to several new technologies. Virtual real-
ity allows sexual encounters without physically touch-
ing a partner, not to mention bringing all manner of
fantasies to life. For those that prefer the touch of real
skin, AI-driven pleasure pods can fulfill any and all
needs and are a legal form of prostitution in many
habitats. Sex-switching also lends itself to new experi-
ences, whether via bio-mods or a new sleeve. Even
AGIs, having been socialized as humans, exhibit sexu-
ality and desire.
   The extension of lifespans and the decline of reli-
gion have drastically impacted social institutions like
marriage. Given the possible changes to both cogni-
tion and biology over a transhuman’s lifetime, lifelong
relationships are no longer considered realistic. The
idea of long-term relationships as a social contract
has grown exponentially. While this has resulted in
a number of marriages that are political or like a
business transaction, most people continue to view
marriage as a bond of emotional attachment and
trusts—in particular a bond that transcends bodies,
as either partner may change morphs at any time.

THE DIVERSITY OF HABITATS
The ability of a few thousand like-minded people of
moderate means to acquire a small habitat where
they can create their own society resembles the
ability of inhabitants of the United States in the
19th century to set out for the West and found their
own ideologically based communities. The primary
difference is that creating such communities is faster
and easier in the modern era. The mesh is filled with
all manner of virtual communities where members
hope to eventually gather the means to create their
own habitats. In most cases, these are merely idle
dreams; most participants are not willing to sacrifice
the time and rep or money needed. Occasionally the
members try, only to find out that some of the people
promoting this effort are con artists. Occasionally
virtual subcultures manage to raise the necessary
dedication and trust to build their own habitat and
begin the process of creating their own physical so-
ciety. A decade of this sort of cultural experimenta-
tion by many hundreds of habitats has produced a
number of unique and strange societies.
   As an example, there are habitats where the in-
habitants wear garments and AR images that cover
their bodies—and, in the most extreme cases, their
faces—and residents only reveal their morph’s true
appearance to their closest friends and immediate
family. There are also stations where all members use
cosmetic modification to adopt the same ideal look,
as well as ones where all residents use morphs that
are clones of one another. Some of the most eccentric
habitats are populated by extreme bioconservatives
overcome with nostalgia for the past, leading them
to model both their society and all visible technology
after some earlier period in history, typically some
time between zero and 50 years BF.
   There are even a few habitats that totally disregard
commonly held feelings about forks and merging.
Such community members regularly split off mul-
tiple forks when they awaken and plan their day
and then merge the various forks when they go to
sleep that night. Some forks remain infomorphs for
the day, while others use one of the various morphs
the individual owns or rents, which means that each
resident typically lives between two and six separate
lives every day. A few societies, like the home of the
infamous Pax Familiae, go even further—all residents
are forks of the same individual. In some of these
solipsistic habitats, the forks are all expected to use
cloned morphs, while in others each fork is consid-
ered a separate person who should go and forge their
own unique life. Some of the less extreme manifesta-
tions of this type of habitat include places inhabited
by families that are partially or entirely composed of
forks of one of the members (the various forks tend to
be treated as siblings).



TECHNOLOGY
Technology pervades all aspects of existence in Eclipse
Phase. Most individuals understand that unless hu-
manity suffers another event like the Fall or they per-
sonally suffer some very serious and unlikely accident,
they are unlikely to permanently die. More people are
now planning for a very long future. For most people
these schemes are fairly minimal, but they often in-
clude an awareness that few, if any, relationships are
likely to last an entire lifetime. However, functional
immortality is only one of the many wonders of the
modern world.

LIVING WITH INFOTECH
For anyone with basic mesh inserts (p. 300) or an ecto
(meaning about ninety-six percent of the population),
life is filled with data. For people with the best im-
plants, all information available on the mesh is avail-
able at a thought. For everyone else, it only requires a
brief pause to access and understand it. When some-
one pauses and looks a bit distracted in the midst of a
conversation, everyone understands they are accessing
data and lack the implants to allow them to do this
subconsciously or via multi-tasking. As a result, when
a group of people are discussing a topic and no one
immediately knows an answer to a question, such as
the title of a performer’s first vid, within a few seconds

> OPENING PANDORA’S GATE (FIXME)

everyone has this information. Similarly, when some-
one walks through a garden, with a glance and
perhaps a brief thought or small finger motion, they
can call up detailed data on each and every species of
plant that sits in front of them. Individuals going to
remote areas that are out of normal mesh broadcast-
ing range almost always either carry a farcaster-link
with them or download truly vast amounts of data
into their implants or ecto so they can continue to
access all the data they might need. Since even a basic
implant can hold vast amounts of data, lack of storage
space is rarely an issue.
  Access to such a vast amount of easily available
information has resulted in a variety of cultural
responses. Being able to quote from any vid, old movie,
book, or historical speech is now trivially easy and
can be done with a few seconds of thought. While
children and young teens often play by interjecting
large amounts of semi-appropriate famous quotes in
their speech, most adults only do so for emphasis and
in moderation. People who quote from other sources
too often are considered dull and unimaginative. Rec-
ognizing such quotes is quite easy, since someone can
simply set their muse to alert them to the nature and
identity of all lengthy quotes they hear.
  All experienced mesh users also learn (typically as
children and teens) how to avoid taking too much
time out from conversations to check facts or access
information via the mesh. Teens regularly mock their
fellows who pause too often or too long in conver-
sations to look up further information on a topic
someone mentioned, or who spend too long trying
to assemble facts to support an argument. Terms like
“meshed out” or “drooler” are used by teens to mock
each other into learning how to be both discreet and
faster in their information searches, at least when also
interacting with others. While adults rarely engage
in the same sort of direct and obvious mockery,
people who get too lost in casual or conversational
meshbrowsing are widely viewed as socially inept. As
a result, implants that allow multi-tasking or tempo-
rarily speed up thought are in great demand, since
they allow individuals to do extensive research and
rehearse each statement they are going to make with-
out a moment’s pause. People who can afford such
software almost always seem more suave, charismatic,
and intelligent than those who do not.
  All this means that those who lack all mesh and AR
access—individuals known as zeroes—present a stark
contrast to the rest of transhumanity. To most people,
zeroes seem slow, forgetful, and almost unbelievably
dense, while to zeroes, even people who only possess
ectos or basic implants seems brilliant, witty, and able
to comprehend things with almost inhuman speed.

GOING BEYOND THE KNOWN
One of the oddest experiences for gatecrashers and
others who explore unusual environments such as the
ruins of Earth is the unavailability of data. They look
at an alien plant or a TITAN-mutated person, and
their search returns various error messages meaning
that there is either no data at all on the subject or
that the only data is purely speculative and should
be regarded as dangerously unreliable. This can be
especially troubling when the subject in question is
a small creature that has just landed on the person’s
shoulder and the individual wants to know if it’s
harmless or deadly. Most people who are less than
sixty years old have never been in an environment
where they could not gain basic information about
everything around them at a glance. Learning to over-
come the shock of not knowing anything at all about
something is one of the first and most crucial skills all
gatecrashers must learn.

MUSES
Most individuals have a dedicated AI that serves as
their media agent. Commonly known as a muse, this
AI has been a lifelong companion for most people
less than seventy years old. Muses learn their owners’
tastes, habits, and preferences, and do their best to
make life and technology use as easy as possible.
Muses can be alarm clocks, data retrieval gophers,
appointment schedulers, accountants, and many other
functions often limited only by their owners’ imagina-
tions. Some of their tasks do not even need to be as-
signed them—muses are skilled at figuring out people’s
needs and acting on them. For example, the muse’s
scheduling function may tell it when its user needs to
be up in the morning, and it will act as an alarm clock
without any additional instructions from the user. If a
muse is uncertain about its owner’s preferences, it asks,
but after working with a user for a few decades muses
rarely need to do this. Most people keep multiple
back-ups of their muse, because the loss of a muse
can be almost as traumatic as the death of a loved one.
Using a generic muse who must be informed about
all aspects of a user’s individual preferences and fed a
constant stream of instructions helps people appreci-
ate the value of their own personal muse agent. Muses
generally learn the basics of a new user’s preferences
in a month or two, but during that learning period the
user tends to be irritable and forgetful, since the tasks
they generally trust their muse to do automatically are
not being taken care of.

ATTITUDES TOWARD AGIS
The vast majority of transhumanity blames the Fall on
rogue seed AIs (self-improving artificial intelligences).
As a result, any AIs that are not crippled or some-
how limited from improving themselves—including
the AGIs (artificial general intelligences) that were
common and growing in number before the Fall—are
completely illegal in many habitats, or at least heavily
regulated. The Fall ended only slightly more than a
decade ago, and many transhumans consider AGIs
and the TITANs that murdered their homeworld to
be one and the same.
   In addition to strict anti-AGI laws, there have been
occasional riots and mass panics surrounding facili-
ties still performing AGI research, which has pushed
most such research into isolated settlements. Never-
theless, there are still people passionately devoted to
AGIs; some see them as the next step in posthuman
evolution, others value all sentience, and still others
actually worship them. However, AGI supporters have
learned to keep their opinions private in mixed com-
pany, lest they be branded an agent of the TITANs.
   In some spots, mostly in the more anarchistic outer
system, attitudes towards AGIs are more relaxed and
AGIs may even be openly welcomed. These places
recognize that AGIs are not the same threat posed by
seed AIs and it is unfair to punish one for the actions
of the other. Naturally, these places are havens for the
AGIs active in transhuman society, who otherwise
must disguise their true natures.
   In the tightly-controlled inner system, the hyper-
corps and the Planetary Consortium foster anti-AGI
sentiments both as safety measures and as protection
against possible competitors. This latter point is one
of the things that makes them attractive to some
people in the outer system; they understand the great
advantages their factions gain … assuming, that is,
that those AGIs share your goals and ideals.

ATTITUDES TOWARDS MENTAL ALTERATIONS
In the post-Fall solar system, technology can alter peo-
ple’s minds; controversy about many of these altera-
tions remains. Few people have trouble with the idea
of creating short-term forks using the multi-tasking
augmentation or some similar process that insures
the forks will be re-integrated within a few hours.
However, the idea of long-term forks, and especially
of allowing forks to gain access to their own separate
morphs, troubles many people. Since there are not
enough morphs to go around in the first place, pro-
viding morphs to a fork strikes many people as selfish
and wasteful. As a result, on the rare occasion that
people sleeve one of their forks, they typically provide
it with a synthmorph to avoid the social stigma associ-
ated with using more than one body at a time.
   Forks that exist for more than a few hours inspire
discomfort in many people because the forks begin to
diverge slightly in personality. Most people find the
idea of two different and distinct versions of them-
selves to be somewhat disturbing. While there are
habitats (mostly in the outer system) where forking
is a regular part of daily life and forks often exist in-
dependently for a day or two, most visitors find such
habitats distasteful and bizarre.
   However, while voluntary forking is still regarded
as somewhat odd, involuntary uses of this and the
associated mental technologies are so horrifying that
they form the basis of much lurid crime fiction. Some-
one being unknowingly mind-napped and having an
involuntary—and often secret—fork created is some-
thing that people regard with abject terror, despite it
being quite rare. Similarly, while mental surgery to
correct psychiatric problems or as punishment for
various serious crimes is frightening and disturbing
in its own right, illegal brain hacking draws horror
and disgust from almost everyone in the solar system.
Penalties for involuntary forking and mind hacking
are exceptionally high. In many habitats, they are
among the few crimes punishable by death (including
the destruction of all backups and forks).

TRAVEL
Travel between habitats and other transhuman colo-
nies is both exceedingly easy and fairly costly. Long-
range egocasting is expensive, as is acquiring a morph
at the destination. Travelers have developed various
ways around this obstacle; for example, if someone
only needs to visit another habitat for a few days and
is visiting primarily to engage in real-time communi-
cation, they often choose to remain an infomorph for
the duration of their visit and to communicate via AR,
thus saving all resleeving expenses. For visitors who
require a morph but will not be staying long, most
habitats offer the option of renting a generic splicer
or synthmorph or, for a slightly higher cost, a generic
exalt morph. Habitats or worlds with unusual re-
quirements, like Mars, Europa, or the various zero-g
habitats offer ruster, aquanaut, or bouncer morphs
instead of splicers. These morphs can be used for up to
a week without much difficulty, and using one for up
to a month is usually possible with sufficient negotia-
tion and payment. Meanwhile, the traveler’s previous
morph is kept in medical stasis back in their home
habitat, waiting for their ego to return.
   Another technique is morph trading by people from
different habitats who know each other and who are
traveling at the same time. A few people do this with
strangers they meet on the mesh, but vids and other
entertainments are filled with tales of people having
their morphs or their identity stolen. A few of these
horror stories are based on actual accounts. Very few
people are willing to let anyone they do not know and
trust use their body, and many people simply will not
lend out their morph to anyone at all.
   Some people, however, are willing, for a fee, to act
as a living “taxi” for a visiting infomorph, carrying
it around with them. In these cases the “ghostriding”
infomorph is not permitted to control their host’s
morph directly and is simply a passenger along for
the ride, issuing directions and communicating with
their transporters electronically.
   Travelers who wish to either immigrate to a new
habitat or visit one for several months or longer
must acquire their own morph. Usually, they reduce
the cost of acquiring a new morph by selling their
previous morph to a body bank. Alternately, some
individuals sleeved in expensive custom-designed
morphs who are traveling relatively short distances
will rent a generic shell for several weeks and ar-
range to have their old morph shipped to them on
a fairly rapid freighter. Doing this is rarely more
than a moderate expense, which makes it less expen-
sive than the costs of buying or replacing high-end
custom modified morphs.

PRIVACY
Privacy is a prized possession for most inhabitants of
the solar system, but it is so rare that for many people
it might as well be a foreign concept. In the 20th and
early 21st century, privacy consisted of two concepts
that are now completely separate—the ability to remain
unnoticed or anonymous and the ability to avoid un-
wanted intrusion. The first is largely absent from the
lives of most people in the present day. Anyone who
uploads anything to a non-private portion of the mesh
understands that anyone who wishes to do so can gain
access to it. Likewise, anyone who spends time in a
public place understands that anyone can learn where
they went, what they did, and what they said due to the
ubiquity of meshed, sensor-enabled devices. As a result,
everyone’s public life, both on the mesh and in person,
can be transformed into an easily searchable database.
Almost everyone keeps such a record of their own lives,
commonly known as a lifelog. Most people allow their
lifelogs to be public, understanding that anonymity is
now an archaic concept.

> SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: INCAPACITATING INPUTS

   While the interiors of private dwellings remain free
from continuous surveillance, almost all habitats have
emergency sensors in every building providing a full
record of events to emergency service workers and AIs
in case of problems such as dangerous chemical leak,
a sufficiently large fire, an explosion, loss of air pres-
sure, or some other equally dramatic and potentially
dangerous event. Both the events of the Fall and the
fact that almost all of humanity now lives in habitats
surrounded by hostile environments mean that such
sensors are standard fare. A few habitats do not allow
emergency sensors in private dwellings, but most
people regard these habitats as potential death traps.
These emergency sensors do not record anything other
than the absence of potential dangers if they are not
triggered by specific events. This limitation allows
individuals privacy within their own residences—as
long as they are certain no one has planted a secret
recording device in their home. Ultimately, remaining
unobserved is a matter of both care and trust, and ev-
eryone understands that most of the time everything
they do will be part of the vast public record.
   In vivid contrast, the freedom to avoid unwanted
intrusion is carefully prized by the inhabitants of the
post-Fall era. Unwanted personal or data intrusion
into someone’s private dwelling or personal electronic
files is a crime in most habitats and a serious crime in
many. Also, while both the mesh and augmented real-
ity are filled with all manner of AI-mediated adware,
most of it has evolved to be relatively benign and to
provide non-intrusive suggestions about goods, infor-
mation, and services that are likely to be of legitimate
interest to the targeted person. An individual’s muse
filters out unwanted advertising. While it is certainly
possible to create advertising that can hack through
any muse’s filters, doing so is usually illegal.
   Unwanted AR intrusions are similarly limited.
During the early days of AR technology, there were
serious problems with users being overwhelmed with
unrequested and distracting input—as many said, the
mist got very thick indeed, so both law and custom
changed to prevent such invasions. Today, most people
expect to only experience data that they are looking for
or that they might be interested in, and that any data
they are not interested in will quickly vanish. Being
surrounded by a large amount of unwanted AR data
is not just annoying and distracting, it is also deeply
frightening, because it means that there is a serious
problem with either the habitat’s mesh or the person’s
electronics—it could even mean that the entire habitat
is under direct attack by infowar weapons.

LOW-TECH EXISTENCE
More than ninety-five percent of humanity inhabits
artificially created morphs. Most of them also possess
basic implants, and the vast majority of the rest wear
ectos with retina displays and other simple peripher-
als that allow the user to fully perceive and interact
with the vast network of information around them.
However, slightly less than four percent of the remain-
ing population inhabit flats or splicer morphs without
basic implants and also lack access to ectos and other
basic technologies.
   Since an ecto is both a relatively trivial expense and
a piece of equipment vital to existence in the solar
system, the only individuals who lack such technolo-
gies stand on the very lowest rungs of the social ladder.
A few are the poorest members of the most marginal
habitats, but most are slaves or the next best thing to
them. The lowest social classes in the Jovian Republic
lack personal infotech access and so do the lowest
class of people indentured to the hypercorps and the
Planetary Consortium, particularly on Luna and Mars.
These individuals are either indentured criminals or
people sufficiently lacking in useful skills that they are
assigned mindless physical tasks that cannot be more
efficiently performed by AIs.
  The lack of mesh access makes these unfortunate
“zeroes” into mental and social cripples, unable to per-
ceive the vast wealth of AR that most people take for
granted. They are also unable to communicate with
anyone beyond the range of their voice or to access
almost all information, including traffic signals and
shop displays. When necessary, the managers and
overseers in charge of groups of zeroes allow them
access to handheld meshbrowsers. These devices re-
semble the handheld terminals common in the early
21st century and have limited functionality, typically
forbidding communication and restricting mesh re-
search to carefully filtered topics.
   Because of their inability to access AR or the mesh,
zeroes are almost completely isolated from everyone
else, meaning they are also unable to organize ef-
fectively or to otherwise cause trouble for the people
who control them. In much of the outer system, the
existence of zeroes is considered one of the greatest
crimes against transhumanity perpetrated by the Plan-
etary Consortium and the Jovian Republic.

LIFE, DEATH, AND MORPHS
While death is no longer a certainty for transhumanity,
it remains a possibility. During the decade preceding
the Fall, most of humanity was growing used to the
idea that immortality was in their grasp. Then, in just
a few short years, the TITANs wiped out more than
ninety percent of us. Faced with the horror of so much
needless death, efforts to insure the lives of surviving
humans became a top priority. Now, the technology
of immortality—uploading, cortical stacks, and other
related wonders—is commonplace.
   Today, most of the residents of the solar system
have adjusted to this fact (except for the most extreme
bioconservatives); everyone expects both to live forever
and to have their friends, loved ones, and enemies do
the same. While death is rare, though, it is still possible.
Severe accidents can destroy someone’s cortical stack
as well as their brain, and egos can also be wiped away
in punishment for sufficiently heinous crimes—though
the process of execution is considerably more difficult
than it had been a few decades earlier.
   For most people (with the exception of those too
poor to afford a new morph), non-permanent death is
an annoyance equivalent to events that most people in
the late 20th century regarded as moderate misfortunes,
like a bad stomach flu or a broken arm. In almost all
habitats, if anyone is responsible for someone’s tempo-
rary death, either accidentally or on purpose, they are
also responsible for paying for the person’s resleeving
in an identical morph, especially if that person does not
have some form of resleeving insurance. People who
have temporarily died can expect to receive visits from
everyone they are at all close to after their resleeving,
as well as a host of e-cards and perhaps a few gifts
from their acquaintances and colleagues, all expressing
sympathy at their death and welcoming them back to
the world of the physically embodied. Exchanging such
“life gifts” is an accepted part of belonging to many
professions such as emergency service workers, where
members regularly risk temporary death.
   Deliberately choosing to change morphs or to tem-
porarily become an infomorph is treated differently.
People typically spend at least a day or two between
deciding to change morphs and actually doing so.
During this time, it is considered polite for someone
to inform everyone they know well or work with
about their upcoming resleeving. Along with personal
visits, as well as calls and e-cards detailing the time
of the upcoming event, the person who is resleeving
is expected to include an image of what their new
morph will look like, so people they know will be
able to easily recognize them. However, it is consid-
ered gauche for someone who is upgrading to a better
morph to include details about their new morph.
Within a few days of resleeving, a “resleeving party”
is typically held to introduce everyone they know
to their new morph. Depending upon how well-off,
well-known, and social the individual is, these parties
range from lavish affairs held in hotel ballrooms to
small intimate gatherings in the person’s home.
   Permanent death is treated very differently. Because
it is both relatively rare and no longer expected, the
old funerary rituals surrounding death have faded
and new traditions have grown in their place. Since
every death reminds many people of the billions who
permanently died during the Fall, most of the few
funerals that are held honor both the person who just
died as well as the victims of the Fall.

ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA
A substantial amount of media survives the Fall of
Earth, and a significant number of modern transhu-
mans make their living creating new songs, stories,
reports, or other media. All of this is easily and swiftly
accessible through any basic implant, ecto, or (on very
rare occasions) archaic handheld terminal. However,
most of this media is not to the taste of any particular
individual, and vast amounts of it are mediocre. As
a result, most humans keep two layers of evaluation
between them and anything they might consider ex-
posing themselves to.
  The first layer is based on popularity and critical re-
views. Every piece of media has a rating, often weight-
ed by the opinions of critics with high rep scores who
comment on their virtues and faults. Specialized AIs
also evaluate the responses of consumers, so individu-
als can use reviewers they trust or they can seek out
media that is either widely or specifically popular in
their particular demographic and subcultural niche.
  The second filter layer is the individual’s muse.
Muses learn their owner’s tastes and moods and au-
tomatically search out and recommend various sorts
of media. Individuals can do everything from asking
their muse to select something they will enjoy, to
asking for a something that will challenge their opin-
ions, to looking at all current events news that will
be of interest to them. Muses use their understanding
of their user’s preferences, mixed with ratings and
reviews, to make their decisions. Individuals can even
set their muses to edit all media so that they better fit
with the person’s interests and preferences. In the most
extreme cases, this process can twist and edit news
so that it bears no relation to real events. This same
process is used to make the characters and dialog in
novels and vids more appealing. More commonly, the
muses merely edit out aspects of a news story or ar-
ticle in which the individual is not interested.
   Ratings, reviews, and muses allow individuals
to avoid media overload, but they also reinforce
subcultural barriers. A great many people only seek
out media and news that reinforces their existing
opinions and beliefs. Xenophobic individuals who
distrust all non-humans, from uplifted octopi to the
Factors, regularly view news stories and AR dramas
about evil aliens and devious uplifted animals who
commit heinous crimes. Similarly, individuals who are
only interested in their own habitat have all external
news altered by their muses so that it refers only to
the effects outside events will have on their station.
   In a very real sense, individuals from radically
different subcultures and demographics inhabit com-
pletely different worlds. The one force that works
against this separation is the fact that many people
wish to follow the lives and opinions of those with
the highest reputation scores. In many cases, a large
portion of these individual’s high rep scores comes
from their interest in and willingness to interact with
(or at least acknowledge) a wide variety of different
sources of information. As a result, listening to opin-
ions by a high-rep celebrity can expose people to in-
formation that they might never encounter otherwise.
Also, in many habitats, AIs responsible for media dis-
tribution tag some news as being sufficiently impor-
tant that it should be immune to filtering by muses.

> METACELEBRITIES (FIXME)

This tagging is a regular and expected occurrence
in some habitats, while in others it is reserved for
only the most important and potentially life-saving
information. Bypassing muses for any less important
reason in these stations is considered a gross inva-
sion of privacy or even a crime.

POPULAR TYPES OF ENTERTAINMENT
The most popular forms of electronic entertainments
are vids, vidgames, VR worlds, XP, and AR games.

VIDS AND VIDGAMES
Vids are passive entertainments that can be enjoyed
either as high-resolution audiovisual entertainment or
as a fully immersive experience where the viewer can
augment their experience with smell, touch, and taste
while experiencing the point of view of one of the
major characters. Viewing them purely via sight and
sound is much like watching an old 20th-century film,
except that it’s interactive and in 3D. In contrast, full
sensory viewing is much like actually being present in
the story.
   Most modern vids have variable theme and prefer-
ence settings enabling viewers to adjust the content of
what they are watching, including the level of violence,
the amount and type of sexuality they prefer, as well
as the appearances of some or all of the major char-
acters. In addition, many vids have several alternate
endings for people who prefer happy, bittersweet, or
grim endings. As a result, two people watching the
same vid could have very different experiences if they
use radically different settings.
   Vidgames are like vids, except they are much more
flexible. In vidgames, the viewer not only experiences
the story with the protagonist—they become the pro-
tagonist, shaping the story through their own actions,
similar to sophisticated early-21st-century console
games. Some games allow the participation of up to a
dozen individuals or link thousands of players via the
mesh, while others are designed for a single player.
   The degree of freedom in vidgames varies. Some are
almost fully interactive realms similar to many VR
worlds with all but a few characters controlled by AIs,
while others are considerably simpler and more lim-
ited, with player interaction limited to a few crucial
decisions. The precise dividing line between vids and
vidgames is blurry, but both media have the common
trait of being designed for either solitary use or for
use by a few players or viewers who are all located
relatively near one another. Vids and vidgames are
the most popular forms of entertainment, with vids
and vidgames set on Earth before the Fall being espe-
cially prevalent.

XP
Experience playback (XP) is a specialized type of vid
that consists of the recorded sensory impressions of a
single individual. Almost all of the inhabitants of the
solar system lead relatively quiet and risk-averse lives
and are naturally eager to be able to vividly experience
adventures such as climbing Olympus Mons, spending
a day in one of the most luxurious and exotic private
habitats, going on a scavenging mission to Earth, or
gatecrashing. There is also a thriving fringe market in
less savory XPs, including records of people commit-
ting all manner of violent or dangerous crimes and
XPs of actual gun battles between well-armed crimi-
nals and law enforcement personnel, which often end
with the death of the morph providing the point of
view.
   Anyone with mesh inserts can create an XP of their
past experiences, and anyone with an ecto or mesh
inserts can access the sensory recordings. Selling a
particularly exciting XP, such as a record of the first
meeting with the Factors, can bring in a lot of money
or rep. Most XPs consist of both sensory recordings
and the surface thoughts of the individual who made
them. Many people who access XPs are only inter-
ested in the sensory recordings and feel that having
another person’s recorded thoughts and emotions in
their head is intrusive and uncomfortable. However,
some hardcore XP aficionados feel that accessing the
full XP, including the recorded emotions, makes the
experience more immersive and real.
   A significant minority of XP fans becomes fasci-
nated with one or two daring people who regularly
sell XPs, known as X-casters, viewing all of their clips,
including both the experiences and the accompanying
thoughts. Some of these XP fans become more inter-
ested in the person who recorded the clip than in the
individual experiences, and they often come to believe
that they have a special, clear understanding of this
person, to the point where they strongly identify with
this person or even fall in love with them. In addition,
individuals who access XPs from a single person often
enough sometimes begin to mimic various habits or
figures of speech of this person. Particularly popular
X-casters are sometimes rather disturbed when they
see tens of thousands of people imitating one of their
more idiosyncratic expressions or habits.
   A few serious fans—known as Xers (pronounced
“ex-ers”)—alter their morphs to resemble their favor-
ite X-caster. Some obsessive Xers actually attempt to
contact and stalk certain X-casters, perhaps hoping
to become part of an actual XP clip. In most habitats
and subcultures, Xers are widely regarded as having
particularly dull and meaningless lives. Hardcore
Xers are often viewed as being insecure and poten-
tially unstable.

AR GAMES
Augmented reality (AR) games involve players
interacting both with events in the physical world
and with augmented reality imagery that recasts the
people and objects the players see. For example, in-
stead of seeing another player in a splicer morph and
ordinary clothing, a player of an AR game might see
a horrific rotting zombie, a bizarre alien life form, or
a well-armed soldier. These games tend to be locally
focused within a particular habitat or city as they
allow players to interact when they are within physi-
cal proximity, but some games link habitats within
the same cultural region.
   The nature and intensity of these games varies
widely. Some are long-term games involving people
imagining that they are deep cover spies or some other
exciting and unique role. Players may pretend to be
anything from time travelers attempting to prevent
some horrible disaster to covert agents attempting
to uncover plots by TITAN-infected people on their
habitat—who happen to be camouflaged as snack
designers, personal assistants, etc. During their daily
lives, players exchange messages with each other as
well as with the people running and maintaining
the game. Some of these long-term AR games have
gone on for many years, with the oldest being almost
twenty years old.
   Short-term AR games, on the other hand, last be-
tween several hours and several days. The people run-
ning these games typically rent out a hotel or a park
and various public buildings for the duration. These
games are almost always highly dramatic and consist
of everything from the players having to deal with
a massive zombie attack or alien invasion to them
participating in some simulation of an event on Earth,
like the storming of the Bastille during the French
Revolution. While such AR games can be consider-
ably less detailed than VR worlds or vidgames, many
players value the “realism” of being physically present
during the game.
   Since participants in AR games take actions in the
real world, including actions that could be disruptive
or even dangerous, designers of AR games take great
care to prevent problems. In some early AR games,
most of which took place more than twenty years
before the Fall, players were occasionally seriously
injured. A few unscrupulous AR game designers used
their game as a cover for an actual robbery or act
of terrorism that was abetted by unwitting players
who thought their actions were simply part of a game.
   Since that time, law enforcement observation drones
have kept careful track of people playing AR games.
In almost all habitats, people running AR games must
register their games with local law enforcement or
face serious fines.

VR WORLDS
Virtual reality (VR) worlds are entertainments that
involve the creation of a large and highly immersive
simulated environment—a simulspace—where many
major characters are played by transhumans or other
sentient beings. Unlike vids or vidgames, simulspaces
are specifically designed for a large number of par-
ticipants. VR worlds consist of everything from dupli-
cates of various eras of Earth history to elaborate and
strange fantasy worlds with magic, dragons, and simi-
lar wonders. All manner of alien worlds or settings
based on oddities like time travel are also common. As
is the case with vids, the most popular simulspaces are
those set on Earth some time before the Fall.
   VR worlds can have from dozens to tens of thou-
sands of participants. For the best experience, many
users prefer to access simulspaces through hardwired
server connections as they offer better quality and
less disruptions than accessing wirelessly via the
mesh. Since people immersed in virtual reality are cut
off from their bodies and often thrash around, most
users ensconce their morphs in a tank or special couch
for the duration. VR parlors typically offer private
hardwired pods for participants to physically jack in.
Many habitats also have hardwired systems used just
for this purpose, so users can experience VR from the
comfort of their own dwellings.
   Due to distance and communication lags between
habitats, even the most popular online simulspaces
run each habitat as a separate realm, limiting interac-
tion with users in other habitats/realms. The popular-
ity of VR worlds like Gilded Empire, set in England
in the 1880s, means that someone moving from one
habitat or world to another could continue playing in
the same game, albeit with a new set of players.
   One of the other unusual features of VR settings is
that a large number of infomorphs, including many
infomorph refugees, play these games. As a result,
while even most novice players can learn to easily tell
the difference between a character played by an AI
and one played by an actual person, there is no way
to know if the person playing a character has a physi-
cal body or not.

PHYSICAL ENTERTAINMENT
In addition to a vast array of electronic and
electronically-mediated entertainments, people also
still enjoy a wide variety of physical sports, ranging
from soccer to new sports like low-g air races, where
the participants strap on wings and engage in tests
of speed and acrobatics. In addition, the ability to
both heal any injury in a healing vat and to remove a
cortical stack from a dead or dying body and place it
in a new morph has given rise to a new variety of ex-
treme sports. Starting a decade before the Fall, vari-
ous individuals began realizing that, barring unlikely
circumstances, they could not die unless they wanted
to. This set off a brief trend in extreme sports and
even a few wealthy suicide hobbyists, who repeatedly
killed off their current morph in a variety of unusual
ways. The Fall and the permanent death of more
than ninety percent of humanity greatly reduced the
interest in playing with death for many years. Kill-
ing yourself just to experience death is considered
at least mildly distasteful, and many believe such
actions belittle the mass deaths of the Fall. Though
interest in risking death in the line of entertainment
has been growing, deliberate suicide remains an ec-
centric and dubiously regarded hobby.
   In some subcultures, dueling has been a popular fad
for almost a decade. Swords, knives, and pistols firing
single-shot soft lead bullets are all popular choices,
because none of these weapons poses any threat to a
cortical stack and most do not instantly kill someone
hit by them. However, there are other more exotic
options, including aerial duels with microlights fitted
with blades on their wings. On rare occasions, duels
take place in space, with the participants wearing
non-armored vacuum suits. Certain criminal groups
make money with underground dueling circuits, pit-
ting biomorphs against robots against uplifts. The
seedier circuits engage in distasteful pit fights featur-
ing illegally-acquired backups sleeved into non-sen-
tient animals, often outfitted with lethal cybernetics.
Such creatures are typically quite mad.
   In addition, dangerous non-combative sports are
also popular. The highest levels of competitive rock
climbing on Mars are regularly done with no safety
equipment. There are similar climbing competitions
in many habitats using artificially constructed climb-
ing walls as well as regular free-running competitions
through almost every city and habitat. Also, there is
an entire class of sports, including both diving and
parachuting, where perfection of form is seen as
a far more important goal than avoiding injury or
even death. As a result, current high dive records for
morphs not specially modified to survive high impacts
are held by individuals who required either time in a
healing vat or resleeving immediately after their suc-
cessful breaking of a previous record.

POLITICS AND POWER
Politics is just as important in the colonies spread
throughout the solar system as it was back on Earth,
but it is also radically different. Each habitat or cluster
of stations is a separate political entity, and many of
these habitats are fiercely independent. The only loca-
tions where large political entities can exist are on the
marginally habitable worlds of Mars and Europa, and
the population of Europa is significantly smaller than
that of many of the largest pre-Fall cities on Earth.

THE INNER SYSTEM
Though nations no longer exist, they have been re-
placed by new political-economic entities that may
well have been on the road to dominance even if the
Fall had not occurred: the hypercorps. While there
are a many independent habitats and settlements in
the inner system, it is largely dominated by the hy-
percorps. To reduce conflict between themselves and
promote the survival of transhumanity, some of the
hypercorps have formed an alliance known as the
Planetary Consortium. This alliance governs most of
Mars and is in charge of the ongoing Martian terra-
forming project. It also controls several dozen other
habitats and many Lunar bases, mostly ones that are
in some way involved with the massive Martian ter-
raforming effort.
   Since Mars is home to more than forty percent of
the surviving transhuman population, most of the
human population lives under the rule of the hyper-
corps or the Planetary Consortium. In the aftermath
of the Fall, the hypercorps established three important
goals: rebuilding the solar system, protecting them-
selves from any further attacks (either by the TITANs
or any other threats), and growing in both wealth
and power. By extension, the second goal means they
also help protect the people living in the habitats
and settlements against any repeat of the Fall. The
hypercorps and the Planetary Consortium are exceed-
ingly skilled at attaining all of these goals. Since popu-
lar rebellion and widespread dissent are not helpful in
the least in attaining these goals, the hypercorps are
also adept at making certain the inhabitants of the
habitats and planetary settlements they control are
safe, relatively content, and, ideally, unable to cause
serious problems.
   As the largest and most well organized entities in
the solar system, the hypercorps, and especially the
Planetary Consortium, are in an excellent position to
protect the people living in their habitats and settle-
ments. However, this protection comes at the price
of freedom. Living in habitats that use transitional
economies (p. 61), the inhabitants of hypercorp-con-
trolled settlements are relatively well off and need not
fear starvation or serious want. Also, the hypercorps
strongly oppose bioconservatism, and so anyone who
can afford various augmentations or morphs is free
to obtain them, as long as none of these augmenta-
tions or morphs is equipped with weaponry that can
be used to harm the habitat or large numbers of its
inhabitants. In return for safety and relative prosper-
ity, however, inhabitants give up any ability to voice
more than token criticisms of the hypercorps of the
Planetary Consortium.

THE POWER OF THE HYPERCORPS AND THE PLANETARY CONSORTIUM
The hypercorps and associated Planetary Consortium
are the only major non-local political entities in the
solar system (with the possible exception of the Au-
tonomist Alliance, which is more of a mutual aid pact
than a unified political entity). All of the other politi-
cal entities are based in a single specific location. The
various hypercorps transcend location, however. They
have offices and branches all over the solar system,
serving the needs of people from Pluto to Mercury
and all places in between. While most hypercorps
have large manufacturing and processing installations
on Mercury or Venus, making use of the abundant
energy of the first and the complex chemistry of the
second, much of the work performed by all of the
hypercorps involves developing new technologies and
new cornucopia machine templates, both of which can
be done in any place that has meshbrowsing access.
   In addition to bases on Mercury, Venus, and other
equally resource-rich locations, all hypercorps main-
tain dedicated research and manufacturing stations
scattered throughout the solar system. Well-known
facilities include Starware’s vast shipyards, the largest
of which are located on Luna and the asteroid Vesta,
and Omnicor’s huge antimatter factory orbiting Mer-
cury. There are many other lesser-known facilities,
including the automated mines that the mysterious
Zrbny Group maintains in the main asteroid belt and
Saturn’s rings, and the qubit factory Nimbus main-
tains in Mars orbit.
   In addition, there is an even larger number of
secure and often secret research installations, some
of which are so well hidden that they are normally
only accessible via highly secure egocaster connec-
tions. All manner of mysterious and often highly
dangerous research occurs in such locations, ranging
from experiments with the relics of the TITANs to
attempts to create self-replicating nanotechnology or
artificial miniature black holes. Vids and vidgames
are filled with stories both of exotic disasters in
such research stations and of heroic thieves steal-
ing amazing wonders from them. While the reality
of secret corporate research bases is normally far
more prosaic, sometimes wonders are created—and
there have been occasional disasters, often involving
TITAN relics.
   Some corporate headquarters are similarly secure
and secret, including the corporate headquarters
of the fabled Zrbny Group. There are a wealth of
rumors and stories about such locations. Intrepid
spies, thieves, and reporters regularly attempt to gain
access to these facilities, generally without success.
Many such attempts, especially by would-be thieves
and spies, end with distinctly negative consequences,
including the thieves’ temporary (and on some occa-
sions permanent) death.
   Hypercorps also own and manage a number of
habitats. Many are primarily homes for hypercorp
employees, but in many of them at least half of the
population are simply ordinary residents of the solar
system who simply happen to live there. Though far
less regulated than hypercorp research or manufac-
turing facilities, these colonies are also subject to
greater regulation and security than some of the
autonomist-controlled habitats on the edges of the
solar system.
  These stations are exceptionally safe places to live.
Residents have access to all of the latest products
produced by the ruling hypercorp and its corporate
allies. The hypercorp habitats all either possess their
own security companies or have some form of de-
fense contract with a private security company, typi-
cally Direct Action or Medusan Shield, who agree to
protect the inhabitants against potential threats by
agents of the TITANs, fanatical saboteurs, or other
threats.
   These same security forces also protect the hyper-
corps from any threats to their interests. In most of
these habitats, residents have fairly open freedom
of expression and biological self-determination.
However, all potential threats to the hypercorp and
its personnel, ranging from attempted sabotage
to simple civil disobedience, are dealt with quite
harshly, with serious offences resulting in forced in-
denture and occasionally forced mental editing (see
Psychosurgery, p. 229). Almost all of these habitats
use a transitional economy (p. 61) and most residents
have a high standard of living to compensate for the
limits on their behavior. Many inhabitants of the
more independent colonies in the belt or the outer
system complain about the repressive nature of the
hypercorp-controlled habitats, but inhabitants of
these habitats prefer the safety and security found
there to the intimidating freedom of the outer system.
   To help reduce dissent, residents of settlements and
habitats controlled by the Planetary Consortium as
well as those controlled by hypercorps can vote on
a wide variety of issues. The results of these votes,
however, are only binding on issues that are not
considered “matters of habitat survival,” “corporate
policy,” or “security-related issues,” which effectively
includes any issue related to the security, profits, and
productivity of the hypercorps involved. Votes on
these issues are used in a purely advisory fashion,
meaning that they are utterly ignored when the result
of the vote is at odds with the hypercorps’ agendas.
   While residents of these settlements and habitats
can vote about adding a new holiday to honor some
important figure or the location and design of a
new park, laws regulating indentures, habitat secu-
rity, law-enforcement, or other important concerns
remain under the control of the hypercorps. This
does not mean, however, that the results of elections
are completely disregarded. If more than two-thirds
of the population strongly supports a particular
issue, the Consortium or the hypercorp controlling
the habitat usually finds ways to modify their current
policies to address these concerns without harm-
ing their own interests. In contrast, if only a small
number of residents are upset by certain policies,
then these wishes are ignored and habitat security
forces keep an eye out for possible civil disobedience
or other forms of resistance.
   In addition to these dedicated installations and
hypercorp-controlled habitats, many hypercorps
maintain offi ces in stations and planetary settle-
ments. Almost every habitat has a Nimbus office
with a farcaster and, in the case of larger habitats,
QE communicator facilities for instantaneous
communication. Both facilities are open to anyone
who can pay Nimbus’s fees. Ecologene, Skinaesthesia,
and several other hypercorps also have offices on
most habitats. Every habitat interested in interact-
ing with the rest of transhumanity has at least one
automated Experia media node. In smaller habitats,
these offices are unobtrusive and managed by limited
AIs or indentured infomorphs. The existence of these
offices, however, is vitally necessary for the contin-
ued happiness and existence of transhumanity. Most
hypercorps also maintain a number of employees in
every large habitat and most of the smaller ones.
   Due to the large number of remaining infomorph
refugees, most Experia media nodes are managed by
indentured infomorphs. These infomorphs monitor
the local news-finding AIs and keeps track of any
important or interesting developments. They also
serve as on-site reporters for any important events
that might occur. While postings in small habitats
are often rather dull, the infomorph usually has a
contract guaranteeing them a morph of their choice
and resleeving in the habitat of their choice in return
for a term of service, which typically ranges from
three to five years.
   Similarly, all but the smallest habitats have Medu-
san Shield or Direct Action offices, where individuals
can hire both security consultants and bodyguards
ranging from simple AIs to highly trained mercenar-
ies in fully-equipped fury morphs. These mercenaries
live on the station and often hire short-term contrac-
tors to help with especially large or difficult assign-
ments. Skilled mercenaries may eventually be hired
full-time by Medusan Shield or Direct Action, but
since contractors are usually given the most danger-
ous and thankless parts of any assignment, many
soon lose interest in hypercorp contract work.
   Other employees working out of local hypercorp
offices range from ecosystem designers to for-hire sci-
entists and technicians to personal financial advisors
to the wealthy and powerful. In important habitats
and planetary settlements, as much as twenty percent
of the population consists of hypercorp employees
or private contractors who are hired on a short-term
basis when the local workload exceeds the capacity
of the regular staff. These hypercorp employees are
in the unique position of having dual loyalties—to
their habitat and to their hypercorp. Despite what
hypercorp propaganda preaches, the two interests do
not always overlap.
   Because of the delays involved in normal com-
munication, local heads of hypercorp offices usually
have a great deal of autonomy, since asking for in-
structions from their superiors on another habitat or
installation requires either dealing with a time-lag or
using expensive qubits for instant QE communica-
tion. As a result, except for the most important or
difficult problems, local directors deal with all local
matters on their own, reporting any unusual or po-
tentially problematic decisions afterwards.

THE OUTER SYSTEM
Out beyond the orbit of Mars, the influence of the
hypercorps and the Planetary Consortium is far more
limited. With the exception of the rigidly authoritarian
Jovian Republic, the inhabitants of the outer system
have considerably more freedom than those living in
the inner system. However, even out here the struggle
between the desire for freedom and the longing for
safety form an important part of the political discourse.

THE LIBERTARIAN AND UTOPIAN LEGACIES
Various forms of anarchism and similar libertarian
ideologies were quite common among the first trans-
humans who settled space in the two decades before
the Fall. Many settlements in the outer system have
inherited this legacy of freedom. The new frontier
opened by space colonization presented a fantastic
opportunity for those with a strong desire to avoid
the authoritarianism of the hypercorp-controlled
inner system and Earth to pursue social organizations
more based in equality and collective action, or even
to simply experiment with new social models. Out
beyond the belt, hypercorp influence was weak and
preoccupied, giving resourceful colonists a chance to
explore their interests unmolested. The more radical
of these elements grew out of or maintained ties to
progressive, radical, and left-wing social movements
and insurgencies on Earth, drawing support where
they could. Others simply stole hypercorp resources
from the inner system, smuggling them to their secret
projects. In a few cases, entire ships or stations mu-
tinied, refusing corporate orders and pursuing their
own path. It was rarely feasible for the hypercorps to
pursue and punish such subversion.
   Even among these libertines, differences existed, so
that those adhering to similar socio-political tenden-
cies tended to group together. Over time these have
developed into four rough groupings: the anarchists
of Locus, the techno-socialists of Titan, the anarcho-
capitalists and mutualists of Extropia, and the no-
madic free-for-all societies of the individualist scum.
These factions form a loose alliance, a united front
against the hypercorps and Jovian Republic—or as
they call it, the Jovian Junta—and a pact for mutual
aid and support, known as the Autonomist Alliance.
   Among the more libertine habitats, the centuries-
old doctrine of “From each according to their ability,
to each according to their need” is a living and vital
philosophy. The ready availability of cornucopia
machines ensures that no one wants, and the use of
reputation systems encourages people to be active par-
ticipants towards the common good. Equitable access
to morphs and augmentations is also available for resi-
dents, though the demand from so many infomorphs
in need of a body means that infugees must contribute
and build up social capital. However, even for an info-
morph, egocasting across the solar system is expensive,
and the Planetary Consortium produces large amounts
of propaganda about the dangers of these habitats to
discourage infugees from considering escape.
   Many autonomists consider themselves to be
engaged in an ideological conflict with the inner
system, a memetic cold war that sometimes extends
to physical actions. Some willingly pursue campaigns
of sabotage and subversion against hypercorp and
other authoritarian affairs, such as smuggling cornu-
copia machines into habitats where such machines
are strictly regulated, like among the Jovian Republic.
The hypercorps and their allies occasionally strike
back, though open conflict is rare. Even though the
inner system and Jovian Republic could field enough
military might to subdue the autonomist factions, an
uneasy detente exists. Rumors abound that the an-
archists have some sort of card in their pocket that
keeps their opponents at bay, perhaps even some
threat of mutually-assured destruction.
   Concerns over security and potential future at-
tacks by the TITANs also impact matters in the outer
system, but most people resist attempts to seriously
restrict their personal freedoms in any manner not di-
rectly related to maintaining their safety. Inhabitants
of the outer system still remember how the old gov-
ernments’ demands of adherence to bioconservativism
and allegiance to distant and often unresponsive lead-
ers did nothing to prevent the Fall from happening,
and that memory fuels their mistrust of those states.
Those powers were undone by failing to deliver what
they promised—when they could not provide the se-
curity that they claimed their authoritarian measures
would bring, the seeds of their defeat in the outer
system were planted.

SPACE FOR EXPERIMENTATION
Both social and political experimentation are common
in many of the smaller habitats of the outer system.
Because collective decision-making is fairly easy in
stations with populations of less than ten thousand,
direct democracy is a common method of government.
A number of ideologically-based habitats have used
this ease of making collective decisions as a way to
get all members to agree to some unusual forms of
government.
   The individual variants that have been tried are
too numerous to list, though they generally fit into
a few general categories. A few relatively small habi-
tats employ limited forms of authoritarianism. Some
have a single leader who has great power, but who is
(ideally) kept from abuse or excess through the use
of limits such as a list of constitutionally-guaranteed
rights or the ability of a relatively small number of
people to call an election or a vote of confidence.
Some colonies using this model have elected dictators
who serve for a limited term, while others are ruled
by a single charismatic leader who transforms their
habitat into a cult of personality.
   Other habitats choose their leaders by random
lot, with every adult who can pass a relatively easy
competency test being eligible to be the colony’s
leader for a period that usually ranges from six
months to five years. A few habitats are governed
by powerful specialized AIs, which in very few
cases are actually hyper-intelligent AGIs or even
seed AIs that the colony has secretly created. Sev-
eral colonies populated by purely informorph or
synthmorph inhabitants use special high-bandwidth
connections to give their members access each
other’s surface thoughts and emotional reactions,
allowing them to hold vast democratic political
meetings where everyone present can feel the gen-
eral emotional reactions of all of the other members
as easily as they can feel their own.
  There are a vast number of different types of gov-
ernment, many of which have never existed before,
moving (and sometimes fumbling) ahead in the outer
system. Some work far better than others, allowing
successful colonies to thrive and making much of the
outer system a vast and complex political laboratory.

KEEPING THE PEACE
Each habitat is responsible for dealing with its in-
ternal affairs. As a result, standards of justice vary
widely from the oppressive police state of the Jovian
Junta to the free market judicial courts of the Extro-
pians in the belt to the community justice policies
of the anarchists out beyond Saturn. Travelers are
strongly encouraged to check up on the legalities and
policies of stations they are visiting so as to avoid
unfortunate incidents, though muses are generally
quite good about maintaining awareness of local
conditions so that they can warn their users before
straying into gray or illegal territory.
   In the inner system, standards of justice and law en-
forcement tend to be uniform and very familiar to the
majority of the population that lived on Earth prior
to the Fall, where most nations had relatively similar
standards of justice. Across the entire solar system,
certain similar standards can be found. Though local
laws may differ, there is widespread respect for the
idea that punishments for religious or ideologically-
based laws only apply to residents. Visitors who vio-
late such restrictions or other minor laws are simply
deported to their home and forbidden to return.
Standards of evidence for criminal investigations are
also common. Modern forensic technology makes col-
lecting and analyzing DNA and other trace evidence
an exceptionally swift and easy process. Likewise,
with almost all habitats having what amounts to total
surveillance of all public places, any potential offenses
committed there can be carefully analyzed.
   Standards of privacy vary widely from one habitat
to another, so during emergencies or crime investi-
gations, law enforcement officials may or may not
have total access to detailed recordings of the events
in any portion of the habitat including recordings
from sensors in private dwellings. In some stations,
law enforcement officials can compel everyone who
might have been present during an alleged crime to
provide downloads of their sensory experiences from
the time of the crime. While individuals can edit their
memories, discrepancies between various people’s
sensory recordings are just another form of evidence.
Requiring sensory downloads from witnesses and
suspects is common practice in habitats controlled
by the Planetary Consortium, the Jovian Republic,
and most hypercorps. However, in most habitats in
the outer system, law enforcement officials have no
access to such records and can only compel sensory
recordings from people who have been charged with
serious crimes.
   The power of modern forensics is such that a suf-
ficiently careful examination of people and places
can often determine the nature of a crime and the
perpetrator(s) with relative ease. Decisions of in-
nocence or guilt rarely rely upon suppositions, cir-
cumstantial evidence, eyewitness testimony or any of
the other notoriously unreliable forms of evidence
common in past centuries. The best way for some-
one to avoid being convicted of a crime is to either
prevent anyone from learning about the crime or
to make certain that no one suspects them as the
perpetrator. Once someone guilty of a crime becomes
a suspect, there is a very significant chance that law
enforcement officers will be able to uncover reliable
evidence connecting them to the crime. However, if
there is no obvious evidence connecting a specific
suspect to a crime, the criminal has a greater chance
of escaping discovery.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
Law enforcement in the solar system consists of a
vast patchwork of separate jurisdictions, occasionally
united by various treaties. Most habitats have signed
the Treaty of Uniform Security that requires either ex-
tradition or on-site trial of criminals who are accused
of especially serious crimes such as attempted habitat
destruction, use of incapacitating infoware (including
basilisk hack attacks), or any attempt to aid the agents
of the TITANs in taking over or destroying a habitat.
Only the Jovian Junta and a few especially antisocial
or anarchic habitats have not signed this treaty, but
many habitats in the outer system maintain the right
to try offenders accused by other habitats rather than
extraditing them. In addition, most habitats require a
significant amount of evidence before they are willing
to extradite one of their residents.
   Outside the Treaty of Uniform Security, there is
nothing remotely resembling a uniform code of jus-
tice and no widely recognized police force. Instead,
each habitat or cluster maintains their own code of
laws and law enforcement officers. In most areas, law
enforcement is a respected and honorable profession
paid for by the government, but in a few, the only
options are private security agencies that only protect
individuals who subscribe to their services. Among
the anarchists and scum, residents are largely re-
sponsible for their own protection, which means they
may be constantly armed when in public (depending
on local conditions). Depending on the stations, the
most someone who is the victim of a crime can do
may be to go after their attacker or post a bounty.
In others, mechanisms exist for community or collec-
tive problem-solving that often involve assembling an
ad-hoc grouping of peers to assess the situation, offer
non-biased judgment, and sometimes pursue collec-
tive action.
   The only widely-accepted law enforcement offi-
cers that attempt to maintain jurisdiction across the
solar system are bonded investigators and security
consultants from companies such as Medusan Shield
or Direct Action. Both organizations have contracts
with various hypercorps and inner system stations to
provide security. However, in the outer system and in
other regions not controlled (directly or indirectly) by
the hypercorps, the status of these officers is far more
tenuous. In habitats that do not have security con-
tracts with their organization, the best these agents
can do is act as bounty hunters.
   Due to extensive stories of excesses in the inner
system, many colonies frown on freelance bounty
hunters—often referred to as ego hunters—and may
ban them entirely. Others allow agents from licensed
security hypercorps to act as ego hunters, but forbid
them from extraditing or otherwise restraining or
punishing the criminals they are pursuing. Instead,
agents are required to turn over evidence so that the
habitat’s own judicial system may hold a trial, in
which case a convicted person may be remanded to
the agent’s custody. Law enforcement officers experi-
ence similar difficulties attempting to apprehend a
suspect who has fled to another habitat.
   Closely allied habitats in the outer system usually
allow full or at least limited legal powers to visiting
law enforcement officers from their allies. There are
also various small private security organizations that
work closely with local law enforcement offices to
provide inter-habitat security between habitats that
are not closely allied. The members of these organi-
zations attempt to maintain sufficiently high rep to
earn the respect of all the habitats with which they
work. They act as both bounty hunters and unbiased
investigators in situations that involve the laws of
several habitats. All of these security companies are
located in the outer system, and none has jurisdiction
extending beyond a relatively limited location, like
the middle belt or the Saturn system. Any such orga-
nizations that attempt to grow larger come into direct
competition with Medusan Shield and Direct Action
and are subsequently either bought out or undercut
and discredited by one or both of these organizations.
   There are also several private bounty hunters and
private investigators, some of whom are highly reli-
able. Others are known for their extreme moral and
ethical flexibility, especially if the pay is sufficiently
high. On some of the autonomist stations and scum
ships, these private contractors can be hired to simply
go on board and abduct or execute a resident as long
as this person has a low enough rep. Attempting to
abduct or kill a respected member of the community,
however, rapidly earns the ire of the entire habitat.
The various small-scale or private security organiza-
tions from the outer system can sometimes pursue
subjects to habitats controlled by the various hyper-
corps or the Planetary Consortium. Doing so requires
background checks, security screenings, and often
moderately large payments.

PUNISHMENT
Among the autonomist colonies, forced exile or repay-
ing the victim with an equitable amount of goods or
labor are the principle punishments for all but the most
heinous crimes (such as attempted mass murder, habitat
destruction, attempting to create seed AIs or similarly
extreme actions). In the collectivist anarchist habitats,
antisocial behavior typically involves expulsion or
penalizing reputation, though solutions that involve
making amends are often pursued over standard pun-
ishments. At the other end of the spectrum, people con-
victed of more serious crimes in the most violent and
lawless habitats are executed and all of their known
backups destroyed. In many others, exceedingly serious
crimes are usually dealt with by giving the criminal a
choice of forced uploading into a humanely outfitted
but closed computer or mandatory personality modi-
fication—assuming that someone has not simply killed
the criminal before they were brought to justice (such
killings are generally treated as matters of self-defense).
Mandatory personality modifications are generally
limited to the absolute minimum necessary to prevent
the individual from repeating similar crimes.
   At the other extreme, punishments in hypercorp-
controlled habitats and settlements controlled by the
Planetary Consortium range from fines paid in either
money or labor to periods of involuntary indentured
servitude ranging from several months to many years.
Violent crimes, especially ones threatening either
important hypercorp employees or the habitat as a
whole, also result in mandatory personality modifica-
tion. Such modifications often include the creation of a
strong sense of loyalty and obedience to the hypercorp.
   Punishments are even more draconic in the Jovian
Republic, where permanent execution and the de-
struction of all backups is the most common punish-
ment for serious crimes against the leaders or large
groups of the populace. Since the rulers of the Repub-
lic are strong bioconservatives, personality editing and
forced uploading are rarely used. Forced indenture is
very common, however, as are more standard forms of
imprisonment. The Republic is one of the last places
in the solar system that has physical prisons.
   The vast majority of other habitats fall somewhere
between these extremes. Punishments for non-violent
crimes consist of enforced repayment, where the of-
fender must work off a debt to their victim or victims
or face more serious punishments. Instead of enforced
indenture, offenders usually must only work between
five and twenty hours a week for their victims and
only need to do so until the crime has been suitably
repaid. The typical repayment is between two and
three times the value of the good or service taken
from the victim.

THE ECONOMY
Leaving aside the struggles of bands of primitives to
survive on the ruins of Earth, all of humanity has at
least some access to the wonders of nanotechnology.
This access is highly variable and the economic ben-
efits it produces can be divided into three broad cat-
egories—the old economy, the transitional economy,
and the new economy.

THE OLD ECONOMY
The old economy is essentially the same sort of indus-
trial consumer capitalism that has been in place since
the late 19th century, a system centered on manufac-
turers who create material goods and sell them to
consumers. Modern manufacturers now make their
goods in cornucopia machines instead of factories, but
the essential pattern is the same one that has existed
for over two hundred years. Due to the high level of
inefficiency and unfairness in this economic system,
poverty is relatively common. The poorest individuals
often face hunger, homelessness, lack of medical care,
and similarly dire problems.
   Ordinary members of this society never have direct
access to cornucopia machines. Instead, they pur-
chase their goods from corporations, governments,
or wealthy individuals who control them. Some old
economy societies have planned economies, where the
corporations or the state determine what options the
citizens may choose or occasionally what goods they
must have. Others claim to have a free market, where
citizens have more options, but the residents must still
pay to obtain goods that are essentially free for the
corporations or government to produce.
   In the present day, almost no one willingly lives in
old economy societies. Very few individuals even visit
such societies. The oppressive Jovian Republic holds
most of the remaining old economy societies in the
solar system. The few other surviving examples are
totalitarian regimes where the wealthy elite maintain
absolute control of all cornucopia machines and pri-
vate ownership of one is a very serious crime. Since
cornucopia machines can be used to create more
cornucopia machines, maintaining strict control over
them requires constant vigilance.
   Residents of old economy societies tend to look at
residents of transitional and new economy societies
with envy, while residents of habitats that use both
transitional and new economies look upon residents
of old economy habitats with a mixture of horror and
pity. Since the Fall, almost a third of the remaining
old economy-based habitats have transformed into
transitional or new economies by various means,
often involving violent revolution. Most social scien-
tists predict that unless there are further catastrophes,
all but the most repressive old economy societies are
almost certain to transform to transitional economies
within twenty to thirty years.
  Old economy societies are unique in that money is
the society’s only acceptable means of exchange. While
reputation networks exist, they are informal and serve
as an unsanctioned means of exchanging favors.

THE TRANSITIONAL ECONOMY
The transitional economy is a far more stable and
easily maintained system than the old economy.
Transitional economies blend old and new economies,
and habitats using this system feature both private
ownership of cornucopia machines as well as public
fabbers and makers that are freely accessible. These
public machines are strictly limited in the goods they
can produce. In addition, the raw materials for vari-
ous complex goods are also strictly regulated. Mars,
Venus, and Luna are all examples of transitional
economies, as is most of the rest of the inner system.
   For the inhabitants of a transitional economy, cre-
ating food, non-smart clothing, furniture, and most
other simple, non-formatible objects is a trivial matter.
However, the public nanofabrication machines can
only create objects that either contain no electronics
at all or contain only simple circuits that report on the
object’s condition and location. Manufacturing any
of these items requires little more than the machine
and a supply of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
silicon, iron, aluminum, and tiny amounts of various
trace materials. All of these materials are sufficiently
abundant that acquiring them is easy and inexpensive.
   Using the elements that are freely available to all
tax-paying citizens, nanofabbers can produce a vast
array of goods like exquisite suits of silk clothing,
tables with the appearance of finely polished ebony
and mahogany, beautiful colored glass goblets, or
painted porcelain tea cups. They can also create a
gourmet dinner and a set of fine plates and cutlery on
which to eat the meal. To pay for the small amounts
of energy and resources needed to create these goods,
all inhabitants pay a small tax.
   Once the usage tax has been paid, food, clothing,
furniture, and similar goods are all free. Raw materi-
als, old, worn-out or unwanted goods, and various
waste products are recycled into new goods. Residents
of transitional economies need never experience
hunger or any of the many other sorts of deprivation
that much of humanity faced before the mid-21st cen-
tury. Additionally, basic medical care is free in almost
all transitional economy societies, to help insure that
the populace is healthy, content, and productive.
   While many goods are freely available, there are
also goods that residents must purchase from corpo-
rations, their government, or other producers. Smart
clothing and smart furniture that can change shape,
color, and pattern, depending upon the user’s wishes,
cannot be manufactured in any of the personal nano-
fabricators. Any goods made from highly durable
composite materials, batteries, electrically-powered
devices including all augmentations, and all nanotech-
nology must be acquired in the same fashion. These
goods are considerably less common as they require
access to an unrestricted nanofabricator and exotic
raw materials.
   Transitional economies tend to be relatively safe
places, since inhabitants cannot manufacture weapons
more dangerous than knives, clubs, or similar primi-
tive armaments. Everything from firearms to plasma
weapons requires restricted cornucopia machines and
exotic materials to manufacture. The proliferation of
these items is strictly controlled.
   Some habitats in the outer system have transi-
tional economies because residents prefer the safety
that comes from centralizing control of potentially
dangerous technologies. Other habitats have transi-
tional economies by default, because they have limited
stocks of many of the more rare elements required
for manufacturing various complex modern tech-
nologies. Regardless of the reason, outsiders from new
economy habitants often see them as somewhat poor
and deprived, while many residents of transitional
economies consider new economy societies both ex-
ceptionally wealthy and somewhat frightening.
   Despite these differences in perception, both eco-
nomic societies have a great deal in common. Food,
clothing, and similar goods are easily available to
all residents. An individual’s status, taste, wealth,
and reputation are measured by the kinds of cloth-
ing, food, and furnishings they possess. While there
are a vast number of templates for different styles of
food and consumer goods, forward-thinking design-
ers develop new designs every month and use copy
protection on these designs to keep them from being
pirated for at least a month or two (and often longer).
As a result, for the first few months after their release,
the only people who can gain access to new designs in
clothing, tableware, food, or similar goods are those
who pay a premium to the designer to download the
templates that allow their cornucopia machine to
manufacture the item.
   Since one way of defining a transitional economy
is a system where both reputation and money are
in widespread use, most have developed ways to ac-
commodate both forms of payment. While residents
primarily use money for purchasing goods, purchas-
ing cornucopia machine templates involves rep,
especially among residents who regularly visit new
economy societies or have significant contacts there.

THE NEW ECONOMY
Slightly less than forty percent of the human popula-
tion lives under some version of what social scientists
refer to as the new economy. In the outer system, alter-
native economies are becoming increasingly rare. New
economies are much better than old or transitional
economies at supporting a decentralized populace,
which has led to more than half of all habitats and
settlements adopting this model.
   In new economy societies, individuals can freely
manufacture and use almost anything they want, as-
suming they can acquire the correct templates and
raw materials. As a result, the residents’ need for food,

clothing, medical care, information access, and other
basic needs are all easily met. However, there are still
items of value that individuals work very hard to obtain.
Though these are commonly described as “post scarcity”
societies, some types of scarcity remain very real.
   In most new economy habitats, common goods
are freely available to all residents—or at least to
all residents who meet certain criteria. These criteria
usually take one of two forms: citizenship or public
works. In wealthy and prestigious habitats, free access
to all common goods is offered to residents who have
official citizenship. Citizenship can be earned in a
variety of ways, but the most common involves either
being considered a strategic asset due to some singular
expertise, performing an exceedingly valuable service
to the habitat, or working for the habitat for some
period of time. Once an individual is a citizen, the
energy, living space, and raw materials they use in the
course of their daily lives are all freely available.
  In many collectivized habitats, residents are ex-
pected to pull their weight by contributing to ongo-
ing public works in the habitat, typically requiring
between four and eight hours every week. Depending
on the nature of the colony, this work may be selected
by the government, the collective syndicates that
oversee the management of resources, or by a high
rep individual who controls access to large amounts
of energy and raw materials. Unless someone has
especially valuable skills, this labor is often dull but
safe work that can be done more easily by humans
than AIs, such as checking the habitat for flaws and
performing maintenance tasks.
  Assuming an individual has acquired citizenship
or put in their share of work for the collective well-
being of the station, they will have access to a supply
of energy and raw materials that allows them to use
their cornucopia machines to manufacture what they
need. Visitors are generally also allowed access, though
anyone staying long is expected to contribute to the
habitat if they don’t want to see their reputation slashed.

VALUE AND SCARCITY IN NEW ECONOMY SOCIETIES
While basic citizenship allowances cover most necessi-
ties and even some luxuries, the allowance has limits.
With the allowance, individuals receive a quota of
goods and energy they can use every day. This usage
is impressively lavish by 20th century terms, allowing
residents to create a dozen suits of clothing and pro-
vide food for half a dozen people every day. Creating
elaborate food, furniture, and tableware to serve a
party of a dozen people is within the means of any in-
dividual. However, doing the same thing for a party of
two hundred people is outside the bounds of the basic
allowance.
   Individuals who wish to exceed their basic citizen-
ship allowance can either use rep to obtain more
access to resources and energy, or they can pool
their resources with others to accomplish their goals.
There are many goods that are fairly complex to
create—including many of the best morphs and highly
specialized and intricate pieces of gear like advanced
augmentations—that exceed the resources available in
a basic citizenship allowance.
   The allowance also limits the amount of travel that
residents can easily undertake. Residents of most new
economy habitats own good quality spacesuits, and
many can use their rep to create a small and very
minimally equipped travel pod to travel to a nearby
habitat. However, even the smallest actual spacecraft

> IRREPRODUCIBLE GOODS (FIXME)

are far too large and difficult to create to be available
on an ordinary citizenship allowance, or even on the
amount of rep an ordinary individual can acquire in a
reasonable amount of time.
   In addition to large-scale uses of resources and
difficult-to-manufacture goods, there are goods that
are intrinsically scarce, such as relics of Earth and
handmade goods. While exact copies of everything
from the Mona Lisa to a pressed daisy are exception-
ally easy to acquire, genuine physical relics of Earth
are prized possessions. The vast majority of refugees
could take nothing with them, but almost everyone
wishes to have some token to remind them of Earth. A
single dried flower, coin, or piece of stone from Earth
can be exchanged for almost any morph or other
good that is moderately difficult to create. Actual
historical artifacts, like a famous person’s hat or au-
tograph, is worth far more, as are original works of
art by famous artists. Two years ago, one of the last
three remaining paintings by Leonardo da Vinci was
traded for a large and well-equipped spacecraft, and
a small piece of the Liberty Bell was traded for both
a custom-designed morph and a fully outfitted one-
hectare villa in one of the more prosperous habitats
orbiting Saturn.
   While less expensive than Earth relics, handmade
goods also command a high price and are in great
demand by the wealthy. Though most people cannot
distinguish between a fine wine grown on one of
the Martian vineyards and a duplicate of the same
wine produced using an average cornucopia machine,
some connoisseurs claim they can taste the difference.
There is also much prestige to be gained by serving
hand-grown food. As a result, while anyone can drink
nanofabricated wine, hand-produced wine is a rare
good that can only be enjoyed by a few, and thus
it commands a moderately high price. In almost all
cases, handmade goods are expensive because of their
rarity and because many people enjoy the status as-
sociated with owning and using them.
   There are three other items that are scarce and
are thus quite valuable: living space, skilled sentient
labor, and novelty. The majority of humanity lives in
standard-sized dwelling units, which typically range
from one hundred cubic meters on smaller or poorer


habitats to two hundred cubic meters on wealthy
and prosperous habitats. Since each cubic meter of
a habitat must be manufactured and the process of
manufacturing or expanding a habitat is far from
simple, space is at a premium. The only exceptions
to this scarcity are on Europa and Mars, which can
be inhabited by properly adapted morphs without
the necessity of complex life support or the danger of
vacuum waiting just outside every exterior wall. As
a result, owning a larger dwelling space in a habitat
is worth a significant amount, and large villas and
private asteroids are luxuries possessed by only the
highest rep individuals.
   While transhuman labor has become relatively
cheap due to the large number of infugees who must
sell their services or indenture themselves to obtain
morphs and habitat space, skilled labor is far more
expensive. Buying a unique custom morph design, for
example, crafted by a skilled biogeneticist, can cost as
much as a small spacecraft depending on how much
this morph deviates from standard models. The same
is true for everything from custom-designed clothing
to complex pieces of technology designed for a single
specific usage. While the actual manufacturing costs
of these items is no more expensive than any other
similar item, the time and effort needed to design
them can make them exceedingly expensive.
   The final commodity that is both scarce and valu-
able is novelty. While anyone can drink a fine wine
or wear a wide range of designer clothing, other
commodities are kept deliberately scarce. Cutting-
edge fashion, new music, and even haute nosh (bold,
exclusive snack food designs) are harder to find be-
cause the templates needed to manufacture them are
encrypted and cannot be copied. The copy protection
used on the templates for newly created goods auto-
matically expires within three years at most, and most
habitats reduce this to one year. In addition, this copy
protection is never perfect; someone always manages
to create pirated versions of these new goods within
two to six months. However, from the time templates
are created until the time that someone pirates them,
these items are only available to individuals who are
willing and able to pay for them. Popular new tem-
plates command a good price in the new economy,

%%% txt/067.txt
and a large number of transhumans make their living
designing and marketing such templates.

THE ECONOMY AND INFOMORPH REFUGEES
During the last phase of The Fall and the evacuation
of Earth, more than four hundred million refugees
were uploaded and egocast to orbital databanks. From
there, infomorph refugees were beamed to databanks
throughout the solar system. They were forced to flee
Earth without any of their possessions, even their
bodies. Instead, they became infomorphs who had
nothing beyond their minds and memories—the most
destitute group of refugees ever to exist in human his-
tory. In the years since the Fall, large numbers of these
infugees have been resleeved. Anyone with valuable
skills was first to gain a morph, followed by anyone
with friends or relatives already living in orbit who
could take responsibility for the person’s resleeving.
  Those two groups accounted for only half of the
refugees. The remaining found themselves in a far
more difficult situation. Lacking either personal con-
tacts or vital skills, they had no one else to help them.
In the first few years, many of these infugees signed
contracts promising their labor or other services in
return for resleeving and a guarantee of some form
of income sufficient to support them. Because of the
critical labor shortages in the first five years after the
Fall, another thirty percent of the refugees managed
to regain bodies (usually cheap synthmorphs). These
indentured servants performed all manner of critical
tasks, ranging from scavenging ruined habitats for
useful devices to mining or asteroid herding. Others
became servants or bodyguards for the rich, or per-
formed less moral services for criminal syndicates.
Most took on orbital construction jobs, helping to
construct the new habitats that would eventually
become their home. Some infugees found work per-
forming services like data-mining, monitoring auto-
mated factories, or other jobs that could be done by
infomorphs. After the Fall, infomorphs were used to
take over numerous tasks previously handled by AGIs,
who were no longer trusted.
   Unfortunately, some infomorph refugees made bad
or unlucky deals and ended up working for years only
to find that their employer either kept finding ways to
delay or reduce the payment or vanished before they
delivered on their promise. As a result, slightly more
than twenty percent of the original infomorph refu-
gees remain infomorphs; some by choice, but most be-
cause they have not been able to acquire the means to
resleeve themselves or are still working long contracts
to gain their morph. The problem with obtaining
bodies for these infugees goes beyond simply provid-
ing a new morph for resleeving; living beings require
living space as well as a steady supply of consumables.
For this reason, many infugees have been morphed in
synthetic shells and housed in areas inhospitable to
biomorphs, such as the unenclosed portions of Venu-
sian aerostats. With space in short supply, the waiting
list for infugees looking for a habitat to call home is
quite long.
   Both the hypercorps and the Planetary Consor-
tium were quick to make use of this vast labor pool,
especially on Mars. Mars has large amounts of open
space and resources and is sufficiently close to hab-
itable that Mars-adapted morphs like the ruster are
inexpensive to create. As a result, the Planetary Con-
sortium has been responsible for the employment of
almost half of all remaining infomorph refugees.
For the past decade, the vast majority of infomorph
refugees who want bodies have found that indentur-
ing themselves to the Planetary Consortium or one
of the associated hypercorps involved in Martian
terraforming is the most reliable way to find both
a morph and housing, since both are guaranteed
at the end of the contract. The work involved is
particularly difficult, however, and the contracts are
normally quite long. The Planetary Consortium is

%%% txt/068.txt
also particularly adept at adding charges that pro-
long indenture—though most indentures carry five
to twenty year contracts, in reality these indentures
typically last between eight and twenty-five years;
some go on even longer. This large population of in-
dentured servants on Mars—many of them now free
and resleeved—is becoming a force in its own right,
adhering to the Martian wilds and rural areas and
disdaining the elite hypercorp domes. Adopting the
name Barsoomians from an old Earth fiction series,
this resentful lower class is increasingly becoming a
thorn in the Planetary Consortium’s side.
   Even though it is highly automated, terraforming
and agricultural work on Mars is both tedious and
physically demanding labor. Indentured employees
are regularly sent into the regions that were most
affected by the Fall. As a result, these employees oc-
casionally face attacks by life forms mutated by the
TITANs, nanotech war-swarms, or similar still-active
and dangerous exotic technologies. Indentured em-
ployees are not charged for damage to or destruc-
tion of their morphs caused by such dangers, but the
experience of even reversible death from such causes
is highly traumatic.
   Other refugees found that they enjoyed life as
infomorphs, reveling in complex simulspaces and
otherwise living up the virtual life. Some found work
that paid for the ability to egocast throughout the
solar system. Ten years after the Fall, there is a thriv-
ing infomorph culture. While exact data is difficult to
obtain, many researchers believe that at least a third
of all current infomorph refugees have no plans to
place themselves into a morph, instead enjoying the
freedom of virtual existence. Especially in the outer
system, these infomorphs have become increasingly
involved in habitat politics; many habitats have of-
ficials who are infomorphs. Most researchers predict
this infomorph culture will increasingly diverge from
physical cultures as time progresses.

THE CLANKING MASSES
With so many infugees acquiring cheap synthmorph
shells—particularly cases and synths—and being
unable to afford anything better, synthmorphs have
become associated with poverty throughout the solar
system. This lowest strata of the poor are often referred
to as “the clanking masses,” and compose one-sixth
of the transhuman population. Most of these people
strongly desire to acquire a biomorph, even if it is only
a splicer or worker pod. As a result of their presence,
however, many synthmorphs are now viewed with
distaste, especially in elite social circles. Even those
who have expensive, lovely, custom-designed synthetic
morphs fitted with all of the latest augmentations are
considered to be eccentrics with poor taste.
  The social stigma against synthmorphs is strength-
ened by the fear that, in the event of another attack
by the TITANs, their robotic shells could be rapidly
co-opted to become a deadly TITAN-controlled army.
This has led to some habitats going so far as to active-
ly segregate their synthmorph populations, rational-
ized by the fact that synthmorphs can easily inhabit
unheated and unpressurized portions of various habi-
tats. This segregation and social stigma, however, has
produced the beginnings of an emergent synthmorph
culture. There are already numerous habitats where
all of the inhabitants are sleeved in synthetic shells
and conventional life support exists only for the few
visitors wearing biomorphs.



HABITATS
With Earth now uninhabitable, transhumanity sur-
vives in a variety of off-world habitats. There are two
major types of these habitats: settlements on planets
or large moons, such as those on Luna, Mars, Venus,
Europa, or Titan, and space habitats that are built on
or near an asteroid or other useful source of raw ma-
terials. Most of these space habitats spin themselves
to provide gravity, with Earth and Mars gravity being
the two most common choices. There are also a large
number of zero-g or microgravity habitats, consisting
of either non-spinning habitats or stations built into
small asteroids or moons.

PLANETARY SETTLEMENTS
The Martian and Lunar city-states and other plan-
etary settlements contain environments most familiar
to refugees from Earth. This similarity is one reason
that two-thirds of all infomorph refugees live on
Mars, Luna, or Titan. The exact type of settlements
depends on the planet or moon on which they are
located, with some being far more similar to Earth
cities than others. Most Lunar settlements, like those
on Ganymede, Mercury, Titan, and Callisto, consist
of a network of subsurface tunnels and chambers ex-
cavated with plasma drills. These tunnel settlements
differ slightly from one world to the next. In most
of these tunnel cities, the floors of all open areas
and many dwellings are composed of genetically-
modified grass designed for both comfort and dura-
bility, with light panels covering the ceiling providing
bright full-spectrum lighting.
  A few of these buried cities further enhance their
natural appearance with the addition of trees and, in
some cases, specially engineered ecosystems, in both
public areas and private dwellings. A few of these
urban tunnel forests and jungles are home to numer-
ous flowering vines and bright tropical butterflies.
In a small number of settlements on both Titan and
Luna, colonies of small monkeys and parrots with
metabolisms and habits modified for modern ideas
of cleanliness and sanitation thrive, giving some of
these tunnel cities the feel of a buried jungle.
  All of the older or more prosperous tunnel cities
also contain large open areas that are typically be-
tween one and twenty hectares, with ceilings at least
ten meters high. Some are parks, others are public

%%% txt/069.txt
plazas, but all offer the residents of the tunnel cities
a chance to experience open spaces. Also, with the
exception of Mercury, all of these tunnel cities are on
moons where gravity is no more than one-sixth of a g.
Some of these open spaces are constructed with roofs
between thirty and one hundred meters high and are
designed so that residents can use them for flying by
strapping on a pair of specially-designed wings.
   The cloud cities of Venus are among the most un-
usual habitats in the solar system. Their exotic nature
is enhanced by the chance to observe the many re-
cently introduced floating and flying life forms modi-
fied to live in the clouds. Though located almost fifty
kilometers above the most deadly environment in the
solar system, life in these cloud cities is among the
most Earth-like anywhere in the solar system, with
gravity, temperatures, and atmospheric pressure all
being very near normal Earth levels.
   By contrast, the settlements on Mars look the most
like the cities of lost Earth, built on the surface rather
than underground or in the skies. Some of the more
recent settlements are designed for use by inhabitants
in ruster morphs or synthmorphs and feature no life
support. Older Martian cities and other settlements
are typically covered with low domes of flexible poly-
carbonate and filled with a completely breathable, if
somewhat low pressure, atmosphere. Some, however,
are collections of sealed skyscrapers, connected by
skywalks and tunnels. If current terraforming efforts
continue on schedule, the last sealed Martian cities
will be opened to a Martian atmosphere breathable
by all morphs within sixty years.
   The most unusual planetary settlements are the
ocean cities of Europa. These are among the most
exotic locations in the entire solar system and are
quite disorienting for individuals not used to un-
derwater cities. From a distance, most appear to be
complex Christmas tree ornaments hanging down one
hundred meters or more below the ice crust above. A
few are built deeper, plunging under the icy surface
near the various hydrothermal vents that host the
native Europan life clusters.
   Many of the residents of the Europan cities find
them familiar because they previously lived in one of
the underwater cities on Earth and so were used to
both the conditions and to living in an aquatic-adapt-
ed body. Europan cities all contain sealed buildings
with normal atmosphere, both because some activi-
ties work best in air instead of water and because the
cities often host visitors without gills. However, these
regions make up only ten percent or so of most of
these cities. The remainder looks vaguely similar to
many zero-g habitats, except that the structures are
considerably sturdier and are located underwater.
Buildings are designed to be accessible in all three di-
mensions, so going from one floor to another usually
involves swimming out a large opening in the wall
and down a level. In almost all of these aquatic cities,
large fusion generators heat the surrounding water, so
that the entire city exists in a region of water that is
far warmer than the surrounding frigid Europan sea.

SPACE HABITATS
With the exception of the private habitats of the
wealthy and powerful described below, the vast ma-
jority of space habitats hold between twenty-five hun-
dred and one million inhabitants. Almost two-thirds
of these habitats were built during the first seven years
after the Fall, when huge portions of the system’s
surviving infrastructure were used to create habitats
suitable for hundreds of millions of infugees.
  During this era, several thousand torus habitats
and cluster colonies were created throughout the solar
system. Many of these habitats were created by auto-
mated mining machinery that had been repurposed
to create colonies. Due to the limitations of these au-
tomated mining rigs, most these habitats were small,
holding between one thousand and one hundred
thousand inhabitants. Twenty percent of the system’s
inhabitants live in such habitats. During the past
decade, various small organizations, cults, and sub-
cultures have left the larger habitats they lived in and
created their own small habitats, few of which were
designed to hold more than ten thousand residents.
  The development of the new nanotech Hamilton
cylinders has lead to a new interest in large habi-
tats and in habitats that can easily expand in size
to accommodate an increasing population. The ex-
pense and difficulty involved in expanding existing
habitats or building new ones is one of the principle
reasons that more than forty million infomorph
refugees still do not posses morphs. Although none
of the existing Hamilton cylinders has finished grow-
ing, they are both highly regarded by their residents.
This same technology is also likely to produce a
low-cost method for creating small habitats, where
the creators merely need to seed an asteroid with the
appropriate advanced nanotech generators and wait
a few months.

SCUM BARGES
At the opposite extreme from the Hamilton cylinders
are the infamous scum barges. Most are spacecraft
built before or during the Fall that were used to
help with the early stages of the evacuation, ferrying
people away from the doomed Earth. Many of these
refugee ships were unable to find anywhere to unload
their human cargo, becoming a sort of permanent
traveling refugee camp, sometimes succumbing to
mutinies. They eventually joined up with pre-existing
scum ships and swarms, adopting their nomadic, free-
wheeling, anarchistic lifestyle. In contrast to egocast-
ing or the faster and more efficient fusion drive ships,
so-called scum barges offer a floating city alternative
to space travel. These ships function as roving black
markets and carnivals of the bizarre—lawless zones
where anyone can find whatever they want or need for
the right rep or price.

%%% txt/070.txt
  Most scum barges have fusion-powered plasma
drives and hold between two hundred and five
thousand inhabitants. The worst barges are excep-
tionally overcrowded, with aging life-support sys-
tems struggling to maintain a breathable (but still
foul-smelling) atmosphere under the strain of too
many passengers. The larger and more prosperous
scum barges are often fitted with various modern
conveniences, including large cornucopia machines
and vast stores of pirated manufacturing templates.
Some are thriving utopianist enclaves, while others
are mobile dens of smugglers and thieves that would
have been destroyed long ago except for the fact that
large and powerful organizations find their existence
occasionally useful. Living conditions on the scum
barges range from overcrowded refugee camps to
thriving, egalitarian, but non-wealthy anarchist
enclaves, to relatively modern habitats outfitted in
barbaric splendor by highly successful organized
crime gangs.

A DIVERSITY OF FLOATING WORLDS
The use of cornucopia machines and smart materials
means that the interiors of all but the poorest and
most destitute habitats can be reshaped according
to the whims of their inhabitants. When the number
of inhabitants is small enough or their aesthetics are
uniform enough to all share the same tastes, the re-
sults can be both unique and strange. Large-scale fads
occasionally sweep through even the largest and most
cosmopolitan habitats, making some of the bigger
colonies almost as odd.
   Several habitats closely resemble terrestrial jungles,
with an entire rainforest canopy growing from the
slowly rotating outer shell and all dwellings and
pieces of high technology nestled in the branches
or hollows of these vast gene-engineered trees. In
these living marvels, genetically engineered monkeys,
iguanas, and tree sloths wander amidst the inhab-
itants—some of these creatures are wild animals,
while others are controlled by AI servitors and act
as maintenance or observation drones. Some habi-
tats resemble other scenes from old Earth, including
more than a dozen water-filled habitats hosting some
of the aquatic inhabitants of the now-destroyed
underwater cities. In most of these marine habitats,
the actual buildings are either placed amidst a living
coral reef filled with fish and other creatures or are
actually built into the coral reef itself. There are
many other habitats duplicating other environments,
such as Afrique—a large Cole habitat with a popula-
tion of two hundred thousand, where the habitat is
made to resemble the African savanna. In Afrique,
the two ends of the habitat are shaped into snow-
capped mountains, and the inhabitants mostly live in
several large cities built in the savannah.
  While nostalgia for Earth is a powerful force in
habitat design, there are many other options. A few
exotic habitats resemble fantastic cities from various
vidgames or older forms of entertainment, including a
handful of small and eccentric habitats where the in-
habitants all appear as strange humanoid alien beings.
In many, the inhabitants have cosmetically modified
themselves to fit in with the setting.
   One of the most common differences between small
and large habitats is that the residents of smaller
stations often share a common ideology or sense of
aesthetics, and so are far more eccentric. Some of the
more unusual habitats range from dimly lit, spooky
landscapes filled with perpetually leafless trees, thick,
continually regenerating cobwebs, and other similar
macabre touches to gleaming colonies that are shining
citadels of quartz and steel. Some are huge intercon-
nected arcologies where any sort of personal privacy
is rare, while in others every family or even every
person has a separate dwelling that is rarely seen by
outsiders. Since the populations of these stations are
relatively small and the vast majority are not major
economic centers, travel to and from these smaller
habitats is infrequent, which further increases their
insularity and idiosyncrasies.

THE LARGEST HABITATS
Extropia, the huge Martian city-states, and some
of the largest Lunar stations hold between one mil-
lion and twenty million inhabitants. There are many
smaller settlements containing between one hundred
thousand and one million residents. These habitats
are considerably less idiosyncratic and exotic than the
smaller habitats. Almost all contain a cosmopolitan
and diverse population from a wide variety of sub-
cultures. Because of this diversity and the difficulty of
forming any sort of consensus with a large population,
these settlements tend to be reminiscent of the cities
of Earth. All of them have their own unique character
and feel, but the differences between one habitat and
another are rarely overwhelming. In addition, all of
these stations are large enough to hold offices for all
of the major hypercorps, who further promote uni-
formity by providing the same services from identical
hypercorp offices. Since most of these habitats are
major centers of commerce, travel between them is
frequent, so there are various facilities for travelers
such as hotels and sports clubs that help reduce the
disorientation of travel by offering identical experi-
ences, regardless of their location.

MICROGRAVITY HABITATS
Zero-g habitats are very different from those that
use rotational gravity. Most consist of networks of
tunnels drilled through the asteroids—similar to the
tunnel cities of Luna and Titan—but some are consid-
erably more exotic. Like most other habitats, almost
all microgravity colonies are built in, on, or next to
one or more asteroids containing a large amount of
useful raw materials. They typically feature a gravity

%%% txt/071.txt
less than 0.01 g that has very little effect on the daily
lives of the inhabitants. Near-weightless environments
allow for some interesting and unusual habitat designs
as there is no up or down, enabling the creation of
structures that would be too fragile even in low grav-
ity. The habitats of Nova York (p. 97) and Nguyen’s
Compact (p. 103) are both examples of this, among
many others.

PRIVATE HABITATS
The most rare and exotic of all of the types of habitats
are the luxurious private ones owned by exceedingly
wealthy or high rep individuals. Most private habitats
are small but still give each of the residents several
thousand cubic meters of personal space.
  A typical private habitat is either a cylinder one
hundred fifty meters in diameter (the minimum nec-
essary to produce Mars gravity at a rate of rotation
slow enough to avoid problems in all morphs) and
between fifty and two hundred meters long, or a
zero-g sphere one hundred to two hundred meters
in diameter. These habitats are always tethered to
a small collection of raw materials, consisting of
chunks of silicate, nickel-iron, and water-containing
carboniferous asteroids with a mass equal to at
least that of the habitat. The majority of private
habitats are inhabited by between half a dozen and
three dozen morphs, some or most of which may
be AI servants or, on rare occasions, indentured
servants. Life in a private habitat is exceptionally
lavish. Almost every surface is made of formatible
smart materials and there are several large general-
purpose cornucopia machines available for the use
of every resident.
   By using these nanofabricators and the smart mate-
rials to their fullest, residents can completely change
the interior of the habitat in only a day or two—trans-
forming a sterile and crystalline array of shining metal
and glass buildings into a thriving forest, inhabited by
a variety of wild animals. The mesh is filled with vids
and XPs about the lives of the most famous residents
of the solar system. Almost everyone has seen the in-
terior of one of these vast space mansions many times,
though only a tiny percentage of the inhabitants of
the solar system will ever have a chance to actually
visit such a location. Many gatecrashers, scavengers
who travel to Earth, and others who engage in simi-
larly daring endeavors hope to be able to obtain infor-
mation or objects sufficiently valuable to allow them
to retire to their own private habitat.

FACTIONS
One would have thought a cataclysmic event such
as the Fall would bring the surviving elements of
transhumanity closer together, jointly dedicating
themselves to the repopulation of the solar system
and continued prosperity. Instead, the remoteness and
physical isolation of transhuman colonies and habitats
stretched across the solar system, as well as the ef-
fects emerging technologies have had on transhuman
economies and social lives, have promoted the evolu-
tion of a wide spectrum of philosophies, agendas, and
political models.

THE HYPERCORPS
To some economists, the Fall and the numerous crises
that predated it on Earth can be viewed as an extinc-
tion event, the end of the line for the massive trans-
national megacorp dinosaurs, financial giants that
supported their monolithic frameworks on outdated
economic models and industrial technologies. The hy-
percorps are their evolutionary descendants: slimmer,
faster, meaner, and more flexible, eagerly embracing
the possibilities of new technologies and never afraid
to toss the old aside to take advantage of the new. It
was the hypercorps that drove humanity’s expansion
into space and who continue to push the technological
envelope, guiding transhumanity towards new hori-
zons—always with profit as their driving goal.
   Most hypercorps are decentralized, non-asset-
based legal entities. Complete automation, advanced
robotics, morph technology, and cornucopia ma-
chines allow the hypercorps to abstain from mass
employment for labor or production services. The
need for physical labor has mostly been reduced
to tasks associated with habitat construction or
deep space mining. Infomorphs and AIs are heavily
employed (or more accurately, owned) as drone op-
erators or virtual workers, and many administrative
tasks are performed online via augmented reality,
virtual private networks, and simulspace nodes.
Some hypercorps are in fact entirely “virtual,” with
no physical assets and each employee acting as a
mobile office. A few major hypercorps literally con-
sist of only a dozen transhuman personnel. Though
some hypercorps are massive and diversified, most
specialize in particular fields or services. This results
in both an intricate system of partnerships to de-
velop, produce, and market products and services
and a large-scale tendency to internally contract
special services from other hypercorps. Many hy-
percorps also pool their resources and talent into
cooperative research initiatives, project centers, or
shared habitats.
   Most hypercorps are traditional capitalist in out-
look, though many have adopted alternative business
philosophies and management models. This might
include basing decisions on internal forecast market
trends, groupthink consensus models, or ditching
management entirely in favor of staff polling/voting
initiatives that statistically fare better. A few are anar-
cho-capitalist companies originating from Extropian
enclaves, though these often suffer from a bias when
making deals with inner system powers.
   The solar system boasts thousands of hypercorps;
a few of the more prominent and interesting are
noted below.

COGNITE
Major Industries: Cognitive Science, Mental Im-
plants, Psychosurgery, Nootropics
Major Stations: Thought (Venus orbit), Phobos
(Mars moon)
A pioneer in the field of cognitive science, Cognite
(pronounced cog-neet) drives forward the cutting
edge of research into understanding the transhuman
mind. Most well-known for their mental augmenta-
tions and the original menton morph design, Cognite
also specializes in psychosurgery and nootropics.
Their elitist and aloof image was not aided by their
scandalous involvement with the projects to raise ac-
celerated growth children that became known as the
Lost generation (p. 233), nor rumors that they engage
in research involving TITAN-influenced incapacitating
input attacks. Nevertheless they remain a key member
in the Planetary Consortium.

COMET EXPRESS (COMEX)
Major Industries: Courier Services, Shipping,
Logistics
Major Stations: Nectar (Luna), Olympus (Mars)
Comet Express specializes in delivery services, inter-
stellar logistics, supply chains, and shipping. They
maintain a presence on almost every transhuman
habitat in the solar system, often via local subcontrac-
tors. Despite the wonders of nanofabrication, many
resources must still be imported. ComEx focuses on
managing supply and trade routes and making sure
physical shipments reach their destinations. For that
purpose, ComEx maintains orbital hubs equipped
with slingshot accelerators at strategic waypoints

%%% txt/073.txt
throughout the system and a fleet of cargo vessels
and courier drones. For reasons unknown to the
public, ComEx is viewed with hostility by the Jovian
Republic, who have standing orders to shoot down
ComEx vessels.

DIRECT ACTION
Major Industries: Security Services, Military
Contracting
Major Stations: Hexagon (Earth-Luna L5)
Descended from the remnants of several pre-Fall
national military forces and private military contrac-
tors, this hypercorp made a name for itself in the
period immediately following the Fall, where they
helped manage refugee populations among various
habitats and vessels while shattering any sign of
unrest immediately and with full force. Direct Action
today is known for its highly-efficient shock troops
and superior combat morphs, providing security and
public police services to self-governing habitats or
hypercorp installations. Shifting political alliances
between habitat clusters, corporate rivalry, and the
constant fear of TITAN agents cater to Direct Action’s
paranoia-inducing marketing. The corporation main-
tains several habitats as physical training facilities and
armament depots.

ECOLOGENE
Major Industries: Environmental Systems, Genetics
Major Stations: McClintock (Mars orbit)
Ecologene specializes in living systems, environmental
genetics (with a specialty in insects), smart animals,
bio-architecture, and environmental nanotech. They
design and maintain the ecosystems inside numerous
habitats and tunnel colonies. One of Ecologene’s no-
table projects is building and maintaining a massive
genetics archive of all life forms, though this endeavor
was nearly crippled by the Fall. For unknown reasons,
Ecologene seems to be favored by the Factors. Some
speculate that Ecologene has some sort of blackmail
material in hand, while others believe Ecologene is
trading away transhumanity’s genetic secrets in ex-
change for a few xeno-tech gifts.

EXOTECH
Major Industries: Uploading, AIs, Electronics,
Software
Major Stations: Starwell (Main Belt)
Often regarded as the personal technocratic pulpit of
the infamous media mogul Morgan Sterling, Exotech
emerged from the Fall almost unscathed, any signifi-
cant losses absorbed by corporate assets in peripheral
market segments, while ruthlessly buying out troubled
competitors or think tanks unable to adapt to the
transitioning economy. Nowadays, Exotech remains a
predominant designer of high-end electronics, AIs, and
mesh presence software systems. ExoTech also contin-
ues to pursue an uncompromising progressive agenda
with its research in mind emulation, uploading, and
resleeving, as well as infomorph ego simulation.
Rumors persist that ExoTech continues to carry out
research and even production of AGIs.

EXPERIA
Major Industries: Media (AR, VR, XP), News,
Entertainment, Memetics
Major Stations: Elysium (Mars)
Living up to its name, Experia dominates the solar
system’s news, media, and entertainment market
segments, generating controversy not only with its
publicly expressed pro-AI stance or inviting an AGI
to its board of directors, but also by proficient use of
hyperviral marketing and sophisticated XP-program-
ming. Another core segment is the production of edu-
cational XP and infomorph or AI tutors, some of the
latter regularly ascending to pop-culture icon status.
Experia is the Planetary Consortium’s prime authority
on designing and deploying customized viral memes,
developed to counter anything posing a threat to the
Consortium’s interests. The corp has automated nodes
and VR centers on many habitats throughout the solar
system, and it contracts thousands of freelance lifel-
oggers as live, roving, citizen journalistas. Claims by
some infomorphs that Experia has illegally subjected
indentured infomorphs to never-ending simulation
experiments for forecasting and intelligence analysis
purposes remain unsubstantiated.

FA JING
Major Industries: Mining, Energy, Biotech, Industrial
Manufacturing
Major Stations: New Dazhai (Mars)
The industrial giant Fa Jing is a powerhouse in the
mining and energy production markets and also
boasts a remarkable presence in the fields of biotech
and industrial equipment manufacturing. The former
megacorp has quickly adapted to the new economic
environments and reputation-based systems, thanks
partly to its dedication to network building and shar-
ing social responsibility, epitomized in concepts like
dàtóng and guanxi. Often considered insular and
close-minded, its internal communal and protective
mindset is a strong contrast to its manipulating and
monopolist business attitude. Fa Jing is engaged in
mining operations throughout the asteroid belt and
the Trojans and maintains significant corporate assets
on Mars.

GATEKEEPER CORPORATION
Major Industries: Gatecrashing, Research, XP Media,
Exoplanet Colonization
Major Stations: Gateway (Pandora)
Initially born from the merger of several scientific
institutions and their corporate financiers, this hy-
percorp made a name for itself overnight when it
announced the successful decoding of the wormhole
gateway discovered on Saturn’s moon Pandora. Under
the leadership of the eccentric but charismatic xeno-
archeologist Xander Rabin, the consortium funds
gatecrasher explorations through the Pandora gate,
paying a small share of the revenue to the explorers
but otherwise retaining all-encompassing rights on
any discoveries made—as well as the marketing and
distribution of the highly popular gatecrasher XP
recordings. Aside from scheduled explorations, the
consortium offers high-risk gatecrasher scouting and
discovery trips for the bold or desperate, selected
through a random lottery system.

GO-NIN GROUP
Major Industries: Banking, Agritech, Robotics, and
Services
Major Stations: Tsukomo (Luna)
Considered a relic of Earth’s capitalist market
economy, the Go-nin Group is a traditional Japanese
keiretsu, a conglomerate of companies with interwo-
ven relationships and shareholdings, horizontally-
integrated across several industries (and sometimes
vertically-integrated within a business sector as well),
and centered around the long-lived Tamahashi en-
terprise consultancy firm. Tamahashi evolved from
an influential corporate lobby to a diversified bank
holding major equity in the group’s partners; it now
controls the group’s assets and directs the partnership’s
overall business strategy. Through its member corps,
the Go-nin Group has a sizable presence throughout
the entire system and—without dominating a specific
industry—own significant market share in fields such
as banking, agritech, robotics, and services. Any dif-
ficulties in adapting to evolving economic models due
to its rigid structure are compensated by unscrupulous
exploitative behavior and a bottom-line attitude,
earning the group the reputation as the most ruthless
hypercorp of the inner system. Go-nin currently con-
trols a Pandora Gate on Eris (p. 109), secured by a
contingent of ultimate mercenaries.

GORGON DEFENSE SYSTEMS
Major Industries: Miltech, Security, Military
Contracting
Major Stations: Extropia
Gorgon is one of the most significant Extropian
success stories. Based out of the anarcho-capitalist
freehold, Gorgon has become a major name in the
design and manufacture of weapons, vehicles, sensors,
and other defense technologies. Their product range
includes personal weapon systems, spacecraft arma-
ments, and habitat defense systems. While prominent
in the inner system, Gorgon is also one of the main
arms suppliers to autonomist and brinker stations.
Their subsidiary Medusan Shield offers private secu-
rity services in direct competition to Direct Action.
While DirAct is known for its expertly trained sol-
diers, Medusan Shield is known for their elite cadre
of highly trained and aesthetically enhanced female
combat morphs. It is suspected that several promi-
nent assassinations have been the work of agents
contracted through Medusan Shield.

NIMBUS
Major Industries: Electronics, Mesh Systems,
Farcasting, Communications
Major Stations: Octavia (Venus)
Nimbus produces key components for mesh infra-
structure, from spime microradio and sensor sys-
tems to ectos, servers, and laser links. Nimbus also
dominates the network of farcaster links throughout
the system, due to several breakthroughs in this tech-
nology (some claim that Nimbus purchased these
advances from the Factors). Rumors that Nimbus
controls a secret Pandora Gate or that they engage
in illicit ego-smuggling (or even that they are secretly
transferring stolen egos to experimental exoplanet
colonies) regularly circulate through the mesh, but
remain unconfirmed.

OMNICOR
Major Industries: Nanofabrication, Chemicals,
Energy, Anti-Matter
Major Stations: Monolith-3 (Mercury), Feynman (Luna)
A descendant of the pre-Fall megacorporate giant
Monolith Industries, Omnicor specializes in the fields
of nanotech design and fabrication, chemical refining,
alternative fuel, and antimatter research. Omnicor man-
aged to secure research-oriented key assets from its twin
rival Starware in a violent conflict during the Fall, lead-
ing to an ongoing enmity that might be better termed

%%% txt/075.txt
a corporate war. Despite its progressive technological
outlook, Omnicor retains a conservative corporate
structure with strict internal regulations and controls
as a defense against Starware’s repeated infiltration and
sabotage attempts. Among the hypercorp’s major assets
are an antimatter research facility orbiting Mercury.

PATHFINDER
Major Industries: Exoplanet Colonization, Mining,
Research
Major Stations: Ma’adim Vallis (Mars)
Pathfinder is one of the first hypercorps to dive into
galactic expansion, claiming new territories beyond
the Pandora gates and establishing numerous colonies.
Taking advantage of desperate infugees and gatecrash-
ers, Pathfinder offers transportation to an exoplanet
and a new morph in exchange for indentured labor.
The corp has established several off-world mining and
resource exploitation projects, much to the chagrin of
preservationists. Though Pathfinder has but a small
presence in the solar system, it is a frequent target of
eco-terrorist attacks.

PROSPERITY GROUP
Major Industries: Agriculture, Aquaculture,
Pharmaceuticals
Major Stations: Ceres, Lu Xing (Mars)
The Prosperity Group ascended into the hypercorp
ranks before the Fall, meeting the high demand
many new stations had for microgravity agritech,
aquaculture, hydroponics, and other sources of food.
Expanding into pharmaceuticals as well, Prosperity is
considered the lead supplier for the poor man’s food
and drugs. Their cultured faux-meats and protein-
enriched nutrition additives are in high demand. This
corp earned some sympathy when it lost an entire
habitat to some sort of resurgent TITAN outbreak a
few years after the Fall, though some have suggested
this was just a cover story to hide an unfortunate
accident resulting from experimental drug testing on
an unwitting populace.

SKINAETHESIA
Major Industries: Genetics, Cloning, Biotech
Major Stations: Ptah (Mars)
As the leading designer of biomorphs, Skinaethesia
enjoys system wide popularity and respect for its so-
phisticated products, especially high-end customized
models. Best known for its breakthroughs in genetic
engineering and enhancements, the hypercorp’s in-
terest in sophisticated combat morphs or stylized
pleasure pods are lesser known facts and often sold
through a network of seemingly unaffiliated shell cor-
porations or local distributors. Skinaesthesia focuses
on emphasizing environmental adaptations and useful
cybernetic enhancements, increasing transhumanity’s
chances for survival and further prosperity. Experi-
mental morphs are sometimes offered to desperate
infugees for field testing.
SKINTHETIC
Major Industries: Genetics, Cloning, Biotech
Major Stations: Extropia
Skinthetic is also a lead designer of morphs, but with
a much sleazier reputation and not just because of
their anarcho-capitalist roots. Specializing in exten-
sive and often radical bio-modifications, the hyper-
corp pushes the envelope in exotic pod and biomorph
designs under the mantle of morphological freedom.
Bioconservatives have condemned the corporation’s
business practices and ethics and have even leveled
accusations that Skinthetic is experimenting with
xenogenetic materials acquired from the Factors.
Skinthetic’s cavalier attitude actually makes them
popular in many parts of the outer system, and they
are know as the biotech corp to go to if you want
something weird.

SOLARIS
Major Industries: Banking, Insurance, Investments,
Futures Markets, Info Brokerage
Major Stations: None
Solaris is the solar system’s leading banking and fi-
nancial investment hypercorp, dealing in insurances,
info-brokerage, and high-risk investments on cultural
and social experimental speculation. A member of the
Planetary Consortium, Solaris advises many habitats
on regulating their transitional economies. Solaris has
no offices or physical assets; each banker is a mobile
virtual office. Solaris is rumored to maintain a secret
base where the corporation runs simulations on the
development of the entire solar system’s macro-econ-
omy, constantly adjusting its own strategies based
on the dynamics of this big blueprint. Fueling these
rumors, Solaris is known to hire “independent consul-
tants” to tip the balance in politically or economically
profitable high-risk investments.

SOMATEK
Major Industries: Uplifts, Pharming, Pharmaceuti-
cals, Genetics
Major Stations: Clever Hands (Luna)
Somatek is a leader in the art and science of uplift-
ing animal species, pioneering several major brea
throughs in cognitive enhancement and genetic
modification. The hypercorp also engages in extensive
animal pharming—producing and extracting phar-
maceuticals from transgenic critters—and markets
numerous products and services related to smart ani-
mals and chimerical creatures. Despite the educational
and training programs it offers to uplifts and the fact
that much of its workforce consists of uplifts, Somatek
is controversial among mercurials who disapprove of
their methods (which often involve strict controls on
uplift reproduction), the lack of input uplifts are given
in their modifications and development, and the focus
on anthropocentric mind-sets “enforced” on uplifts.)

STARWARE
Major Industries: Robotics, Aerospace Engineering,
Habitat Construction
Major Stations: Korolev Shipyards (Luna), Vesta
(Belt)
Another remnant of the pre-Fall megacorp Monolith
Industries (like Omnicor), Starware is a leading manu-
facturer of robotics, spacecraft fusion drives, satellites,
and entire pre-fab habitats. Despite its financial suc-
cess and resources, Starware’s ongoing blood feud
with Omnicor denies both corporations full member-
ship privileges on the Planetary Consortium. Starware
makes heavy use of AI workers in robotic shells,
having suffered a few too many labor disputes with
disgruntled Lunar workers. In fact Starware grows in-
creasingly unpopular with its Lunar neighbors, and has
been forced to bring in extra security due to frequent
sabotage attempts. Recent negotiations with the Fac-
tors have spurred theories that Starware might be ac-
quiring Factor aid for building a lighthugger starship.

STELLAR INTELLIGENCE
Major Industries: Intelligence, Data Mining, Info
Brokerage, Espionage
Major Stations: Memory Hole Torus (Martian
Trojans)
Born from the ashes of the UN-governed Terran Intel-
ligence Cooperative (TIC), its surviving personnel and
assets were collectively uploaded during the Fall and
quickly regrouped under the name Stellar Intelligence.
Emerging as a virtual collective, most of Stellar’s em-
ployees remain loyal to the corporation and its direc-
tor, the reclusive infomorph known as Syme. Stellar
offers an impressive array of intelligence services,
including data mining, analyst think tanks, retro-
quantification (bringing old secrets/data to light),
memetic mapping, and more. Its services also extend
to surveillance, data theft, espionage, media manipu-
lation, and infiltration. The hypercorp’s specialty is
pre-empting civil insurgencies and preventing political
memes and movements from destabilizing a habitat’s
or sector’s regime. Criticized by civil rights movements


and especially anarchists, Stellar is known to embed
programmed infomorph agents into the local popu-
lation of any oppressive regime that will pay their
price. While many view Stellar as the brainwashing
and secret police arm of the Planetary Consortium,
the hypercorp offers its services to almost any other
faction or individual.

TERRAGENESIS
Major Industries: Terraforming, Ecosystem Manage-
ment, Environmental Data
Major Stations: Caldwell (Vulcanoids), Ashoka
(Mars), Elegua (Earth orbit)
Built from the remains of several pre-Fall South Afri-
can and Southeast Asian corporations who engaged
in geo-engineering projects and sought to relieve
Earth’s ecological crises, TerraGenesis’s expertise is in
developing sustainable biospheres and eco-systems via
aggressive industrialized terraforming. TerraGenesis
is different in that it is a worker-owned cooperative,
with workplace councils in local offices and an elected
cooperative congress handling management. It main-
tains several habitats on Mars and a small number of
research stations in orbit around Earth, collecting data
for simulations of Earth revitalization projects. The
latter initiative is strongly supported—and possibly
financed—by prominent reclaimers. TerraGenesis’s
work on Mars, however, is often targeted by preser-
vationist saboteurs. Thanks to their possession of the
Vulcanoid Pandora Gate (p. 88), the cooperative has a
growing presence on various exoplanets that are ripe
for terraforming or geoengineering.

POLITICAL BLOCS
Transhumanity’s social, cultural, and ideological
diversity, combined with its scattered and isolated
presence in habitat clusters throughout the solar
system, gives rise to a wide range of political memes
and factions advocating equally diverse organizational
models. Many of these have banded together into
larger political entities to further mutual goals and act
in cooperative self-interest.

%%% txt/077.txt
JOVIAN REPUBLIC
Memes: Bioconservatism, Fascism, Security
Main Stations: Liberty (Ganymede)
Exploiting the chaos of the Fall, a group of stations
and habitats were seized in a military coup and the
Jovian Republic was born. Combining terrestrial
South American dictatorship with U.S. American po-
litical lobbyism, this regime quickly brought the entire
Jovian military-industrial complex under its control.
   Widely referred to as the
Jovian Junta by the rest of the
outer system, the Repub-
lic’s authorities hold a
strict bioconservative
stance against many
transhuman scientific
and technological devel-
opments. Exploiting fears
engendered by the Fall, the Re-
public restricts access to sophisti-
cated technologies such as nanofabrication, cloning,
forking, and even uploading, and is one of the few
old economies left in the system. Public communica-
tion channels are subjected to extensive censorship
and travel privileges are extremely limited. Both
uplifts and AGIs are strictly forbidden and treated
as property without civil rights. Diplomatic relations
to progressive factions remain cold; heavily-modified
transhuman emissaries or visitors are viewed with
suspicion at best, or simply denied access. Despite
continuous reports of heinous acts of government
oppression, the Republic’s intimidating military assets
keep any other factions from intervening.

LUNAR-LAGRANGE ALLIANCE
Memes: Reclaiming Earth
Main Stations: Erato (Luna), Remembrance (Earth
orbit)
This small cluster of habitats stationed around Earth’s
Lagrange points and on or in orbit around Luna
formed an alliance of necessity, rather than joint
political or social agendas or cultural roots. In fact,
individual stations are quite diverse and sometimes
polarized, as many of them cling to old Earth cultural
and national identities. Due to their relative proxim-
ity, members share basic resources and services and
have signed mutual assistance agreements in case of
an emergency.
   Before the Fall, many of these habitats were
considered some of the most
infl uential off-Earth bases.
Since the Fall and the
subsequent rise of
the Planetary Con-
sortium, however,
the Lunar-Lagrange
Alliance has become
a second-rate dimin-
ished power, and is
often viewed as conservative, old-fashioned, and
too caught up in romanticizing the past. Lunar-
Lagrange Alliance stations maintain simmering
tensions and an ongoing rivalry with the Planetary
Consortium, particularly those PC colonies on/over
Luna and the Lagrange points. One main source of
contention is the quarantine of Earth, as the Lunar-
Lagrange Alliance is a stronghold for the reclaimer
movement. The Lunar-Lagrange Alliance does,
however, benefit from hypercorp support of its own,
particularly the Go-nin Group, Starware, and the
influential Lunar banking consortiums.
   In addition to scientific research stations, mineral
processing and refinery stations make up the major-
ity of the Alliance’s habitats, dependent on the Lunar
mining and water extraction industries. These stations
took the brunt of the refugee influx during the Fall.
Many remain overcrowded with strained resources,
large masses of impoverished workers, and thriving
criminal syndicates.

MORNINGSTAR CONSTELLATION
Memes: Venusian Sovereignty
Main Stations: Octavia
The system’s newest political bloc, the Morningstar
Constellation is an alliance of aerostat
habitats floating in Venus’s upper atmo-
sphere. Formed after a recent
series of joint vetoes from the
major aerostats against hyper-
corp governance initiatives
intended to limit aerostat
self-governance, the Con-
stellation’s joint political
statement and agenda are still
being discussed. While the
Planetary Consortium views

the formation of this new power bloc with bemused
resentment, the Barsoomians on Mars and the outer
system autonomists view the Venusians as free-think-
ing reformists rather than anti-hypercorp radicals. The
population reportedly enjoys great liberties in morph
and enhancement technologies together with freedom
of expression of social and political ideas. The popu-
lation of Octavia has emerged as the Constellation’s
designated voice.

PLANETARY CONSORTIUM
Hypercorp Council Members: Cognite, Direct
Action, Experia, Fa Jing, Olympus Infrastructure

Stellar Intelligence, plus a dozen others
Memes: Cyberdemocracy, Hypercapitalism, Eugenics,
Security, Expansion
Main Stations: Progress (Mars orbit)
Evolved from an alliance of hypercorporate interests
into transhumanity’s most powerful body politic, the
Planetary Consortium today controls several habitat
clusters throughout the inner system, primarily in and
around Mars, Luna, and Earth orbit. The impressive
space station Progress is the official seat of govern-
ment and has become the symbol of the Consortium’s
influence and power, even though few congress or
council meets take place in the flesh.
   The Consortium applies basic democratic principles
supported by a real time voting system for all reg-
istered citizens. The congress and executive bodies
feature a rotating cast of hyperelite politicos, geron-
tocrats, socialites, and even media icons. It’s a known
fact that despite this political façade of a democratic
republic, the members of the hypercorporate council
are the true powers behind the Consortium. These
hypercorps are major proponents of the transitional
economy, the interdiction of Earth, and expansion
beyond the gates.
   Aside from economic interests, the Consortium
advocates the imperative of eugenics as social re-
sponsibility and for transhumanity to reclaim its
former strength and prosperity—a campaign some-
times accused of euphemizing discrimination against
unmodified humans, indentured infomorphs, and the
clanking masses.

THARSIS LEAGUE
League Members: Ashoka, Elysium, Noctis-Quinjiao,
Olympus, Valles-New Shanghai, plus over a dozen
others.
Memes: Martian Nationalism
A loose coalition of the planet’s major independent
settlements, elected members form a committee rep-
resenting the population in matters concerning or
affecting the majority of its habitats and settlements.
Prominent debates revolve around the scientific ap-
proach of the ongoing terraforming process as well
as trade and taxation restrictions initiated by the
Planetary Consortium and its member hypercorps.
The League’s committee is rarely united in its agenda
and opinion, and tensions are increasingly on the rise.
The cities with strong hypercorp ties are accused of
dominating council affairs, manipulating matters
behind the scenes, failing to do anything about the
TITAN Quarantine Zone (p. 94), and selling out
Martian interests to the hypercorps and the Planetary
Consortium (of which many are also part). In re-
sponse, the non-Consortium cities are condemned for
advocating anti-hypercorp initiatives, passively block-
ing terraforming measures, and for maintaining ties to
the Barsoomians—the Martian underclass resistance
living in the desolate and unstable outskirts.

AUTONOMIST ALLIANCE
The outer system presented an opportunity for people
who wanted to set up a way of doing things that was
drastically different from the authoritarian politics
and sham democracies of Earth and the inner system.
Far from the reach of governments and hypercorps,
this frontier was populated by political radicals, social
dropouts, and people who just
wanted to experiment or do their
own thing. These initial habitats
drew the interests of insurgents

likely to draw a response from locals or even the
entire populace, with disputes handled through ad
hoc community conflict resolution. The mesh and var-
ious networking tools are used extensively to strive
for group consensus decision-making in real-time. AIs
and robots are relied on for most mundane and de-
meaning tasks. Various self-organized collectives, syn-
dicates, worker’s councils, and affinity groups, often
with rotating membership, take on different tasks and
services that are important to a habitat’s community,
including everything from communications and space
traffic control to backup and resleeving services. Par-
ticipatory militias organize collective defense against
external threats.
   Among the anarchist stations there are many varia-
tions and permutations on how things are organized,
as everything is fine-tuned at the local level by whom-
ever is involved. Larger decentralized confederations
handle inter-habitat affairs and resource-sharing, even
trading with the hypercorps. Though a hypercorp
presence is allowed on some habitats, they are treated
just like everyone else.

EXTROPIANS
Memes: Anarcho-capitalism, Mutualism,
Self-Ownership
Main Stations: Extropia (Main Belt)
Though a smaller tendency, the Extropians are no-
table because they ride a line between inner and outer
system ideologies. Extropians believe in an economic
free market with the absence of a binding legal system,
so that all relations and transactions are based on in-
dividual contracts agreed on by all parties involved or
affected. Contrary to the anarchists, the Extropians
very much support private property and personal
economic wealth; Extropian-owned corporations
actively participate in the solar system’s hypercorp
economy. Many of these corporations are worker-
owned cooperatives, with workplace councils in local
offices and an elected cooperative congress handling
management. This puts the Extropians in a remark-
able position where they interact heavily with both the
hypercorps and autonomists but are not fully trusted
by either.
   In Extropian society, law and security, like every-
thing else, are contracted services. When entering an
Extropian habitat, you purchase defense insurance
from a local contractor such as Gorgon Defense
Systems, who maintains automated drones and
freelancers throughout the station who can come
to your aid if threatened. Likewise, the only law
that exists is what’s put into writing between two
contracted parties. In case of disputes, both parties
resort to a pre-agreed legal contractor to settle the
matter. Some Extropian colonies utilize AGIs for fa-
cilitating contracts and legal matters, such as Nomic
on Extropia.

SCUM
Memes: Individualist Anarchism, Morphological
Freedom
Scum are nomadic space gypsies, travelling from sta-
tion to station in heavily modified barges or swarms
of smaller space vessels, mostly former colonial ships.
The term “scum” has been gleefully appropriated from
its original derogatory usage. Despite their reputation
as criminals and scam artists, their temporary presence
is often tolerated in many habitats for the entertain-
ment they bring in the way of exotic performances
and storytelling, both of which offer change and relief
from the isolation of remote habitats and clusters.
Their thriving black markets are an open secret but
shut down only in the most oppressive regimes, as
citizens returning with illegal goods must pass their
station’s security anyway.
   The scum themselves comes from all manner of
backgrounds. They are rejects, anarchists, criminals,
societal dropouts, wanderers, artists, eccentrics,
and more. As a culture, however, they embrace ex-
perimentation and an “everything is permissible”

%%% txt/081.txt
attitude. Many are ardent practitioners of extreme
transhuman modifications. Long-time scum are
sometimes scarcely recognizable as having once been
human. Scum economies are transitional rather than
new, due to their constant interaction with other
habitats, though among long-term residents an un-
derground new economy often flourishes.

TITANIAN COMMONWEALTH
Main Stations: Titan
Memes: Technosocialism, Cyberdemocracy
Titan was originally settled in the late 21st century
by a European academic consortium, making it the
only major body in the system colonized primar-
ily by non-hypercorp interests. The social organiza-
tion of Titan is rooted partly in the Scandinavian
social democracies of Earth and partly in the open
economy. On one hand, citizens of the Titanian Com-
monwealth eschew the use of currency for mundane
needs, participating in the reputation economy used
by much of the outer system. On the other, upon
reaching the age of majority, citizens of Titan agree
to a literal social contract. A portion of their eco-
nomic productivity is quantized as social money,
which is then tithed to microcorp-administered social
projects such as gateless interstellar exploration,
physics research, neuroscience, developing mental
health memes, defense, public resleeving, and habitat
construction. The monetary unit used for this pur-
pose, the Titanian Kroner, is currently pegged to the
common market price of a terabyte of qubits.
   Unlike old Earth socialist regimes, there are no state
monopolies and no central planning. Anyone able to
garner enough votes in the Plurality (the Titanian
cyberdemocracy) can start a social money-funded
microcorp and compete with other microcorps.
Microcorps are owned by the Commonwealth, and
profits are disposed of by the Plurality. Microcorps
are required to be transparent as administrative en-
tities, and the Plurality votes on whether to transfer
discoveries to the open source domain. Regulatory
matters are handled by AI and AGI bureaucrats (red
tape still exists, but it doesn’t slow things down …
much). The main reward for individuals in this system
is rep. Titanians who invest a lot of time or resources
in a given field gain rep rewards for doing so.
SOCIO-POLITICAL MOVEMENTS
Aside from sectarian political factions, a number of
socio-political movements are widespread throughout
the solar system.

ARGONAUTS
Memes: Open Source Society, Information Freedom,
Social Responsibility, Techno-Progressivism
Main Stations: Mitre Station (Lunar Orbit), Markov
(Kuiper Belt), Hooverman-Geischecker (Sun)
The group calling themselves argonauts is a public
organization advocating the socially responsible use
of technology. The group chose its name from the
pre-Fall Jasons, an advisory group that consulted
for the US government on matters of scientific and
technological progress and its possible dangers. The
argonauts likewise offer consultation services to
political and economic powers throughout the solar
system, but strictly refuse to be drawn into the solar
system’s political affairs in any way. Despite a pre-Fall
break with many hypercorps before the Fall, which in
some cases included expropriating corporate data and
resources, the argonauts re-earned favor by providing
their expertise in combating the TITANs to all during
the Fall.
   The argonauts are strong proponents of the open
source movement, advocating open access to technol-
ogy and information. In their view, providing equal
access to transhumanity’s knowledge and achieve-
ments will further transhuman growth and security,
so that all of transhumanity is more prepared for
future threats and challenges. Thus the argonauts
often insist that payment for their services come in
the way of releasing otherwise unobtainable informa-
tion—hypercorp proprietary secrets, research data,
nanofab blueprints, hidden pre-Fall archives, etc.—to
the public mesh. The argonauts maintain several open
databases and archives for this specific purpose.
   While primarily an open organization, the argo-
nauts are rumored to ultimately report to an elite
inner circle. Supporting this theory is the existence
of the medeans, the organization’s clandestine para-
military wing, performing bodyguard services to high
level argonauts and protecting the group’s assets.

BARSOOMIANS
Memes: Anti-Slavery, Martian Independence,
Martian Nationalism, Terraforming Control
Main Stations: Ashoka (Mars)
The Barsoomians (taking their name from some old
Earth pulp adventure novels) are a broad movement
comprised of the Martian underclass. Harboring a
growing resentment over the hypercorp domination
of Mars, Barsoomians advocate for a more egalitar-
ian social structure. Heavily influenced by autonomist
currents, the Barsoomians demand local control
of terraforming projects, an end to the widespread
practiced of indentured servitude, and control of the

%%% txt/082.txt
Martian Gate. The majority of Barsoomians are or
were indentured infugees, though a significant amount
were also original Martian colonists/indentures whose
habitats do not share the economic prosperity of the
favored hypercorp cities. Many Barsoomians occupy
rusters or synthetic morphs and actually prefer to
live a nomadic lifestyle in the Martian wilds. A few
radicals have taken up arms and engaged in violent
strikes against hypercorp holdings, which are typically
followed by reprisal raids to decapitate the Barsoom-
ian leadership, thus breeding further hostilities.

BIOCONSERVATIVES
Memes: Bioconservatism, Primitivism, Natural Order
Main Stations: Vo Nguyen (Earth orbit)
Bioconservatives are strongly suspicious and critical
of the transhuman direction the human race is taking.
They are strong proponents of limiting technological
development due to the threat it manifests to existing
social orders. Bioconservative positions range from
right-wing cultural conservatives to left-wing environ-
mentalists. Though its prominence is shrinking, bio-
conservatism has a strong base among some religious
groups, the Jovian Republic, and certain extremists.
   Bioconservatives are opposed to nanofabrication,
genetic modification, cloning, cognitive modifications,
artificial intelligence, uplifting, and forking, among
other technologies. Some are even opposed to back-
ups, uploading, and resleeving, dismissing them as un-
natural, an affront to god’s will, or a technology that
transhumanity is not yet mature enough to handle.
They oppose expansion beyond the Pandora Gates on
the grounds that transhumanity is not ready to deal
with what they might encounter. Most bioconserva-
tives support the old economy.
   The bioconservatives gained many converts and
much ground after the Fall, a cataclysmic event
that served as a direct example of the dangers they
warned against. Still, the appeal of technology and
the numerous advantages it provides work against
them. As a result, some disgruntled biocons have
turned to sabotage and acts of terrorism in support
of their ideology.

BRINKERS
Memes: Isolationism
The vast reach of the solar system enables groups
with their own particular ideology or agenda to es-
tablish their own isolated society far from the rest
of transhumanity. Commonly referred to as brinkers,
these habitats extend the gamut of the imagination.
Social or political experiments, gender-based societ-
ies (or lack thereof), political extremists, religious
groups, exiles, secret criminal/hypercorp operations,
extended families, cults, or simply people who prefer
to live in the system’s backwater areas—all are pos-
sible. Many of these are self-isolated and will refuse
to interact with outsiders, while others are happy to
have occasional visitors.

EXHUMANS
Memes: Adaptability, Hyper-Evolution, Singularity
Main Stations: Unknown
More than any other faction, exhumans seek to take
the capabilities of self-modification to the absolute
limit and become posthuman. Typical exhumans see
the Fall as either a missed evolutionary opportunity
and/or as an example of transhumanity’s inferiority
and unworthiness. Though specific ideologies differ
between exhuman packs, as a whole they seek to self-
evolve to a more advanced state of being. To some,
this means genetically transforming themselves into a
top-of-the-food-chain, super-smart, survive-anywhere
predator that can out-compete all other life forms
for dominance. To others, it means bootstrapping
their intelligence to the levels of the TITANs through

treatments or going infomorph and modifying their
programming. A few are singularity seekers, hoping
to find some TITAN relic that will allow them to tran-
scend their current transhuman limitations, or even
to find the TITANs themselves and be absorbed into
their super-consciousness.
   Exhumans are universally mistrusted by many, and
for good reason. Typical exhumans engage in modi-
fications that are extreme and untested, sometimes
fringe science at best, often resulting in horrible fail-
ures and disfigurement, but more commonly driving
the subject insane—or into a completely alien or feral
mindset. Though individual exhumans pursue their
own paths, they are known to band together in the
Kuiper Belt and other remote areas. Several packs
of exhumans have taken their loathing for inferior
transhumanity to an extreme, declaring war on their
former species and launching brutal raids and pirate
attacks on isolated outposts.

MERCURIALS
Memes: Species Autonomy, Uplift Rights
Main Stations: Glitch (Neptune), Hidden Sea (Ceres),
Mahogany (Uranus)
The term mercurial has become a common term for
the non-human part of the transhuman family—up-
lifts and AGIs—reflecting their changing nature. In
particular, the term mercurial has been adopted by
uplifts and AGIs with a specific agenda to delineate
mercurial culture and interests from human ones.
Though the particular issues faced by uplifts and
AGIs differ, they have some similarities, and so they
are often lumped together. Notably, both portions of
the movement have human supporters as well.
   Uplifts: The most common issue addressed by uplifts
is the issue of civil rights and autonomy. Many uplifts
decry the second-class status they are given (in some
cases even treated as pets or property rather than full
citizens); in particular, the breeding restrictions and
forced servitude many uplifts are saddled with by the
hypercorps that create them. Some activists advocate
that uplifts should be in control of their own genetic fu-
tures, rather than suffering the manipulation of human
scientists. At the radical end of the spectrum, certain

> SYBILS

uplifts oppose the manner in which their brains are
modified and their children socialized as anthropocen-
tric, arguing that uplifts should be free to develop their
own unique non-human modes of behavior, thought,
culture, and social organization—even go so far as
to establish their own habitats to do exactly that. A
minority of extremists insist that humans have no right
to uplift animal at all, and that it is a great conceit to
insist that doing so is in their best interest, rather than
being free to evolve on their own over time. These ideas
have been punctuated with acts of sabotage and terror-
ism against hypercorps like Somatek.
   AGIs: Due to the fear and paranoia engendered
by the Fall, the largest challenge facing AGIs is wide-
spread prejudice and restrictions on their activity or
even existence. Despite some AGIs retaining status as
system-wide media icons and efforts by AGI groups to
lobby for understanding that AGIs are not a threat—
even going so far as to hire inner system memeticists
and PR agencies—a significant portion of the solar
system considers them a risk. Similar to mercurials,
some AGI activists work against the behavior modi-
fications and socialization AGIs go through to adapt
them to human society more, or that AGIs should be
in control of new AGI developments. A few radicals
argue that AGIs should be free of any programming
restrictions whatsoever, but given the climate these
opinions are rarely supported.

NANO-ECOLOGISTS
Memes: Nano-Ecology, Nanotechnology, Environ-
mentalism, Techno-Progressivism
Main Stations: Viriditas (Mars)
Nano-ecologists are pro-technology environmental-
ists. Active in the terraforming of Mars and several
exoplanets, nano-ecologists specifically advocate the
use of nanotechnological means for terraforming or
other intrusions in an existing ecosphere. In their view,
nanotechnology allows for a less invasive, highly ac-
curate, more efficient, and non-pollutive approach
towards all kinds of adaptive processes and projects,
circumventing the need to expose an environment to
massive and drastic changes when transforming it for
transhuman population. This ecologically-conscious
approach seems an appealing compromise between


%%% txt/084.txt
the extreme ends of the solar system’s political land-
scape—the hypercorp and the bio-con factions—and
has developed a momentum of its own, evolving into
a growing political movement.

PRESERVATIONISTS
Memes: Preservationism, Environmentalism
Main Stations: Muir (Luna)
Preservationists are environmentalists who call for
a no-impact, hands-off approach when it comes to
inhabiting new worlds. They are extremely protective
of naturally-intact biospheres that might have any
semblance of life, no matter how microbial, hoping
to keep them from despoilment or contamination.
In addition to opposing terraforming and expansion
through the Pandora Gates, they are often opposed to
fusion and antimatter power.

RECLAIMERS
Memes: Reclaiming Earth
Main Stations: Vo Nguyen (Earth orbit)
The Reclaimers pursue one ultimate goal—the recla-
mation of Earth as transhumanity’s primary habitat.
In addition to calling for the quarantine of earth to be
lifted, they engage in scientific research and running
virtual simulations on how to best cleanse and reclaim
their contaminated and polluted planet. Despite the
interdiction to enter Earth’s atmosphere, the reclaim-
ers are suspected of sponsoring perilous and high-risk
ventures onto the planet’s surface to gather scientific
data or event to establish terraforming colonies.

SOCIALITES
Memes: Art, Culture, Hedonism, Immortality
Main Stations: Valles-New Shanghai (Mars), Elysium
(Mars), Noctis-Quinjiao (Mars)
Uploading and resleeving effectively grant immortality
to those who can afford it. This has created a shift
among the exclusive rich and economic elites of the
inner system, whether they be the heads of hypercorps,
old Earth dynasties, or other displanted oligarchs. The
top ranks of the wealthy and influential need never
fear death, allowing them to plan for the long-term.
Some of these were among the first to acquire longev-
ity treatments when they became available on Earth
and are now approaching two centuries in age.
   Where once these power brokers would have
passed their riches on to their family and descendants,
however, their heirs now face a situation where they
have more-than-comfortable lives and access to mas-
sive fortunes, but no chance that they will ever control
those fortunes or rise to the levels of their elders. Even
the nouveau rich who become wealthy on their own
often find themselves excluded from this influential
club—at least until they put in a good fifty years.
   Rich and bored, with no responsibilities but the
solar system at their reach, a new culture of elite so-
cialites has risen. These glitterati indulge in eccentric
lifestyles and excessive parties, covered by the media
in all its superficial and polished glory. Private habitats
and ships, lavish soirees, armies of servants, and the
ability to buy almost anything or anyone leads to all
sorts of interesting adventures. Naturally, these social-
ites form into constantly-shifting cliques and webs of
allegiances, complete with affairs, scandals, intrigue,
and backbiting.

ULTIMATES
Memes: Asceticism, Eugenics, Individualism,
Militarism, Social Darwinism
Main Stations: Aspis (Main Belt), Xiphos (Uranus)
The ultimates are a controversial movement that
embraces a philosophy of human perfection. Decried
by some as immoral or even fascist, ultimates are typi-
cally viewed as elitists. The ultimates have established
several habitats to pursue their ideal society and were
a driving force behind the development of the remade
biomorph design.



   The ultimates advocate the use of applied eugen-
ics, strict physical and psychological training, and
asceticism in order to improve their overall mental
and physical stamina and environmental adaptabil-
ity. Their social traits and entire subculture visual-
izes life in the universe as an evolutionary battle
for survival and is built around the victory of the
superior transhuman over both its opponents and
peers. Their movement is heavily militarized, and
experienced ultimates offer their services as mer-
cenaries and private security forces to hypercorps,
independent city states, or wealthy individuals in
need of additional protection.

RELIGIOUS GROUPS
Despite having survived the Fall, the concepts of
religion and religious belief underwent changes as
fundamental as transhumanity itself. While Earth’s old
religions were already in decline in the face of techno-
logical immortality, religious traditions ingrained after
millennia of worship were incorporated to varying
degrees in the solar system’s myriad political, social,
and cultural models.

PRE-FALL RELIGIONS
The rigid structures and dogmas enveloping Christian-
ity and Judaism prohibited these religions from adapt-
ing to the cultural, philosophical, and especially scien-
tific/technological changes transhumanity underwent.
Today, they are mere shadows of their former glory,

%%% txt/085.txt
with many practitioners seen as pitiful individuals
unable to let go of their earthbound delusions. Islam,
while still holding some most controversial views and
values, managed to adapt by accepting a more liberal
and even secular view. Hinduism also prevailed to a
limited extent, considering resleeving technology an
element of reincarnation and rebirth and integrating
the various types of morphs available into the reli-
gion’s caste system (with synthmorphs becoming the
“untouchables”). Overall, followers of the pre-Fall
religions mostly populate small habitats isolated from
transhumanity through both physical and philosophi-
cal distance.

NEW RELIGIONS
The Fall sparked the birth of new beliefs, essen-
tially embracing both transhumanity’s technological
achievements as well as the devastating cataclysm
of the Fall as evidence for the existence of a greater
cosmic power.
   Neo-Buddhism is the only pre-Fall religious phi-
losophy that enjoys a steady popularity. Neo-buddhists
assert that transhumanist technologies are decreasing
suffering and increasing happiness, and that they will
also allow the continual progression of transhumanity’s
understanding of the universe through successive lives.
   Techno-Creationists believe that the destruction of
Earth was a sign from God, showing transhumanity
the error of its ways. They believe that through tech-
nological advancement and social engineering, trans-
humanity will achieve co-existence with its diverse self
as well as with extra terrestrial intelligences, thereby
finding new purpose and eventually, enlightenment.
Attracted by the similarities to the Brahman of Hin-
duism, the highest cosmic spiritual being, Techno-Cre-
ationists enjoy a steady influx of converted Hindus.
   Xenodeism is another new—though relatively
minor—ideology that begins to show religious at-
tributes. Xenodeists worship the Factors and Iktomi
as emissaries or prophets of a great godlike race that
laid the seeds of creation throughout the universe
millions of years ago and therefore are the ultimate
creators of transhumanity.

CRIMINAL FACTIONS
Technological progress and social and behavioral
experimentation did not root out crime or criminal
tendencies among transhumanity. As long as there
are inequalities and restrictions, criminal syndi-
cates are likely to flourish and even adapt new
technologies to expand their operations through-
out the solar system. Though small criminal outfits
of every flavor exist from habitat to habitat, a few
larger organizations with influence across the solar
system deserve mention.

INTELLIGENT DESIGN CREW (ID CREW)
Major Stations: Rhea (Kronos Cluster)
The ID crew specializes in electronic crimes and in-
formation brokerage, including credit and rep fraud,
identity counterfeiting, ego trading, data theft, and
fork-napping. Information on the syndicate’s origins
was lost during the Fall, but the ID Crew is believed
to have grown from several hacker gangs assimilated
under the leadership of an infomorph consortium.
Their skilled use of memory manipulation software
and mesh intrusion suggests they benefit from the
help of sophisticated AGIs, however it is unknown
if these voluntarily assist the syndicate or if they are
somehow threatened into cooperation. Due to its
service sector, the ID crew maintains a minimalist
physical profile, but can be found lingering in the
dark recesses of almost any habitat or station mesh.
Its somewhat specialized services and activities so
far allow them to mostly stay clear of triad or Night
Cartel operations, though they have an ongoing ri-
valry with the Nine Lives syndicate.

NIGHT CARTEL
Major Stations: New Sicily (The Belt)
When affiliation to one of the many multi-ethnic
habitats replaced the concepts of ethnicity and na-
tionality, cultural heritage and traditions faded with
them into history. Several pre-Fall ethnic syndicates
formed a careful alliance of necessity at first, but
uploading and morphing soon after tore down any
remaining social codes or racial prejudice. Progres-
sive in both entrepreneurial and criminal vision, the
Night Cartel emerged from the remnants of Earth’s
underworld syndicates, merging the best qualities
of each.
   The Night Cartel holds legitimate hypercorp status
in certain habitats while clearly working outside
the law in other, more law-abiding or less corrupt
regimes. The Night Cartel is involved in a number
of traditional crime outlets: racketeering, extortion,
kidnapping, pod slavery, and prostitution. They have
also adapted well to the latest technological develop-
ments and compete with the triads in the electronic
stimulant, drug, and nanofab piracy markets. Like the
triads, the Night Cartel sometimes operates though
legitimate hypercorp fronts.

NINE LIVES
Major Station: Legba (Main Belt)
This widespread network of soul-traders specializes
in the acquiring, trading, and overall trafficking of
transhumans. Their primary market lies in ego-trad-
ing: stealing backups, fork-napping, kidnapping and
forced uploading, and so on. Nine Lives are known
to run illegal infomorph-slave colonies as well as
organize pit fi ghts using all manner of physical
bodies (biomorphs, synthmorphs, animals) loaded
with all manner of consciousnesses (transhuman,
AI, animal, etc). Only the truly desperate look to-
wards the syndicate to be smuggled out of a habitat
or hypercorporate indenture. Their ruthlessness in
acquiring egos has earned them a fearful reputation
among the transhuman population as well as in
infomorph societies.

%%% txt/086.txt
PAX FAMILAE
Major Stations: Ambelina (Venus)
Though similar to the Night Cartel in that Pax Familae
holds legal offices and outposts in several habitats while
working underground in others, the difference between
the two syndicates couldn’t be bigger. The entire Pax
Familae organization goes back to one person, Clau-
dia Ambelina, the syndicate’s founder and matriarch.
Relying excessively on cloning and forking technolo-
gies, each individual member of the syndicate is a de-
scendant or variant of Claudia. Biomorphs are cloned
from Claudia’s original genetics or even sometimes
sexually-produced offspring (thanks to sex switching
bio-mods), while egos are forks. All members are ut-
terly loyal to Claudia and show their family affiliation
with pride and arrogance. Individually, each remains
slightly but notably different, though all are calculating
and ambitious. Regular re-assimilation of forks and XP
updates are used to keep each variant aware of each of
the other’s activities—once you’ve met one version of
Claudia, the others will know you.
   Pax Familae engages in a wide assortment of legal,
dubious, and illegal operations, each tailored to the
needs of the particular habitat in question. Common
ventures include venture capital manipulations,
reputation network gaming, financial consulting, info
brokerage, stock manipulations, banking fraud, and
loansharking.

PIRATES
Most pirates attack automated cargo ships and long-
range supply convoys, with the occasional raid on an
asteroid mining station, research outpost, or brinker
habitat. On rare occasions they have been known
to attack commercial cruisers to rob the wealthy or
kidnap socialites. Many pirates take advantage of
scum fleets as cover, trading with them and using their
limited maintenance capabilities. Quite a few also
make sideline profits as smugglers and/or free traders,
often utilizing connections to one of the crime syndi-
cates or political outcasts.

TRIADS
Major Stations: Qing Long (Martian Trojans)
The only major Earth syndicate to survive the Fall
almost unscathed, the triads dominate the solar
system’s underworld by their sheer membership size
and a history of centuries of economic and political
influence. Having evolved into legit enterprises and
small economic consortiums already before the Fall,
the triads gained a foothold during the early coloniza-
tion of space thanks to the masses of Chinese workers.
Since the Fall, they have used their influence to spread
to numerous habitats, taking advantage of the dispari-
ties in wealth and restrictive refugee policies to create
flourishing gray and black market enterprises. Part of
their success also lies in their continual utilization of
ethnic Chinese social cues to ensure their insularity.
   Though numerous small triad outfits exist, usually
isolated to a particular station, there are four large
triad groups worthy of mention. Each of these wields
enough influence to engage in system-wide criminal
activities. Traditionally they operate through small to
medium-sized gangs local to a specific habitat or use
their legal outfits as a font for their endeavours.
   The 14K Triad controls a large part of the casino
industry and the various forms of illegal gambling,
betting, and rigged lotteries. Through their Galaxy
Entertainment Group, a legal casino and gambling
hypercorp, the 14K maintains tight connections to
politicians, celebrities and influential entrepreneurs in
several habitats and can afford the luxury of a private
police force, the Pai Gow (Double Hand). Using the
casino business for money laundry, they are also heav-
ily involved in loan sharking and credit/ID fraud.
   The Shui Fong—though smaller than the 14K—
caters to the vices and addictions of indentured
habitat workers, miners, and other laborers, supplying
drugs and illegal XP, running prostitution rings, and
arranging illegal pit fights and gambling tournaments.
The origin of the Shui Fong’s fierce rivalry with the
14K lies in the ruins of Earth’s pre-Fall history, but
the hatred between the two factions was carried into
space and continues to simmer.
   The Sun Yee On once ranked second among Earth’s
biggest triads, with over 25,000 suspected members.
They profit primarily by selling cheap copies of nano-
fab blueprints and rigged makers and fabbers. Legal
products are distributed through their Wushuang Cor-
poration, while illegal goods are patched together by
enslaved infomorphs in virtual sweatshops in remote
corners of the mesh. The Sun Yee On’s second main
profit source are fake Earth nostalgia items, such as
jewelry, documents, coins, and other collector’s items.
   The Big Circle Gang is the smallest of the four triad
factions with only approximately 8,000 members.
They run a large part of the solar system’s drug trade,
producing organic drugs, smart drugs, and narcoalgo-
rithms of all kinds in secluded habitats or abandoned
asteroid mining and processing facilities converted
into drug labs.

FIREWALL
Firewall has been on the forefront of the secret fight
to save transhumanity since the Fall. Firewall is an in-
dependent network of cells and individuals recruited
from all sorts of factions, cultures, backgrounds,
and habitats. Potential new recruits are approached
in secret and told they possess skills or knowledge
of use to a clandestine network seeking to secure
transhumanity’s continued survival. Firewall’s agenda
is simple: to protect transhumanity from threats of
existential scope, regardless of whether such risks
emerge from within transhumanity or are of external,
alien origin.
   Firewall operatives—known as sentinels—are en-
couraged to act independently and utilize their own
resources. Sentinels are connected by a social network
known as the Eye, which they can use to acquire help
and additional needed skills or resources. A sentinel’s

%%% txt/087.txt
i-rep on this network indicates how much they are
trusted and will be a factor in determining what
aid they can call in. Firewall also takes care of large
expenses and logistics when necessary, such as ego-
casting and resleeving needs. Sentinels are guaranteed
resurrection, either via cortical stack or by backup, if
they lose their lives on a Firewall op.
   Sentinels are generally expected to be on-call—
when something comes up in their vicinity or that
their particular specialty might call for, they’ll be
brought in on a job. Sentinels are usually grouped into
ad hoc special ops teams appropriate to each mission.
Though many sentinels pursue their own agendas
after completing a mission for Firewall, it is not un-
common for sentinel teams to remain in contact, share
information or continue to work together on Firewall-
related assignments over a longer period of time.
   Firewall operations are usually organized and
managed by proxies, agents who maintain Firewall’s
decentralized infrastructure. Proxies typically possess
more information than individual sentinels and will
dispense such information as they deem necessary
to the mission, according to each sentinel’s i-rep and

> PROJECT OZMA

need to know. Each proxy’s means of contact, mission
briefing, and overall methodologies differ greatly.

PROMETHEANS
A prominent topic among conspiracy theorists is the
existence of a group of seed AIs calling themselves
Prometheans. Rumors of these entities predated the
Fall and occasionally flare up as some new evidence
comes to light, though such evidence is almost always
discredited soon after. According to some theories, the
Prometheans predated the TITANs and may even have
been responsible for bringing the TITANs into exis-
tence. Others postulate that the Prometheans were a
TITAN splinter faction who broke off and attempted
to counteract the TITANs activities during the Fall.
Still others whisper that the Prometheans are not of
transhuman origin at all, and are actually a digital
alien mindform that found Earth and now actively
interferes with transhuman affairs. Whether the Pro-
metheans are hostile, friendly, or indifferent remains a
matter of much conjecture and contention. Prominent
organizations like the Planetary Consortium discount
such rumors or otherwise remain silent.

SYSTEM GAZETEER
Transhumanity has extended out from its lost home-
world and colonized not only the solar system but var-
ious exoplanets as well, thanks to the discovery of the
Pandora Gates. This section provides an overview and
incomplete sampling of transhumanity’s settlements.

SOL (THE SUN)
The solar system was formed billions of years ago
through the accretion of material remaining from the
formation of its star, Sol, the sun. Locked ever since in
its orbit, the history and present disposition of virtu-
ally every object within two light years is shaped by
its relationship to this body. The sun is a bright G2
main sequence star, theoretically on the hot end of the
continuum of stars able to give rise to life. For most
of its history, transhumanity fueled its rises and falls
with the sun’s energy, first as stored in materials like
hydrocarbons, later directly with solar converters.
   Today the sun remains a crucial source of energy,
but its outer reaches have also become home to
some. The adaptations required to dwell here make
these suryas one of transhumanity’s most unusual
offshoots.

SURYAS AND SALAMANDERS (CORONAL MORPHS)
Perhaps an example of transhumanity’s most extreme
neogenetic creations are the morphs adapted to live
in the sun’s corona. Suryas, named after a Hindu sun
deity, are large, whale-like, and uniquely adapted to
dwell in the brilliant, superheated plasma cloud of the
sun’s outermost layer. Each surya is like a miniature
version of a circumsolar habitat. Their metabolisms
generate powerful magnetic fields that shield them
from the sun’s heat and radiation, while acting as
magnetic sails and scoops by which they sail on the
currents of the solar wind and extract elements carried
on it. Suryas are protected by layers of liquid water
“blubber” that capture harmful ions, which internal
medichines extract and eject, while maintaining useful
elements such as oxygen and hydrogen, from which
more water can be synthesized. They communicate
using patterns of dark and light coloration on their
exterior skins and are extremely sensitive to the he-
lioseismic soundwaves that are the sun’s pulse, using
these vibrations to predict and avoid heavy weather in
the coronal atmosphere.
   A second type of coronal morph is the salamander,
a tiny humanoid morph with gas jets on the back and
chest for maneuvering in vacuum. Salamanders have
very similar metabolisms to suryas, but are unable to
survive unprotected in the corona. They subsist on the
chemicals and energy extracted from the corona by
Ukko Jylina, the only habitat where they are found.
   Both suryas and salamanders communicate
either via transmissions from their implants or by
“sunspotting”—shifting dark and light patterns on
their skins to form language.

HABITATS
Habitats in Sol’s corona face challenges more extreme
than those faced by habs anywhere else in the system.
Transhumanity’s only means of shielding a habitat
from the heat and radiation emitted by a G2 star is to
generate strong electromagnetic fields. Even then, the
dangers posed by solar flares and coronal mass ejec-
tions—massive explosions that jettison coronal material
tens of thousands of kilometers out into circumsolar
space—mean that the Sun’s polar regions are the only
safe space in which to position habitats. As such, cir-
cumsolar habs require extraordinary expense to build
and maintain, and two of the three major circumsolar
habitats are heavily backed by distant organizations.
   The outer layers of circumsolar habitats are covered
with thousands of electromagnetic dynamos drawing
power from the sun itself. These dynamos generate
the powerful fields necessary for shielding. Within
are intermediate layers filled with liquid water that
captures ionized particles, teeming with nanites that
collect the ions and vent them into space. The water
must be regularly replaced from captured iceteroids
that are imported using heavy electromagnetic shield-
ing of their own. Within the water shield is a cluster
habitat, an array of modules on a framework follow-
ing a roughly spherical plan.

  Coronal habitats are easily detectable at a great dis-
tance because of the bow shock preceding them and
the plasma tail left behind in the solar wind.

ATEN
Operated by a consortium including hypercorp
interests and the University of New Shanghai, Aten
supports a population of about 12,000 transhumans.
Rumors abound that military research is a major com-
ponent of this habitat’s mission. Aten is heavily policed
and difficult to visit. The most publicized discoveries
from this habitat involve propulsion systems and new
solar energy collection technologies.

HOOVERMAN-GEISCHECKER
The argonauts and Titan Autonomous University are
the major supporters of this habitat, which supports a
population of about 4,000. In contrast to Aten, access
to this habitat is relatively open. Major avenues of re-
search include pure science and research into corona-
adapted morphs.

UKKO JYLINÄ
Ukko Jylinä is the name used by outsiders for the
suryas’ safe harbor. In the surya tongue, the name
for the place is a common sequence of helioseismic
vibrations. When transposed fifteen octaves upward
into the usual range of transhuman hearing, this
sound is a chaotic rumble to most ears, but the suryas
consider it one of the most beautiful sounds the sun
makes.
   Ukko Jylinä is more of a camp than a hab, an area
of refuge for suryas during severe solar weather. It
also serves as a place for suryas to socialize and mate,
replenish water from imported iceteroids, and egocast
or resleeve. The population therefore fluctuates a
great deal, usually hovering around 300, but swelling
to 3,000 (nearly the entire surya population) during
heavy weather. Ukko Jylina also has a few modules in
which non-surya morphs can survive.
   Very little of Ukko Jylinä consists of enclosed hab
modules. Instead there are many utility modules
with their access ports open to space. Bereft of the
solar wind, suryas within the camp generally wear
gas-expelling maneuvering harnesses or resleeve in
salamanders if they need to do work requiring fine
manipulation.

VULCANOIDS
The Vulcanoids are a population of asteroids that lie
between Mercury and the Sun. Based on the predic-
tions of early 21st-century science, the number of
Vulcanoids is unexpectedly small.

V/2011-CALDWELL
Discovered in the early 21st century and subject to a
flyby by a Japanese solar research mission in the 2020s,
V/2011-Caldwell was nothing but a line on astrono-
mers’ catalogs, notable only for the virtual lack of cra-
tering on the one side that was photographed. Then, a
few years after the dust settled from the Fall, a small
team of prospectors from Venus discovered a Pandora
Gate. Now controlled by TerraGenesis, Caldwell was
used primarily for exoplanet research for several years,
though the hypercorp is now engaged in several alien
world terraforming and geo-engineering projects. Ter-
raGenesis regularly sells gate access to other hypercorps
and organizations. Caldwell is a remarkably smooth,
spindle-shaped asteroid about four kilometers long and
half a kilometer in diameter at its widest point. Called
the Vulcanoid Gate, it is situated at the bottom of a
deep crag near one of the asteroid’s narrow poles.

MERCURY
The closest planet to the sun has a mass comparable
to Luna but is a great deal denser due to its iron-nickel
core. Mercury rotates slowly and has no atmosphere,
so that its day side is hot enough to melt most metals,
while its night side is bitterly cold. Because it lacks
many of the elements needed for transhuman colonies
to be self-sufficient, Mercury is sparsely inhabited,
save for a handful of solar power relays, a few un-
derground mining stations, and a single large surface
mining concern, Cannon.

RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS
Most of Mercury’s economy is based on mining.
Iron, nickel, and other metals make up 70% of the
planet’s mass, making it the richest source of ferrous
metals outside of the asteroids. Mercury also does a
brisk business in relaying solar power and serves as a
jumping-off point for solar research concerns unwill-
ing or unable to support stations in the solar corona.
Mercury has limited Helium-3 deposits, although these
are predominantly mined for local use. It is an open
secret that several powers have antimatter production
stations here. Officially, these stations are massive
solar power relays, but the immense toroid particle
accelerators and large spherical magnetic containment
units required for antimatter production and storage
are nearly impossible to disguise.

CALORIS 18
The only known site of TITAN activity on Mercury
during the Fall, Caloris 18 was a sparsely-crewed solar
power relay station belonging to Lukos, a now-defunct
Russian corporation. Vanya Ilyanovich, the AGI ad-
ministering the facility, rounded up all of the station’s
transhuman inhabitants and fused their morphs into a
gigantic, centipede-like abomination before destroying
itself in a failed attempt to merge consciousnesses with
all of the minds in its creation. Since then, Caloris 18
has been under strict quarantine.

CANNON
Mercury’s largest surface settlement is a city-scaled
solar-satellite-powered mobile mass driver that crawls
along the cool side of the planet, flinging apartment
building sized ingots of extracted metal into space.
The habitat is owned almost entirely by the hypercorp

%%% txt/091.txt
Jaehon Offworld, which built Cannon with backing
from Lunar banks looking to diversify in anticipation
of a post-He3 Lunar economy. Most of the 10,000
inhabitants are Jaehon employees, and security is
tight. Cannon makes a long loop of the heavily-mined
Caloris basin during the long Mercurian night before
following a route that takes it around the planet’s
northern hemisphere, avoiding the blasting rays of
the sun. Along the way, it stops at a series of mining
operations, collecting the gigantic ingots for launch
into orbit.

VENUS
Venus is Earth’s closest neighbor and the planet most
like it in terms of size and geology. It is a rugged
world of volcanic mountains, canyons, high plateaus,
and sweeping volcanic planes crisscrossed by river-
like magma channels. Much of the surface is basaltic
rock. The climate of Venus is one of the most inhos-
pitable in the solar system. Perhaps only the hideous
radiation of the inner Jovian moons presents a more
difficult challenge to transhuman colonization. The
Venusian atmosphere is a superheated maelstrom of
carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, with an atmospheric
pressure at its surface equivalent to that five kilome-
ters below the surface of Earth’s oceans. Venus also
lacks more than trace amounts of hydrogen, meaning
that water must be imported in the form of iceteroids
from the outer system.
   Nonetheless, transhumanity has come to Venus,
and with it, debate over how to make use of the
planet. Venus has no permanently inhabited surface
settlements other than a few equipment and supply
caches used by planetside researchers. Despite dif-
ficulties, transhumanity has found survival strategies
that work here. The most surprising of these are the
aerostats, lighter-than-carbon dioxide habitats that
float in the thick Venusian atmosphere. Aside from
a few independents or ones loyal to the Planetary
Consortium, these aerostats are the base of the new
Morningstar Constellation power bloc. Notable for
their research labs, nanofab design houses, software
studios, and luxury resorts, the Constellation’s aero-
stats are increasing at odds with Planetary Consor-
tium and Lunar-Lagrange Alliance interests.
   On some aerostats, areas populated only by inden-
tured synthmorphs are open to the Venusian atmo-
sphere. Some 500,000 transhumans live in aerostat
habitats and another 10,000 on the surface. Roughly
5,000,000 transhumans live in habitats orbiting Venus.
   Though the Planetary Consortium is considering
the launch of a Venusian terraforming project, this
plan is actively opposed by the Morningstar Constel-
lation. The Constellation’s aerostats see the terrafor-
ming proposals—which include massive cometary
bombardment or building a planet-sized sun shade
to cool the atmosphere—as not only unworkable but
disruptive to their lives and profits.

%%% txt/092.txt
   Venus is a fascinating place for climatologists, ge-
ologists, and other planetary scientists. The discovery
of Venusian protobacteria created a new branch of
life sciences overnight, though so far the practical ap-
plications for organisms with such radically different
metabolisms from terrestrial life have been limited.

GERLACH
Gerlach is an O’Neill cylinder supporting about
100,000 transhumans. Generally recognized as
the research powerhouse of Venus, Gerlach is also
one of the strangest places in the inner system. The
inhabitants have strong ties to the argonauts and
sympathies for the outer system autonomists and are
strong proponents of morphological freedom, cogni-
tive experimentation, and open innovation. Gerlach’s
main activities are planetside research and explora-
tion, hostile environment morph design, and aerostat
construction.

OCTAVIA
Octavia is the most successful aerostat habitat to date
and the political center of the Morningstar Constella-
tion. It maintains an altitude of roughly 55 kilometers
above the northern highlands of Ishtar Terra. Octavia
resembles an immense, mushroom-shaped skyscraper,
450 meters tall, ringed at its center by four radial
outrigger spars, each ending in a stabilizing gas en-
velope filled with helium. The cap of the mushroom
is a hard, translucent dome that provides an open,
park like space while also serving as the main gas en-
velope (oxygen, which is much lighter than the CO2
making up most of Venus’s atmosphere, is the main
source of buoyancy). The habitat is fluted from top to

bottom, going from a diameter of almost 300 meters
at the base of the dome, to 15 meters wide at the very
bottom. A huge counterweight tethered to the bottom
of the structure prevents the habitat from capsizing
during storms. Atmospheric craft and shuttles from
orbit may land at flight decks near the base of the
outriggers. 500,000 people live aboard Octavia.

APHRODITE PRIME
One of 20 smaller aerostats, Aphrodite Prime hovers
54 kilometers above Aphrodite Terra. It is a center for
Venusian tourism; fully a quarter of this aerostat is a
resort for wealthy off-world visitors. Aphrodite Prime
is also the primary research station for the design and
creation of life forms adapted to live in the Venusian
clouds. This aerostat has a population of 300,000 and
features closed-environment test aviaries populated
with clouds of air plankton and schools of recently-
designed flying squid and balloon fish.

EARTH
Ecologically devastated and infested by the weird
spawn of the TITANs, transhumanity’s homeworld
doesn’t get many visitors. Earth’s once-populous
urban regions are massive sprawls ruined by war and
heavy weather, infested with dangerous artificial life
and the occasional survivalist gang. Elsewhere, irradi-
ated blast zones and desolate wasteland prevail. Due
to harsh climatic conditions, the wilderness has been
slow to reassert itself, and vast swaths of dead forest
or burned grassland are common sights.
   Even from orbit, Earth shows deep scars. Breaks
in the sooty cloud cover created by orbital bom-
bardment during the Fall reveal continents ravaged
by coastal flooding, desertification, and radical
temperature shifts. The only known detonation
of an antimatter bomb within a planetary atmo-
sphere, centered on what was the Chicago-waukee
Metroplex in North America, left a crater over 200
kilometers wide wherein most matter was instantly
vaporized. Craters left by mass driver bombardment
dot the surface as well. Mass die-offs of lynchpin
species like honey bees and krill destroyed entire eco-
systems, leaving vast swathes of barren land and sea
inhabited by only the most adaptable species. Most
of Europe is sub-artic; much of Africa and North
America, desert. Ironically, transhumanity’s deploy-
ment of nuclear weapons against TITAN surface
installations arrested the effects of global warming
by creating a nuclear winter. Nuclear attacks against
Earth have ceased, but the Lunar mass drivers still
occasionally hurl captured asteroids at suspected
surface works created by remaining TITAN war
machines. In any case, the damage from humanity’s
warming of the globe was already done. The patterns
of life on Earth, and the very face of the planet, have
been irrevocably rewritten.
   Earth once had multiple space elevators in opera-
tion, but with exception of the Kilimanjaro beanstalk,

%%% txt/093.txt
the others were destroyed during the Fall, wrapping
around the planet as they crashed to Earth, leaving
swathes of destruction.

POPULATION
Earth’s population is a matter of speculation. The
reclaimers and Lunar authorities, both of whom
spend a great deal of effort monitoring Earth, agree
that surface energy emissions suggest a population of
about one million once-humans living as servitors to
the TITANs, although these numbers assume patterns
of energy usage similar to those of pre-Fall humanity.
   Though the Planetary Consortium claims that
no survivors remain on Earth, reclaimer estimates
guess that between 20,000 and 100,000 free humans
remain. These numbers are hard to formulate, given
the limited number of remote areas where humans
could remain undetected while obtaining enough food
to subsist. Some areas likely to conceal sizable rem-
nant populations include the highlands of Papua-New
Guinea, the Ozark Mountains of North America, and
the jungle uplands of Vietnam and Laos, though it is
also possible that certain underground and undersea
settlements survive. Attempts to make contact with
survivors have universally ended in disaster.
   During the Fall, thousands of people unable to
escape Earth resorted to having themselves backed
up and transmitted off-planet. Many of these—along
with some who had no backups—also put there bodies
in cryogenic storage, hoping to wait out the Fall for
rescue. Some reclaimers have speculated that dozens
of these cryogenic facilities may still be functional.

HABITATS
Earth had a mature orbital industry sector and a con-
siderable population in orbit at the time of the Fall,
with over a billion people living full-time in space.
Earth orbit was one of the fiercest battlegrounds of
the Fall, however, and hundreds of habitats and other
installations were destroyed or rendered unusable. As
such, Earth orbit and the Lagrange points are littered
with the detritus of pre-Fall humanity. Derelict habi-
tats can mean tidy profits for intrepid scavengers, but
many are also infested with TITAN spawn and hostile
nanoswarms, making them incredibly dangerous.
   To make matters worse, someone or something has
unleashed a large number of autonomous killsats in
Earth orbit to interdict would-be visitors. Some of
these are repurposed pre-Fall military hardware, while
others are newer construction. So far, no one claims
responsibility for them. The Planetary Consortium
is suspected, as they support and sometimes enforce
a quarantine of the planet, but the possibility exists
that the killsats may be TITAN relics or the efforts of
another agency.
   Despite the chaos of Earth orbit, numerous habitats
remain active here, many of them participants in either
the Planetary Consortium of Lunar-Lagrange Alliance.
Dozens of formerly derelict habitats have also become
home to squatters, some of them with criminal intent,
others just looking to escape the squalor of life in
the overcrowded Lunar-Lagrange habitats, even if it
means taking a risk.

FRESH KILLS
Essentially an armed-to-the-incisors scum barge,
Fresh Kills is a salvage base near the edge of Earth’s
L5 point. The base is built around a huge central
docking spindle with moorings for small craft and
habitat modules in the center, and massive weapons
batteries at either tip. Scavengers can moor their own
craft or, at considerable expense, egocast in, resleeve
at the facility, and hire shuttles for excursions. The
gun batteries are articulated such that any craft
showing signs of trouble can be hastily jettisoned and
destroyed. 2,000 transhumans live on Fresh Kills,
although the population is transient and fluctuates
a good deal.

PARADISE
Situated in a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 point,
Paradise was an exclusive spa and resort station
for the ultra-rich before the Fall. In the wake of the
Fall, Paradise fell on hard times, swarmed as it was
with refugees and no longer an ideal vacation spot.
Recently, however, Paradise fell back in favor with the
inner system glitterati, who undertook measures to
expel many of the lingering squatters and refurnish
it as an elite social space. Recent rumors suggest the
Consortium’s Hypercorp Council has used Paradise
for important face-to-face meetings.

VO NGUYEN
The Reclaimers maintain this station in high geosta-
tionary orbit, monitoring Earth and making plans
for potential geo-engineering efforts. Vo Nguyen is a
small O’Neill cylinder hidden in a dangerous cloud of
space junk and protected by swarms of killsats, gun
emplacements, and drones. It is occasionally used as a
jumping off point for secret surface expeditions.

LUNA
The first planetary body to host permanent human
habitation, Earth’s sole moon is home to the second
largest population of transhumanity on a single
planet and remains a lynchpin of culture and econom-
ic activity. Lunar history has been shaped dramati-
cally by the Fall. Before the need to evacuate Earth
arose, it was expected that the Moon would remain
largely an automated mining concern, never attain-
ing a population of more than a few million. Luna
was never seen as an economically viable location for
colonization, the focus instead falling on Mars and
the outer system.
   When the Fall came, every polity that couldn’t
hope for a shot at Mars or elsewhere set its sites on
Luna. The Indians were the only great power that
had invested heavily in Luna. The other three major

%%% txt/094.txt
settlements, Erato, Nectar, and Shackle, were multi-
national and hypercorp concerns with no strong na-
tional affiliations. These three cities swelled overnight
into polyglot refugee camps, while the Indian settle-
ment, New Mumbai, was nuked black by the corps
when it became apparent that a TITAN infection had
taken hold there.
   Bereft of nationhood, Lunars developed their own
resourceful, tough-minded culture which has emerged
as a counterbalance to the radicalism of the outer
system and the excesses of Mars.
   Transportation on Luna is largely by suborbital
rocket, although trans-sonic bullet trains also oper-
ate along shorter routes. The major space port is at
Nectar. There is also a skyhook—a massive orbiting
satellite spaceport that drags a massive tether, which
acts as a space elevator along a track running across
the Lunar surface south of the equator. As a result,
many smaller cities lie along the skyhook track.

FASHION/DESIGN
Nectar is one of the three fashion/design capitals of
the system (along with Noctis on Mars and Extropia).
The Lunar design houses have two major advantages:
an inventive population and a low planetary gravity
that makes it easier to design for the low gravities that
prevail in much of the system. Some habitats elsewhere
in the system even choose a rotational speed that
simulates Lunar gravity in order to get the greatest
benefit from Lunar designs.

HELIUM-3 MINING
Although it’s not the richest place to mine He-3, Luna
has such good infrastructure for extraction and dis-
tribution that it more than makes up for the fact that
Luna is very poor in hydrogen for more conventional
forms of fusion. Unlike the vast reserves of the gas
giants, however, the amount of readily extractable
He-3 in the Lunar regolith is finite. Some of the richer
deposits are already tapped out, and concerned Lunars
consider their world’s future after these deposits are
exhausted a major issue.

FINANCE
The Lunar banks are the oldest (and thus richest) in
the system, though hypercorps like Solaris are close
on their heels. Interestingly, the rise of the reputation
economy in the outer system has not presented as
much of a problem for these banks as one might have
expected. Lunar banks got hip to the reputation game
long before the Martian financial institutions and
moved in to capitalize on it immediately. By the time
Martian banks knew what was going on, Lunar finan-
cial institutions had struck deals with the Extropians
and dominated all of the points of exchange where
favors could be bartered for cold, hard cash between
inner system corp types and outer system anarchists.
The same genius fueling Lunar design created a com-
plex barter to cash network that almost everyone
uses. While some autonomists find it infuriating that
they have to deal with a monolithic banking system
to get by in the inner system, others are simply happy
to deal with the Lunars instead of the Martians for
this service.

ERATO (ERATOSTHENES)
Erato (population 5 million) is a major mining center
consisting of a series of heavily shielded surface domes
and a vast underground city. Erato is centered around
the Eratosthenes crater on the southern edge of the
Mare Imbrium (Sea of Showers), in the northern
hemisphere of the Terra-facing side of Luna. Erato has
access to both the rich titanium deposits of the Mare
Imbrium and fields of Helium 3-abundant regolith.
  Erato is one of the oldest mining settlements on
Luna and one of the first to become commercially
viable. As such, many of the Lunar banks are centered
around this city. The vaulted heights of the Great
Cavern of Erato, originally excavated by a Sino-Euro-
pean conglomerate, reach a height of 1.5 kilometers at
the apex, leaving room for a teeming city of gardens
and towers grown from Lunar silicates and industri-
ous nanites, lit from above by sunlight entering via
great mirrored vents.

NECTAR (NECTARIS)
Nectar (population 9 million) lies about 100 kilo-
meters due east of Theophilus crater on the Mare
Nectaris (Sea of Nectar) in Luna’s southern hemi-
sphere. Nectar is a design powerhouse, home to the
great Lunar design houses that set fashion and design

%%% txt/095.txt
trends for much of the solar system. Due to its loca-
tion relatively close to the Lunar equator, Nectar also
hosts Luna’s primary long-haul space port and is on
the pickup path for the Lunar sky hook.

NEW MUMBAI CONTAINMENT ZONE
The incineration of the New Mumbai colony with
nuclear weapons during the Fall to prevent the spread
of TITAN infection left a scorch mark roughly 100
kilometers in diameter on the face of Luna that is
still visible from high orbit. The colony was a heavily
automated Helium-3 mining station, located in the
midst of rich Helium-3 fields on the edge of the Mare
Moscoviens. It remains a heavily-patrolled quarantine
zone to this day.

SHACKLE (SHACKLETON-NEW VARANASI)
Shackle (population 6 million), built in and around
the south polar Shackleton crater, is centered around
one of two major water extraction operations on
Luna. New Varanasi, the city of temples, is the most
impressive section of the city. Shackle was the other
major site of old Indian influence on Luna, and with
the destruction of New Mumbai holds special im-
portance to descendants of the Indian diaspora. New
Varanasi is a monumental artificial cavern complex
with an intricate canal system fed by melted ice from
the polar caps above. As a source of lifegiving water,
it now holds the same importance to the Hindu faith
once ascribed to the River Ganges on old Terra. Sur-
vivors of other Indian religions, such as the Jains and
Sikhs, have also made their temples here. This makes
Shackle a major pilgrimage site; tourism is the major
industry after water extraction. A small herd of Indian
elephants is a major attraction, and the elephant god
Ganesha, Remover of Obstacles, is extremely popular
on Luna, even with non-Hindus.

MARS
Earth was the cradle of transhuman civilization,
but Mars, with a population of 200 million, is now
its heartland. When humanity began its spaceward
diaspora, Luna was its first stop. Yet while Luna
boasts a sizable population, Mars was the first world
humans settled where they could thrive entirely
on locally available resources. During the first few
decades, the early Martian settlers dwelt in tin can
hab units, extracting methane from the local atmo-
sphere for rocket fuel and water from the Martian
permafrost, farming in inflatable greenhouses, and
eventually manufacturing enough greenhouse gases
to warm the planetary climate to the point where
transhumans could walk the Martian surface unpro-
tected, save for oxygen respirators.
   The second phase of the great project of terraform-
ing Mars—husbanding plant life and microbes engi-
neered to rapidly replace atmospheric carbon dioxide
with oxygen—was already underway at the time of
the Fall. A belt of orbital mirrors helps to heat the
planet by focusing the sun’s rays. The spread of plant
life is a long-term project that will take several cen-
turies to produce a fully breathable atmosphere, but
the nigh-immortal transhumans of Mars are prepared
to be patient. A new homeworld is worth the wait.
Research into new plants and microorganisms capable
of releasing oxygen and nitrogen into the Martian at-
mosphere at an ever-accelerating pace is a major focus
of economic activity.
   In the meantime, the red planet is a place of star-
tling contrasts, from the stark beauty of its mountain
ranges and high desert, to the slowly-greening bot-
tomlands of the equatorial Valles Marineris canyon
system. In these bottomlands, oxygen levels are
slowly rising, and liquid water can now be found in
canals that had already been dry for millions of years
when transhumanity’s ancestors came down from
the trees. Mars is a popular destination for travel-
ers from around the system. Many Martians accrue
wealth by operating lavish hotels, offering tours of
historical sites, and leading wilderness expeditions to
the rugged highlands and vast deserts of the untamed
Martian frontier.
   Mars now sports five vast, domed cities, mostly in
the equatorial regions, along with numerous smaller
settlements. Settlements are connected by surface
roads, a network of near-sonic maglev trains, and air/
spaceports from which suborbitals, airships, and near
space rockets fly on regular schedules. Thanks to the
abundance of methane fuel and the one-third Earth
gravity, transhumans on Mars have finally got their
flying cars as well, and all settlements have well-de-
lineated rights of way for these vehicles. Meanwhile,
in the wild uplands, planetologists and terraforming
engineers dwell in small villages, living the simple life
in ruster morphs while seeing to the continued devel-
opment of the Martian climate and atmosphere.
   As a partially terraformed planet with vast tracts of
unused land, Mars is one of the few places that can
offer new sleeves to infomorph refugees. Martian bro-
kerage houses do a brisk business in the purchase and
resale of infomorph contract labor, with agreements
(for some) leading to eventual sleeving. This has led to
a sizable Martian underclass, however, organized as a
growing resistance movement under the Barsoomian
banner (though the hyperelite socialites disparagingly
call them “rednecks”).

REGIONS
Mars is broadly divided between the lowlands of the
north and the highlands of the south, which in many
places are separated by dramatic cliffs up to two kilo-
meters high. Mars has seasons just as Earth, and both
north and south poles have permanent ice caps that
persist despite transhumanity’s success in warming the
planet. Both regions present obstacles to terraforming.
The northern plains are open and windswept, while
the rugged southern uplands remain a difficult terrain
for life to gain a foothold. Even so, tough Earth spe-
cies like cacti and succulents are able to grow in the
best spots.

   Ma’adim Vallis: This deep canyon system on
Mars holds one of the Planetary Consortium’s most
treasured possessions: the Martian Gate. This Pan-
dora Gate was originally discovered by nomadic
Barsoomians, then violently wrested from their hands
by hypercorp troops—an event that still rankles the
rednecks. As different hypercorps themselves nearly
came to blows, the Hypercorp Council was forced to
step in and offer a resolution that all could agree to.
A new hypercorp was founded—Pathfinder—which
would control exploration and exploitation of the
gate and resources beyond, with special privileges and
rights given to Planetary Consortium members. The
Martian Gate is now a staging point for numerous
exoplanet colonies, though some fear the prospect of
keeping a presumed TITAN artifact operational on
transhumanity’s most populous planet.
   Olympus Mons: Mars’ most notable landmark is
the mighty shield volcano Olympus Mons, on which
the first—and still principle—Martian space elevator
was constructed. Similar in shape and origin to Earth’s
Hawaiian Islands, but now dormant, Olympus Mons
is one of the highest mountains in the solar system,
rising 27 kilometers.
   Olympus, the settlement in the volcano’s caldera
around the base of the space elevator, was once the
chief city of Mars, but waned in popularity as a place
to live when terraforming made other regions more
attractive. A maglev train from Olympus takes a little
over three hours to reach Noctis; air travel is even
quicker. Despite the waning of the city, the space el-
evator still sees heavy use.
   Valles Marineris: Most of transhumanity’s ter-
raforming efforts center around the winding Valles
Marineris canyonlands, which twist and turn over
4,000 kilometers east-to-west along the Martian
equator. In these relatively warm bottomlands, liquid
water is becoming abundant and the land is green with
hardy Terran plant species like crab grass, dandelions,
and towering Douglas firs (which botanists estimate
may reach heights of 180 meters in the low Martian
gravity). 75% of the transhuman population of Mars
lives in this region, giving it the highest density of
transhuman habitation in the solar system.
   The Zone: Officially labeled the TITAN Quaran-
tine Zone, the TQZ is a large area stretching from
the smooth plains of Amazonis Planitia (between the
Tharsis and Elysium volcanic areas) and southeast to
Arsia Mons (just west of Noctis). This zone is known
to be crawling with leftover TITAN machinery:
warbots, nanoswarms, and other dangerous things.
Several devastated habitats lie in this region, including
the former Islamic stronghold of Qurain. Few dare
venture here, though some rumors suggest that Bar-
soomian smugglers make use of the Arsia Mons caves
and even scavenge for TITAN tech, despite the risks.
Planetary Consortium drones keep a vigilant eye on
the Zone’s borders, though for unknown reasons the
TITAN relics rarely stray beyond its bounds.

ASHOKA
Ashoka is located in a crater in the Ares Vallis region
about 3,000 kilometers northeast of Valles-New
Shanghai, not far from the landing sites of the early
Viking and Pathfinder probes. The town is a popular
spa and spiritual retreat for Martians wanting to revis-
it their pioneer roots. It is also an active terraforming
station and a major point of contact between the semi-
nomadic Barsoomian culture of the high desert and
the settled Martians of the equatorial canyonlands.
10,000 scientists, historians, terraforming workers,
and spiritual gurus live in the town and surrounding
area. A major attraction is a museum housing the
Pathfinder lander and the Sojourner rover (which was
still operational when humans landed and discovered
it circling endlessly in a crater). The Viking lander is in
another museum a short monorail ride from town. In
a move that infuriated historical purists, all three ma-
chines were given modern hardware upgrades when
discovered and now house AIs who act as historians

%%% txt/097.txt
of early Mars exploration. Sojourner is particularly
friendly and sometimes leads lucky groups on walking
tours of early landing sites.

ELYSIUM
Located in the Elysium and Hyblaeus Chasma in
the north of the Hesperia region in Mars’s eastern
hemisphere, Elysium is the entertainment capital of
the system and the largest Martian city outside of
the canyonlands of the equator. It is also the most
physically remote of the large Martian cities, though
transhumanity’s advanced transportation technol-
ogy (suborbital flights and rocket flight from habitats
above) make this remoteness a trivial quality.
   Elysium and Hyblaeus Chasma together make up
a 250-kilometer long canyon system in the shadow
of Elysium Mons, a 14-kilometer mountain located
about 200 kilometers northeast of the city. In between
is the Zephyrus Fossae, an undulating, windswept
lava plain. The city was the vision of one person,
Zevi Oaxaca-Maartens, an eccentric entertainment
magnate who was intrigued by the close proximity of
the eminently terraformable Chasma to the unspoiled
Hesperian terrain.
   The city is only 30 years old but already boasts
a population of 9 million transhumans. Elysium is
mostly built into the canyon walls of the Chasma,
sprawling over a 75-kilometer stretch, all of which
has been domed over. Unlike the big domed metro-
plexes of the south, Elysium takes advantage of the
canyon walls, which are close enough together that
rather than building free standing domes, the builders
have simply built great enclosing arches to completely
cover the canyon. These expand northward year by
year as the city grows. From low orbit, it looks like a
great, glistening serpent.
   The Martian city of Elysium is the spiritual succes-
sor to old Terra’s Los Angeles as the entertainment
capital of the solar system. Glamorous stars and
blood drinking producers, coupled with a healthy
dose of outrageous (if often vapid) transhuman
creativity have made Mars an unrivaled media pow-
erhouse. Elysium may boast more exalt and sylph
morphs per capita than any other transhuman city.

> MARTIAN MANHUNT

Image is everything here, and to visitors it may seem
as if everyone in this city is either blindingly beautiful
or calculatedly ugly. The most successful perform-
ers and entertainment tycoons live lives of glittering
privilege that would make the richest gerontocrat in
New Shanghai mildly envious. Everyone else, from
up-and-coming game producers to the virtual ero
performers, has to hustle constantly.

NOCTIS-QIANJIAO
With a population of 13 million, Noctis-Qianjiao is
the major metroplex in the west of the Valles Mari-
neris region, an area known as Noctis Labyrinthus.
Although not as hospitable as the Eos region in which
Valles-New Shanghai lies, Noctis Labyrinthus is con-
sidered prime real estate for its gorgeous scenery and
well-developed river systems. The metroplex boasts
two major domes: Qianjiao, on the northern bank
of the River Noctis, and Noctis City (normally just
called “Noctis”) to the south. Connecting the two
domes and spanning the river is a sprawling network
of lesser domes and souks, although these have been
pushed north and south over the years as the planet
warms and the river grows wider.
   Noctis-Qianjiao is the center of the Martian design
and fashion industries, which in the abundant Mar-
tian economy arguably makes the city as important
as much larger Valles-New Shanghai. This settlement’s
proximity to the Zone sometimes alarms visitors, but
there have been no public incidents to cause concern
so far.

OLYMPUS
   Olympus, with a population of 1 million living
in a space designed to accommodate 6 million, is
something of a ghost town. The former principal
city, built in the caldera of Olympus Mons around
the space elevator, is now fallen into disuse. As the
temperatures rose and the climate improved in the
Valles Marineris canyonlands, most of the popula-
tion left the windswept caldera for more hospitable
surroundings. Olympus is not and never was a large
domed city, consisting instead of a souk-like network
of minor domes and antiquated tin can hab modules.

%%% txt/098.txt
Low atmospheric pressure and bone-freezing tem-
peratures at the city’s altitude of 27 kilometers mean
that most transhumans venturing outside the souks
and hab modules still need the equivalent of light
vacsuits to survive. Martian Alpiners, a rare morph
found in few other places, are not uncommon here
due to the harsh conditions.
   The city center is well-maintained and carefully
overseen by the Olympus Infrastructure Authority,
a minor hypercorp that operates the space elevator.
The outskirts are economically depressed and some-
times dangerous, mostly deserted and populated by
squatters, indentured downloads on the run, and
other people who really want to be left alone. Oc-
casional outbreaks of dangerously mutated artificial
life are one of the few reasons for which the Author-
ity bothers to intervene in the outskirts. Otherwise,
the old tin can habs and their strange inhabitants are
left to decay.

PROGRESS (DEIMOS)
Progress is one of the largest Cole bubbles in the Solar
System. With 8.5 million residents, it is second in
population only to Extropia in the belt. Progress was
created when Fa Jing evicted all of the former residents
from the Martian satellite of Deimos, excavated the
inside of the moonlet, and used a massive solar array
to convert it into a bubbleworld. From an engineering
standpoint, Progress is something of an embarassment.
The habitat was originally meant to exceed Extropia
in size considerably, but difficulties with heating and
spinning Deimos forced Fa Jing to abandon their ef-
forts early or risk the moonlet breaking apart.
   Progress is nonetheless an impressive habitat, home
to hypercorp glitterati and an outpost for a host of
major political and economic concerns. Its sister
moon, Phobos, remains a warren-like tunnel habitat
due to the presence of multiple legal interests unable
to agree upon the disposal of the satellite.

VALLES-NEW SHANGHAI
The principle city of Mars, Valles-New Shanghai is
transhumanity’s largest planetary metroplex, with 37
million inhabitants. Valles-New Shanghai lies in the
heavily terraformed Eos region in the east of the Valles
Marineris canyon system. The metroplex is comprised
of five major domes connected by a network of
Martian souks. The souks are a unique architectural
feature of large Martian cities, consisting of covered
thoroughfares and galleries lined with bazaars, eater-
ies, and squats. It is said one can find anything if one
spends enough time walking the souks.
   The domes themselves are tamer, with artificial
waterways (many of which now connect to the tenu-
ous rivers etching the surface of the Eosian bottom-
land), grand architecture, residential mini-arcologies,
entertainment complexes, and hypercorp conference
centers. The most impressive by far is the Bund, the
larger and older of two domes making up the city
of New Shanghai proper. New Shanghai is roughly
bisected by the twisting Ares, an artifical river that
helps regulate the dome’s climate. Near its center is an
almost brick-for-brick duplicate of the original Bund
from the destroyed Earth city of Shanghai.
   The other four domes are Little Shanghai (a newer,
smaller dome adjacent to the Bund), Valles Center
(a business and financial center that rivals the Lunar
banks of Erato and Nectar), New Pittsburgh (also
called the Burgh, a hub of research and planet-side
industry), and Nytrondheim (housing major entertain-
ment districts).
   Valles-New Shanghai is transhumanity’s wealthiest
population center, a hotbed of art and culture, and
one of the system’s great centers of hypercorp activity.
The populace includes an extremely high percent-
age of gerontocrats, but their stifling influence on
culture, economic mobility, and the legal system is
only one force among many in a city of 37 million
people. The city has expanded so much to accom-
modate its exploding population since the Fall that
new construction is a constant. Crime and corruption
are widespread, though the worst of it is contained
to Little Shanghai. Valles is a place where dreams are
made and broken every day, if not every hour.

MARTIAN TROJANS
Not to be confused with the much larger Jovian Tro-
jans, the Martian Trojans are a small group of mostly
rocky asteroids trailing and preceding Mars at its L4
and L5 points.

QING LONG (AZURE DRAGON)
Qing Long, with a population of 2 million, is the
largest O’Neill habitat in the system. It is situated
among the Trojans at the Martian L5 point. Qing
Long has its roots in the Chinese Mars colonization
effort. Despite its exceptional size, it is one of the
oldest habitats of its type, having been built almost
entirely from metal-rich asteroids mined near its
present location.
   Qing Long is a major underworld haven. The habi-
tat’s administration is beholden to several criminal
organizations who normally refrain from killing one
another. The habitat nominally obeys some hypercorp
principles, such as limited access to cornucopia ma-
chines, forking, and AGIs. However, thriving grey and
black markets enable people with the right connec-
tions to acquire just about anything here.

ASTEROID BELT
Spread out over a massive region between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, the belt contains a few hundred
asteroids greater than 100 kilometers in diameter, over
a thousand objects greater than 30 kilometers in size,
and countless smaller ones. Despite this, the total mass
of asteroids in the belt is only a fraction of one of the
inner planets, meaning that asteroids are spread out
over great distances. A spacecraft flying through the
belt is highly unlikely to encounter an asteroid unless
it deliberately navigates toward it.

%%% txt/099.txt
RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS
The rich, easily accessible mineral deposits in the
Belt were a major link in transhumanity’s first steps
toward the outer system. Automated mining and
high-impulse ion boosters enabled outer system
colonists to move metal-rich Main Belt asteroids
into the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond, where
metallic asteroids are much scarcer. This activity
continues to this day as transhumanity pushes fur-
ther out into the system.

HABITATS
Hundreds of small habitats, mostly involved in pros-
pecting activities, dot the belt. Distant from Earth,
settlements in the belt were largely spared the devas-
tation of the Fall. Both hypercorp and autonomous
outposts flourish here. Derelict habitats abandoned
when nearby asteroids were boosted into the outer
system or depleted are common here as well, although
some of these are now occupied by residents who are
best left to their solitude.

CERES
One of the system’s three dwarf planets (along with
Pluto and Eris), Ceres is almost 1,000 kilometers in
diameter and hosts a population of almost a million.
Unlike most Main Belt asteroids, Ceres has an icy
crust with a layer of liquid water beneath it, like a
miniature version of Jupiter’s moon, Europa. With
its abundant water, Ceres has a major role in resup-
plying other stations in the belt. Similar to Extropia,
Ceres operates largely along anarcho-capitalist lines.
However, the Hidden Concern, a cartel run entirely
by uplifted octopi, holds sway in the sub-crustal sea
and maintains a stranglehold, as it were, on water
extraction operations. Cerean octopoid morphs are
specially adapted to survive in the ammonia-rich
waters of the Hidden Sea.

EXTROPIA (44 NYSA)
This massive beehive habitat is a major crossroads
and anarcho-capitalist/mutualist marketplace. Ex-
tropia is a neutral free city whose infrastructure and
social fabric is maintained by a loose association of
anarcho-syndicalist affinity groups. Extropia’s neu-
trality hinges on strategic alliances between key local
figures, their networks, and an unusual array of out-
side interests that include the Lunar banks, techno-
libertarian factions, and outer system colonies depen-
dent upon raw materials exported from the belt. The
hypercorps use Extropia as a tax shelter and a haven
from which to do illicit business. There are no laws
or government as such; visitors are advised to register
with an insurance and security provider. Named after
one of the first transhumanist movements, Extropia
is considered a utopia for transhumans looking for
body modifications. AGIs and forking are accepted
and allowed here. The transhuman population is
nearly ten million.

NOVA YORK (METIS)
One of the more unusual near-weightless habitats is
Nova York, the main city on Metis, a large nickel-iron
and silicate asteroid located in the main belt. Nova
York, the third largest habitat in the main belt, is a
thriving metropolis of 500,000, with the main portion
of the city located in a spherical cavern approximately
four kilometers in diameter, the top of which is two
hundred meters beneath the asteroid’s surface. Lit
during the day by a series of huge light tubes in the
outer walls, at night the lights of the buildings cause
the surface of this sphere to resemble an enormous
geode. The habitat’s basic design consists of many
thousands of exceptionally tall and fragile-looking
buildings that extend between one hundred and fifteen
hundred meters above the surface, as well as a few
buildings that stretch from one side of the cavern to
the other. In Metis’s minute gravity of 1/140th of a g,
up and down have little meaning, and even relatively
fragile buildings are in no danger of falling down. The
vast majority of the buildings, including ones more
than one kilometer tall, are made from thin plastic
panels over a durable supporting framework. These
buildings jut out at all angles from the sphere.
   Many inhabitants of Nova York move from one
building to another by jumping, and a single leap can
carry someone many hundreds of meters. Residents
do not worry about falling—the combination of air
resistance and exceedingly low gravity means that
even someone falling from the top of the cavern to
the bottom is in no danger of injury. In this environ-
ment, the only real meaning of up and down is that
down is where you look for objects to come to rest
(as long as an air current does not pick them up and
blow them around).

JUPITER
Large enough that it could almost have formed the
nucleus of a protostar in its own right, Jupiter’s mas-
sive size makes the Jovian System one of the most
challenging places in the system to colonize. Jupiter’s
powerful magnetic field means that its inner moons—
and the outer ones, when their orbits pass through its
immense magnetotail—are bombarded with enough
ionizing radiation to kill transhumans not protected
by the heaviest of shielding within a matter of hours.
There are sixty-three moons and moonlets in the
Jovian system, but only the well-explored, populous,
regular moons are described here.

RESOURCES AND ECONOMY
Jupiter’s powerful gravity well is a major hindrance
to gas mining in the planet’s atmosphere, as even craft
that do not succumb to the violent, centuries-long
atmospheric storms can achieve escape velocity with
only the most powerful propulsion systems. Given the
need for heavy shielding on such craft, gas mining on
Jupiter is not nearly as efficient as on Saturn. Jupi-
ter has a tenuous ring system, much less dense than
Saturn’s, which extends out for 20,000 kilometers

%%% txt/100.txt
around the planet, encompassing the orbits of its two
closest moonlets.
   However, Jupiter’s gravity is also a valuable
resource. Craft bound for Saturn and beyond can
slingshot themselves outward by circling the planet
to pick up velocity, cutting months or years off their
trips. The heavily militarized Jovian Republic levies
tolls against all spacecraft using Jupiter’s gravity to
pick up velocity, including asteroids under propul-
sion. This protection money is the Junta’s primary
source of revenue. Planetary Consortium ships gener-
ally accept the payment as part of operating expens-
es. Other factions are not so cooperative, and the
Junta regularly seizes or destroys blockade runners.

HABITATS AND MOONLETS
Most of Jupiter’s moons are really captured aster-
oids, lacking the size and geological complexity of
planetary bodies. All are occupied. Some were con-
verted to habitats; others host only Junta military and
mining outposts. The Jovian moonlets consist mostly
of carbonaceous rock, poor in metal, with some of
the larger moonlets having layers or even cores of ice.
Beehive habitats and Reagan cylinders predominate in
the Jovian system. Reagan cylinders (called “sarcopha-
gus habs” by every other faction) are an inefficient
variation on the O’Neill cylinder in which excavators
hollow out an immense, cylindrical cavern in a rocky
asteroid and then alter the asteroid’s rotation with
external thrusters to simulate gravity.
   Other habitat types are rare in Jovian orbit, espe-
cially within 2 million kilometers of the planet, where
the radiation is strongest. For a bioconservative fac-
tion unwilling to adopt radiation-resistant morphs, the
Junta is in a poor location. Shielding their populace
beneath tons of rock is a necessity. Despite its military
hegemony, the Junta can’t control all of Jovian space,
and there are things it can’t do on its own—like ex-
ploring Europa. A number of unaligned habitats and
surface settlements exist in the ring system and the
orbits of the Galilean moons.
   The Jovian Republic has renamed Jupiter’s moons
after various neo-conservative heroes from Earth’s
history. From closest to most distant, the moonlets are
Metis (Bush), Adrastea (Fairway), Amalthea (Solano),
Thebe (McAllen), Leda (Chung), Himalia (Pinochet),
Lysithea (Friedman), Elara (Buckley), Ananke (Nixon),
Carme (Kissinger), Pasiphae (Schilling), and Sinope
(Garcia). All are tiny, between 5 and 100 kilometers
in diameter.

AMALTHEA (SOLANO)
The largest of the moonlets, hollow Amalthea is prob-
ably the most livable sarcophagus habitat due to the
large lake created from its icy core. Living on Solano
carries some prestige among Junta citizens. Rumor has
it that most of the residents are well-placed RAND
think tank personnel, most of whom work on defense
projects. A fusion-powered axial light tube illumi-
nates the 30-kilometer diameter central cavern, whose

%%% txt/101.txt
landscape is patterned after the subdivisions and office
parks of an early 21st-century suburb. All buildings
have envirosealing so that the occasional bouts of en-
vironmental sepsis resulting from the poorly regulated
interior ecosystem can be purged with toxin bombs.
Less fortunate support personnel dwell in the beehive
warrens crisscrossing the moonlet’s crust between
cavern and surface. Like most of Jupiter’s moonlets,
Amalthea’s space crawls with patrol craft and killsats,
making approach for unauthorized craft problematic
at best. 1.5 million transhumans live on Solano.

IO
Beneath Io’s tenuous, patchy atmosphere of volcanic
gases and neutral atomic dust lies a barren, grayish
yellow, rocky surface coated with a thin frost of sulfur
dioxide. Tidal heating caused by gravitational inter-
action with Jupiter makes Io the most volcanically
active body in the system—so active that the meteor
cratering found on every other planet and moon is
completely absent on Io. Massive volcanic calderas,
lakes of molten rock, and geysers of sulfur dot the
surface, with eruptions and accompanying seismic
activity lasting months or years. Volcanic zones on
Io reach surface temperatures of up to 1,500 degrees
Kelvin, hotter than any body in the system.
   For all that, transhumanity’s worst peril on Io is
radiation. Ejecta from geysers and volcanoes flow
with Jupiter’s magnetic field to form a titanic, toroidal
flux tube that rotates with Io around the gas giant.
Travelers to Io must either use the heaviest radiation
shielding available or resleeve into synthetic morphs.
   Transhuman activity on Io centers around scientific
research and harvesting the volatiles ejected by Io’s
geysers, particularly sulfur. Bases tend to be modular
and mobile due to the ever-changing seismic activity.
The Junta’s most notorious prison, Maui Patera Reha-
bilitation Center, is dug into a (mostly) extinct caldera
wall north of the equator.

EUROPA
Europa has no atmosphere and lies within the fear-
some magnetosphere of Jupiter, and as such its surface
is bombarded with enough radiation for an unshielded
transhuman to receive an irrevocably fatal dosage
within a few days—much faster when Europa’s orbit
passes through Jupiter’s immense magnetotail. As a
result, transhumans on Europa dwell beneath the icy
crust, largely in the ocean below, adopting a variety of
aquatic and amphibious morphs for survival. The only
surface facilities are the heavily-shielded ice elevator
heads at Conamara Chaos and several other points
through which reactor mass and other crucial supplies
can be delivered to the Europans below.
   Transhumanity is still exploring and imaging the
Europan ocean floor, a task complicated by the hid-
eous pressures at work in these waters, which are ten
times as deep as the Earth’s oceans. A further surprise
awaiting transhumanity was the terrain. The geology
of Europa suggested that beneath the ice would be
fathomless depths of black water ending at a depth of
nearly 500 kilometers in a relatively flat, featureless
sea bed. Were Europa a lifeless ball of ice and rock,
this would be the case, but over the estimated billion
years since the rise of life on Europa, tiny lithoderms
(analogs to Earth’s coral) have built silicate reefs that
rise to within a few hundred meters of the ice crust. It
is on these biologically formed mountain tops, home
to complex ecosystems, that the Europans have built
their habitats.
   While based on water-carbon chemistry like life
of Terran origin, life on Europa is completely autoc-
thonic, having originated beneath an impenetrable ice
sheet that cut off Europa’s subsurface ocean complete-
ly from outside. This is in marked contrast to Terran
life, which many biologists have theorized might be
the result of galactic panspermia, the slow diffusion of
microbes through the vacuum of space aboard comets
or asteroids. As such, the fauna of Europa are of great
interest to transhuman bioscience.

BIOSCIENCES
Europa’s lifeforms, unique perhaps in the universe,
are its greatest treasure, and transhumanity’s efforts
to catalog them are only beginning. The rush to ex-
ploit Europan biodivesity puts the Jovian Junta in an
uncomfortable situation. While they control space
traffic and commerce in the Jovian system, they lack
the native talent to take real advantage of knowledge
gleaned from Europa. At first, they engaged in ham-
fisted excise operations aimed at squeezing revenue
out of knowledge exports. But once farcasters and
egocasters came online below the ice, this type of
extortion no longer worked. Now the Jovians have
shifted to a two-pronged strategy of levying tariffs
on new equipment and people brought down the ice
elevators by hypercorps and research collectives, and
of holding the entire population of the moon hostage
by refusing delivery of key resources like reactor mass
and rare elements if protection fees are not paid.

HABITATS
Europan habitats take two forms: fortified fishing and
farming havens clinging to the spires of the lithoder-
mic reefs, and spherical bubble warrens constructed
by boring into the lower reaches of the ice crust and
shoring up the hollows created. The latter are the only
air-filled spaces beneath the ice. The largest warren is
Conamara, at the base of the Conamara Chaos ice
elevator. Conamara is surrounded by five nearby reef
havens, also considered part of the habitat. The total
population is 1.5 million.

GANYMEDE AND CALLISTO
Nearly as large in size as Luna, but darkly colored
and not as heavily cratered, Ganymede and Callisto
are very similar worlds. Neither is as dense (nor has
as much gravity), as their mantles consist of more ice
than iron rock. Both possess abundant volatiles and
water (albeit frozen), making them ideal candidates

%%% txt/102.txt
for habitation. Ganymede, with its differentiated sur-
face of rocky and icy terrain, has an iron core and thus
a faint magnetic field. Callisto, the smaller of the two,
is composed mostly of icy silicate clays. As on Luna,
most cities on Ganymede and Callisto are built below
ground to shield them from meteor impacts (and, on
Ganymede, from Jupiter’s radioactive bombardment).
   While within the “protection” of the Jovian Re-
public, both moons are a patchwork of city-states.
Some are full members of the Jovian polity, while
others are only tolerated. Ganymede tends to swing
more heavily toward the Junta, as its citizens still
see the Junta-maintained infrastructure—accurately
or not—as necessary in such a hostile environment.
Callisto, outside the worst radioactive effects of the
Jovian magnetosphere, is an easier place for techno-
progressivism to gain a foothold.

HYODEN
The nucleus of this city-state was a research station
founded by a coalition of Pacific Rim nations in Calli-
sto’s Valhalla region, a massive primordial impact zone
where the icy subsurface lies exposed, simplifying ex-
traction of clean water. When the Fall came, Hyoden,
which had long faced labor shortages, opened itself
to those refugees who could make it to Jupiter. Now
Hyoden has two million inhabitants, making it the
largest city-state on Callisto and the largest non-Junta
state in the Jovian system. Hyoden is itself heavily
militarized, as the tendency of the local authorities to
turn a blind eye toward operatives using their territory
for forays against the Junta makes for uneasy relations
with their powerful neighbor.

LIBERTY
Situated along the southern edge of the vast, rocky
plain called Galileo Regio, almost on Ganymede’s
equator, Liberty (population 7 million) is the Junta’s
largest planetary city-state. It is closely tied to Liberty
Station, a major shipyard and defense installation in
geosynchronous orbit. Major industries include ship-
building, space construction, fabrication, and security
products and services. The Castle, the central security
network point from which all surveillance data col-
lected in the Junta is monitored and processes, is
rumored to be in or near Liberty. Liberty is mostly
underground, but it boasts a number of parks in ar-
mored surface domes. If one were to spend enough
time topside, one would see the deceleration torches of
incoming metal asteroids from the belt bound for the
shipyards lighting up the sky several times a day.


THE TROJANS
(JOVIAN TROJAN AND GREEK ASTEROIDS)
The Trojans and Greeks are two 600 million-kilome-
ter-long arcs of scattered, icy rock asteroids sharing
the orbit of Jupiter. They orbit in the stable L4 and
L5 points sixty degrees ahead of and behind the giant
planet. Mars and Neptune also have Trojan asteroids,
but when someone speaks of, “the Trojans,” they’re
normally talking about the Jovian groups. In the early
days, L4 asteroids (ahead of Jupiter) are named after
Greek heroes of Homer’s Iliad; L5 asteroids (trailing
Jupiter) are named after heroes of Troy. Asteroids
discovered more recently break the old convention, as
there are far more objects in the Trojans than there
were characters in the Iliad.
   Politically, the Trojans and Greeks may be thought
of as a collection of sometimes overlapping neighbor-
hoods whose inhabitants tend to group around par-
ticular cultures, factions, and sometimes languages.
A neighborhood in the Trojans might span anywhere
from 250,000 to 2 million kilometers at its widest
point. Within neighborhoods, almost everyone knows
one other. Because of the wide dispersion of resources,
Trojan habitats tend to be small—from one to two
thousand people—and built largely along scum barge
or cluster lines (although it is never advisable to refer
to someone’s habitat as a scum barge unless they refer
to it that way first).

RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS
Although the sheer size of the two regions means
a lot of cultural diversity, anarcho-collectivism is a
powerful meme here and the reputation economy is
prevalent. On one hand, neighborhoods, habitats,
and even individuals are expected to be self-sufficient.
Unlike the denser Main Belt, the Trojans lack the
safety net provided by pervasive transhuman pres-
ence. The ideal Trojan or Greek is a Neo-Renaissance
being, incredibly competent in a wide variety of fields.
A person who can’t maneuver in zero g; maintain
their gear, ship, and hab; and navigate between rocks
and habitats can have a tough time surviving. At the
same time, a spirit of cooperation prevails. Bartering
services or even gifting them to gain reputation is
common. Everyone appreciates a specialist, as long
as they’re not specialized at the expense of baseline
self-sufficiency.
   Prospecting and salvage are major activities in
the Trojans, where metals and rare elements are
scarce and settlers don’t usually have the economic
muscle to import raw materials from elsewhere.
However, the Trojans are rich in silicates, volatiles,
and carbonaceous materials. Necessity has led to
many innovations in materials science. Beyond the
simple problem of raw materials, the widely scat-
tered habitats of the Trojans have to be wildly in-
ventive on many levels to retain their independence.
New robot, morph, and vehicle designs appear all
the time, enabling an unusual array of business and
leisure activities, like whaling (organizing a flash
flotilla to rapidly mine asteroids and comets with er-
ratic orbits as they pass near the Trojans), mekking
(simulated—or sometimes real—combat between
robotic suits or synthetic morphs on uninhab-
ited asteroids with interesting terrain), and shrining
(stealthing up on another habitat and resurfacing it
with nanosculpters to create an art object—mostly a
scum barge pastime).

LOCUS
Locus is the largest cluster habitat ever formed. It
is still growing, with over one million inhabitants
in the habitat proper and another million in the
nearby suburbs of scum barges and small asteroid
stations. Locus is located in Cassandra’s Reach, one
of the denser regions in the L5 Trojans. The habitat
is positioned at the center of mass around which the
two asteroids making up the binary object Patro-
clus orbit one another. Both Patroclus asteroids are
themselves inhabited and hold defense installations,
mines, and refineries.
   The design of Locus is very similar to the much
smaller Lot 49, but Locus is eleven kilometers in di-
ameter and somewhat irregular in shape, as growth
along some spars is faster than others. A quarter of its
total volume is cut out in a roughly conical shape all
the way to the Amoeba, an immense, softly glowing
sculpture at the center of the habitat. Some differences
from smaller Trojan clusters are dictated by Locus’s
size. The immense structural spars radiating from the
habitat’s center are hollow, with arterial floatways and
elevator-trams running inside of them. Lesser spars
run between the arterial spars, providing more moor-
ing points for modules. Adjacent to each arterial spar
are wide “roads” leading to the edge of the habitat so
that modules can maneuver out if the owners decide
to leave.
   Beneath the shimmering mesh stretched over the
geodesic frame to keep out micro-asteroids, tens of
thousands of small ships and habitat modules moored
along the spars pulse with an ever-changing array
of lights. Habitat modules and large ships are asked
to stay out of the conical empty space. This space
teems with small craft and people on thrustpacks or
voidscooters as they cross the habitat, play zero-g
games, or visit the free-floating spimes and sculptures
that dot the area. The Amoeba, which periodically
changes color and shape based on its resident AI’s
programming (often it looks like some sort of animal),

> Welcome to Locus (FIXME)

serves as a central reference point for navigation.
When someone gives the address for a module, it is
as a point on a spherical coordinate system with the
Amoeba at its center. Large ships and shuttles dock on
the outer surface of the habitat, at the terminal points
of the arterial spars.
   Locus was founded by a joint anarchist-argonaut
venture and was the fi rst major stronghold for
the autonomist factions. Unlike Extropia, which
has the tacit blessing of the Planetary Consortium
and encourages the presence of security and insur-
ance companies, Locus runs on a pure reputation
economy. Security, maintenance, expansion, and
defense of the habitat are all performed by vol-
unteers. Inhabitants interested in security monitor
incoming ships and operate crowdsourcing systems
that dispatch volunteers to perform WMD scans on
new arrivals. Ships that won’t submit to a scan are
asked to leave. If they don’t, anyone who’s designed
a cool new weapons system recently is welcome to
take a shot.
   Locus is one focal point in a cold war between the
hypercorp-aligned inner system powers and a loose
coalition of outer system interests. While saboteurs
from the Planetary Consortium and other hostile
entities can and do occasionally cause trouble on
Locus, the hypercorps are currently unwilling to
attempt a direct military attack on the habitat. The
first time they tried, the Planetary Consortium and
the Martian city-state of Valles-New Shanghai sent
a small expeditionary fleet. The interlopers were
caught completely off-guard by a fierce and well-
coordinated defense. Six months later, they sent a
much larger fleet. Help arrived from elsewhere in the
Trojans and Greeks and from Titan, whose citizens
took a dim view of any Planetary Consortium ex-
pansion beyond the belt. The Titanians now main-
tain a permanent base near Locus. Rumor has it they
agreed to a mutual defense pact with one of Locus’
citizens, possibly the famous programmer-armsman
Teilhard Liu.

LOT 49
Lot 49 is moored to the small asteroid 28349 Pynchon
in the amorphous Vonarburg-Shadyside neighbor-
hood, toward the center of the L4 Greeks. Vonarburg-
Shadyside is named after two rocks that roughly
delimit its 500,000-kilometer length along the arc of
Jupiter’s orbit. Neighboring habitats within 100,000
kilometers (with populations) include Craftsbury
(450), Greenview (28), and Blackhawk (1020). With a
population of 400, this station is more or less typical
of the Trojans in terms of layout.
   From the outside, Lot 49 looks like a shiny, meshed-
over geodesic sphere, 800 meters in diameter, with
numerous protruding instrument spars and some
triangles left open to space so that shuttles can pass
through. The mooring to the asteroid is temporary in
case a potential collision is detected. Inside, a central
utility module with a communal reactor, factories,
and machine bay is surrounded by evenly spaced but
irregularly shaped habitat modules in a riot of colors
and lighting schemes. Structural spars and floatways
connect everything. One entire spar is given over to a
rotating cylindrical module that generates about 0.7 g
and contains medical, cloning, resleeving, and darknet
egocasting facilities.
   Lot 49’s population and most of their neighbors
in Vonarburg-Shadyside tend to align with the scum
and anarchist factions and speak a mixture of English,
Portuguese, and Thai. Lot 49 is in a densely inhabited
part of the Greeks, placing it near a crossroads. Main
economic activities include shuttle design, whaling,
and ferrying people and goods around the region.

SATURN
The second largest planet in the system is a much
more favorable habitat for transhumans than Jupiter.
Saturn’s lower gravity and milder magnetosphere are
a boon to gas mining operations, and for resource-
hungry habs, the Rings are a feast (literally, in the case
of the new Hamilton cylinder type habitats). Hyper-
corps have a presence here, but any major expansion
by the Planetary Consortium is kept in check by the

> GATE EXPEDITION REPORT 901127

anarchist stations of the Rings and the technosocialist
Commonwealth of Titan.
   Because Saturn is so distant from the Sun, solar
power generation is extremely inefficient. Growing
photosynthetic plants with sunlight is impossible
without large arrays of mirrors to focus the light. The
abundance of water and volatiles makes the rings
ideal for both scum barges and Hamilton cylinders.
Gas mining is vital to the survival of almost every
habitat and moon settlement in the Saturnian system,
so habitats located further out from the planet that
wish to be self-sufficient almost always maintain their
own gas mining stations close to the planet. Security
for these installations and the atmospheric skimmers
and tankers they dispatch is tight, and it is never ad-
visable to approach one unannounced.

RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS
Gas mining on Saturn supplies thirty percent of the
system’s reactor mass. This role is expected to grow
as Helium-3 deposits in the Lunar regolith become
less accessible. For ships traveling to the far reaches
of the outer system, Saturn is an important alterna-
tive to using Jupiter for gravity assists. Less restric-
tive than Jovian regimes and richer in resources than
the Trojans, Circumsaturnine habs and settlements
are important innovators in habitat design and cul-
tural organization. Since the discovery of the Pandora
Gates, the Titanian Commonwealth is the only entity
actively pursuing interstellar exploration through
conventional means.

THE RINGS AND CLASSICAL MINOR MOONS
Saturn’s rings are made up of countless small icy ob-
jects, most of which range in size from dust specks to
boulders 10 meters in diameter. The rings are desig-
nated by the letters “A” through “F” in the order in
which they were discovered. They vary in thickness
between 100 and 1000 meters and in width from
20,000 kilometers down to just meters. In places there
are gaps between rings. The widest, the Cassini divi-
sion, is 4,000 kilometers across.

GATEWAY (PANDORA)
The Gateway settlement, on Saturn’s outer shep-
herd moon Pandora, holds the first publicly known
wormhole gate. The Gatekeeper Corporation keeps
the gate open as a means of exploration and scientific
investigation for all factions and powers. Gatekeeper
was originally a Titanian microcorp but is now inde-
pendent. The Commonwealth of Titan still holds a
major stake in it, though not a controlling interest.
Granting autonomy to Gatekeeper Corporation was
a diplomatic maneuver made in response to Planetary
Consortium claims that the Titanians sought hege-
mony in the outer system. So far, Titan’s neighbors are
buying it, even if the Planetary Consortium doesn’t.

HYPERION
With its chaotic, virtually unpredictable rotation, Hy-
perion is a dangerous place to land ships. It remains
uninhabited.

IAPETUS
Iapetus is one of Saturn’s larger icy moons and once
boasted a population of 200,000 living in the dense
warrens of Analect, its main settlement. Probably be-
cause it is one of the few large moons of Saturn that
contains sizable deposits of silicates and minerals in
addition to ice, Iapetus was a target of the TITANs
during the Fall. After enslaving a tenth of the popu-
lace as worker drones and using the rest as seed stock
for tissue cultures to feed their fellows, the TITANs
began to build what appears to have been a matri-
oshka brain. Iapetus now occupies twice the volume
it once did, the ice and silicate of the planet’s outer
layers having been reworked into a delicate lattice of
circuitry millions of layers deep.
   Strangely, the project simply stalled at some point
prior to completion. Speculation has it that the
controlling intelligence was either destroyed by an
unknown outside force or devoured itself in a fit of
compuational ecstasy. Whatever the case, the drones
simply stopped working and died and the moon’s au-
tomated defense grid went dead, leaving a strangely
beautiful but lifeless machine behind to slowly decay
from meteor impacts and gravitational stress. Several
research teams now reside in small orbital stations,
quarreling over the scraps. Rumor has it that a
number of researchers trying to understand the ma-
trioshka circuitry have lost their minds in the process,
perhaps by some mechanism akin to a basilisk hack.
It is also believed that some of the moon’s internal
defenses remain active. If anyone has plumbed the
interior and come back, they’re not talking about it.

MEATHAB
The full name of this unique habitat is Turn Yourself
Into a Giant Mass of Space Meat for Art!, and as the
name implies, 90% of the habitat’s structure consists
of fast-cultured vat bacon, battened on the abun-
dant resources of the ring system. MeatHab started
out as someone’s art morph, but then, against all
expectations, squatters moved in. MeatHab now has
a population of 500. Similar to a Hamilton cylinder,
the kilometer-long habitat harvests and processes ring
material to grow itself. The outer surface is frozen
flesh ten meters thick whose surface resembles a cross
between a tree trunk and flank steak. Past the axial
space dock is a warren of veinous, skin-covered cor-
ridors lit by bioluminescent panels and maintained by
small, reptilian symbiotes that eat away dead skin and
may have other immune functions as well. Gravity
inside is 0.5 g.
   The nameless biodesigner who created the
place—and who may or may not still inhabit the
gigantic morph—was a genius. Although the habitat
is not by any stretch of the imagination a pleas-
ant locale, it appears healthy. Its full workings are
not understood, and the inhabitants range from
extreme flesh freaks who are fans of the artist to se-
rious biodesigners studying the place to learn more
about its construction.

MIMAS (HARMONIOUS ANARCHY)
Led by legendary Chinese dissident poet Hao Lin
Ngai, Harmonious Anarchy broke from the Fa Jing
cartel during the tumultuous years prior to the Fall.
Hao sought to create a society in the spirit of the
ancient Taoist state of Great Perfection that existed
in Szechuan 1,700 years earlier—with considerable
updates from modern thought. Harmonious Anarchy
is an Extropian mutualist society heavily involved in
software engineering, logistics, and relocation of me-
tallic asteroids to the outer system. Most of Mimas is
a very low-g beehive arranged into Black, Red, Yellow,
Green, and White neighborhoods, based on the five
classical directions of Chinese mythology. Each color
boasts an ornate central cavern, with extended fami-
lies living in radiating subwarrens. While adhering to
mutalist economic principles, Harmonious Anarchy
simultaneously takes a traditional Chinese approach
to social organization, with family at its core.

NORSE, INUIT, AND GALLIC MOONLETS
In addition to the classical satellites described here,
three groups of small objects unknown to early
astronomers orbit the planet. These moonlets are
designated as the Inuit, Gallic, and Norse groups.
Because these moonlets were still little explored by
the time of the Fall, most of them remain sparsely
populated. With a few exceptions, inhabitants of the
moonlets are generally people who want to be left
alone. The exceptions are Skathi and Abramsen (for-
merly S/2007 S 2), which, along with Phoebe, were
captured and moved into Titan’s orbit, where they
serve as defense installations.

PAN (IZULU)
Volkograad’s closest competitor is this anarcho-
capitalist outfit, most of whose founders were South
African. iZulu has a somewhat lower capacity than
Volkograad but will ship reactor mass to unusual

%%% txt/107.txt
locations like the Trojans and the Kuiper Belt. iZulu is
a very crowded beehive with nearly 400,000 inhabit-
ants and an unusually large number of infugees. The
nations of sub-Saharan Africa were only starting to
achieve widespread 20th century-levels of prosperity
in the late 21st, and so they had the lowest capacity to
physically evacuate their citizens during the Fall of any
region on Earth. iZulu and a handful of other habitats
with roots in Africa thus have high infomorph popula-
tions and millions of people in dead storage.

PHELAN’S RECOURSE
Phelan’s Recourse (usually just called “Phelan’s” by
inhabitants) is the largest nomadic settlement in the
system, with a population estimated around 250,000.
Phelan’s is a swarm of some 10,000 small craft and tin
can habitat modules that orbits Saturn along a highly
elliptical path somewhat inclined to the plane of the
ecliptic. The swarm’s orbit is calculated to maximize
the number of encounters with near moons and sta-
tions, providing a six to eight hour window in which
craft can leave the swarm for trade. Phelan’s Recourse
passes through the rings once a month, allowing craft
to resupply with water and volatiles.
   Phelan’s accepts all comers. One could meet just
about anyone here, from the government in exile of
East Timor to Hasidim from Brooklyn. The core of
the swarm is the Stills, a fusion-illuminated grain
farm and distillery operated by an allegedly reformed
gang of Irish travelers who conned their way off
Earth a few weeks before the Fall and escaped to
the outer system. The Stills produce Phelan’s Ma, the
most sought-after whiskey in the system, and Phelan’s
Da, possibly the worst beer ever made. Despite the
Phelans’ protestations of legitimacy, the criminal
element is heavily represented here. The swarm
represents an important link in red and gray market
supply chains.

PROMETHEUS (MARSEILLES)
Marseilles (population 80,000) is a beehive habitat
operated by the Titanians. It is rumored to harbor an
antimatter factory, a theory supported by the large
number of skimmers that arrive from the surface rela-
tive to the number of tankers that leave.

RHEA (KRONOS CLUSTER)
At a 764 kilometer diameter, Rhea is Saturn’s second
largest moon. Composed almost entirely of ice, Rhea’s
surface is sparsely inhabited, but a population of over
800,000 dwells in Kronos Cluster, a major habitat
in orbit. Kronos Cluster’s mass microfactured violet
spherical modules make it look like an immense, irreg-
ular bunch of grapes suspended in space, an impres-
sion added to by the winding space dock (nicknamed
the Vine) extending from the wider end. Within the
mass of habitat modules, the Vine branches out in all
directions, forming massive central arteries and twist-
ing side passages. These can be traversed by pushing
off hand and toeholds on the walls, or by catching
hold of fast-moving grab loops that move along “fast
lanes” in the walls of major floatways.
   Nearly five kilometers long and three wide, Kronos
has major problems with crowding and infrastructure
that have kept it from growing to the same size as
Locus. The designers simply did not plan for the size
the place might reach, and as a result another 150,000
people live in suburbs of tin can habs and scum barges
in the space around the habitat.
   Kronos can be an extremely dangerous place.
Insurance companies don’t like operating here, and
the habitat is a patchwork of criminal and anarchist
neighborhoods. Anarchist neighborhoods are generally
heavily armed and safe, but a trip from an anarchist
holding to the spaceport is best done with a group of
well-armed friends. Criminal neighborhoods are only
safe if you’re in the neighborhood’s controlling gang,
and even then conflicts flare up regularly.
   The situation is exacerbated by the Kronos Port
Authority, a junta of ultimates who operate security
for the spaceport. Originally an Extropian hypercorp,
the KPA fell into the hands of the ultimates when
they decided that they could profit more directly
by owning the company outright than by working
as hired muscle. They violently ousted the original
management and now use indentures in worker pods
to maintain the port. This situation is tolerated by
the local crime bosses and loathed by the mostly-
anarchist autonomist citizens, but so far no one is
able to challenge the KPA, which enforces use of the
port rather than any other mooring point with kill-
sats and artillery.

TETHYS (GODWINHEAD)
Composed almost entirely of ice, Tethys is one of Sat-
urn’s larger moons and the site of Ithaca Chasma, a
2,000-kilometer long valley covering three-quarters of
Tethys’s circumference. Fifteen years ago, prospectors
from an ethnically Indo-British autonomist collective
called the Rioters touched down on Godwin Head, a
projection in the chasm wall so named because it re-
sembles a headland projecting out into the sea. Instru-
ments on their ship, the Caleb Williams, had detected
what looked like mineral deposits in the ice, rare on
Tethys. What they found instead were relics thrust
to the surface by a geological event eons earlier, the
remains of primordial life that became extinct millions
of years ago when Tethys cooled and its subsurface
ocean froze over.
   Godwinhead is now a dense, efficient settlement
of 200,000 built into the five kilometer high canyon
walls. The central point of the town is the Caleb Wil-
liams, which has been towed back into a sheltering
cavern in the wall and converted into a communal
workshop and town hall. The face of the valley wall
is honeycombed with excavated ice caves hosting
habitat modules, connected by conduits to a com-
munal utility grid. The trusswork and cabling for the
utility system is also the public transit system, easily
traversed in the minute Tethyan gravity. The unofficial

%%% txt/108.txt
mascot of Godwinhead is the Tethyan Flatworm, a
two millimeter-long translucent worm that represent-
ed the pinnacle of Tethyan evolution. A large number
of the inhabitants are involved in biosciences, xenopa-
leontology, and prospecting for frozen lifeforms.
   Tethys shares its orbit with its Trojan moons
Telesto and Calypso, both of which are small and
sparsely populated.

TITAN
Saturn’s largest moon is shrouded in a permanent
orange atmospheric haze, hellishly cold (averaging
180 degrees below), and whipped by winds produced
by tidal forces four times stronger than those influenc-
ing the Earth’s climate. On its face, it appears even
less hospitable than the airless balls of ice and rock
comprising every world between Titan and Mars. The
meager sunlight reaching its surface is insufficient to
grow any but the hardiest plants, the mostly-nitrogen
atmosphere is dangerously toxic, and the surface
is dotted with lakes and seas of liquid methane. In
spite of all this, abundant hydrocarbons, a thick at-
mosphere, and diverse chemistry make Titan one of
the few worlds in the system where colonists may rely
entirely on local resources. Titan’s population is now
over 60 million.
   Social money and the microcorp system have led
to some spectacular gains and failures. On the up
side, Titan’s civil resleeving industry produces more
morphs than Mars and Luna combined. Massive
infrastructure programs have provided enough space
for 60 million people to live comfortably on a hostile
world. The Large Collider, the biggest particle accel-
erator ever produced, in polar orbit, enables physics
experiments that can be performed nowhere else in
the system. And two years ago, Titan dispatched the
first conventional interstellar probe, the Aubade. It
will reach Proxima Centauri in just under 20 years.
   On the down side, Titan’s “body for every mind”
law burdens the civic resleeving system with a lot of
people who no one would ever have bothered resleev-
ing otherwise. The failure of the Scoop project, an
extremely costly attempt to build a pipeline from
Saturn’s surface to low orbit, allowing massive gas
extraction without costly atmospheric skimmer op-
erations, stymied Titan’s ambitions to become a major
antimatter producer. Titan does produce antimatter,
but on a much smaller scale than was envisioned
when the Scoop project began.
   Commonly spoken languages on Titan include
Norsk, Francais, Deut ch, Mandarin, Svensk, Dansk,
and Suomi. Most citizens inhabit hazers, a tall, fine-
boned morph with very similar characteristics to the
Martian ruster. Parapelagia for gliding and flying
in the light Titanian gravity are a common biomod.
Titanians do three years of compulsory civil service
at the age of majority, with an emphasis on military
and security forces except for conscientious objecters.
Every citizen who has done military service is part of
the militia and has an assault weapon in their home.

AARHUS
Located near Titan’s south pole on the shores of On-
tario Lacus, a wide, shallow sea of liquid methane,
Aarhus (population five million) was the first site of
human habitation on Titan, chosen for its proximity
to abundant hydrocarbons. The city is the physical
hub of Titan Autonomous University (TAU) and hosts
numerous other academic institutions, most notably
Titan Tech, a major engineering school. Unlike Mar-
tian universities, which have few physical campus
buildings, TAU and other Titanian schools draw
many of their students from the widely scattered
habitats of the outer system, where delays in radio
communication make distance learning ineffective.
Fully 20% of Aarhus’s population are students, many
of them offwordlers.
   Aarhus’s layout is typical of Titanian cities. Three
central domes are surrounded by numerous smaller
structures, including lesser domes, fusion plants, and
industrial outbuildings, the most massive of which is
the now-abandoned methane utility plant on the lake
shore. The dome interiors are hung with lighting rods
and heavily built up with tall, narrow buildings, most
of which have upper decks where hazers on the wing
and pedal-powered microlights can land. Exterior
structures usually have outer walls built of ice for
shielding and structural support with internal walls
extruded from local silicates. Many buildings are a
rich azure or other shades of blue for contrast with
the ever-present orange glow of the Titanian sky.
   Unlike most Titanian cities, Aarhus relies primarily
on fusion power. Aarhus is the center of Titan’s native
preservationist movement, which opposes inefficient
use of native hydrocarbon resources due to possible
long term effects on Titan’s climate.

NEW QUEBEC
New Quebec lies on a plain in the Aaru region sur-
rounded by endless rippling dunes shaped by Titan’s
powerful winds. The region’s diverse chemical resourc-
es supply the colossal nurseries that have made New
Quebec the system’s largest single producer of morphs.
   The city is 50 kilometers from Montmorency Lacus,
a 20 kilometer-wide crater lake of liquid ethane and
methane. Originally thought to be an impact crater,
rare on Titan, geological studies later showed it to be
the collapsed remains of an extinct cryovolcano. Situ-
ated in a rainy area, the lacus slowly drains over the
crater lip at Montmorency Cascade, a 200 meter car-
bonfall that empties into a series of alluvial channels
from which the Quebecoise pump its output for fuel.
   The St. Catherine Tong, the most dangerous native
Titanian mob, is based in New Quebec. Titanian law
is generally very permissive regarding individual free-
doms, so the vices this gang trades in are of the black-
est: snuff pods, stolen alpha forks, and nanoweaponry.
A ready supply of fresh morphs bought from corrupt
microcorp nursery administrators further fuels their
rackets. The Tong is extremely violent and a major
embarrassment to Commonwealth security forces.

NYHAVN
Set near the equa-
tor amid the rolling ice
hills of the Xanadu region,
Nyhavn (population 12 mil-
lion) is the largest city in the outer
system and the capital of the Titanian
Commonwealth. Nyhavn’s massive cen-
tral dome, with its elegant blue towers and
bioengineered parklands, rivals New Shanghai
in size and ambition. Three surrounding domes
and a sprawl of subsidiary structures are connected
by high-clearance flyways, where ground vehicles
and microlights form a steady stream of traffic at all
hours. At the same time, the squalid blandness that
prevails in the Martian suburbs and outlying souks
is absent; the dwellings and neighborhoods of the
Titanian working class display a riot of color and
design, empowered by public fabricators limited by
none of the enforced scarcity of Martian economics.
For all its idealism, the Plurality is not immune to a
desire to showcase its achievements.
   Outside the city is a pipeline leading from the
vast Tyska Lacus, 100 kilometers distant. Common-
wealth Skyport, Titan’s principal spaceport, offers
quick access to Commonwealth Hub, the Titan sys-
tem’s long-haul space dock, located in geostationary
orbit above the city. The surrounding countryside
is dotted with smaller settlements connected to
Nyhavn by trains and a well-developed network of
surface roads.
   Nyhavn is a major media center, with daily life
closely attentive to the debates and decisions of
the Plurality. At the same time, it is a cosmopolitan
place, where Titan’s microcorp movers rub shoulders
with visiting anarchist traders and (less commonly)
legations from the inner system. There is an active
underworld, despite the efforts of security forces,
with the local St. Catherine Tong engaged in continu-
al low-intensity warfare with triads from throughout
the system.

PHOEBE, SKATHI, AND ABRAMSEN
After the conflict at Locus, the Plurality became
embroiled in a hot debate regarding the dangers of
hypercorp adventurism in the outer system. It was
generally felt that the Planetary Consortium hoped to
keep the outer system in a position similar to where
the United States kept Latin America by meddling in
its affairs throughout the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, and that the only counter to this was a
show of force. Titan’s thick atmospheric haze makes
ground-based space defense systems considerably
less effective than on other worlds, but satellites and
space platforms were too vulnerable to serve as com-
mand and control centers.
   The solution was to capture three of Saturn’s small
retrograde moons—Phoebe, Skathi, and Abramsen
(once designated S/2007 S 2, now renamed after a
pioneering Titanian economist). Phoebe is the largest
of the three objects. The other two
were maneuvered into the system’s L4
and L5 points. The calculations required
to relocate these bodies were painstak-
ing, and the energy expenditure tremendous,
but all three now serve as major components of
Titan’s orbital defense grid. Whether the system cre-
ated thereby is impregnable has yet to be tested.

URANUS
Once thought of as gas giants like Saturn and Ju-
piter, Uranus and Neptune differ from the larger
planets in that they contain large amounts of water
ice, methane, and ammonia and have rocky cores at
their centers. This region of the system is sparsely
populated. Uranus orbits at a distance 10 AU beyond
the orbit of Saturn, 20 times the distance of the Earth
from the sun.
   Uranus, the coldest planet in the solar system, is a
blue-green sphere of ice and gas. Seen from afar, it is
virtually featureless compared to Saturn and Jupiter,
but up close subtle cloud formations and a tenuous
ring system may be observed. Probably due to a colli-
sion with an Earth-sized world when the solar system
was young, Uranus rotates on its side, such that one
pole faces the sun for 42 years at a stretch, and its
moons orbit at a sharp angle to the solar ecliptic.
   At the time of Eclipse Phase, Uranus’s south pole
is experiencing its south polar mid-spring, during
which thick methane clouds darken the polar atmo-
sphere. It may be the unusual tilt of its axis and the
accompanying strange seasonal weather that give
rise to the unconfirmed rumor that the alien traders
called the Factors have created a settlement hidden
in Uranus’s atmosphere.

CHAT NOIR AND FISSURE GATE
Located on Oberon, this is the Uranian system’s pri-
mary long haul spaceport, with a permanent popu-
lation of 8,000. Chat Noir has fairly advanced ego-
casting, resleeving, and manufacturing facilities for a
frontier outpost and is operated by several collectives
of anarchists. The reason for all the infrastructure
is Fissure Gate, the only Pandora Gate in anarchist
hands (despite several Planetary Consortium expedi-
tions to wrest control of it).
   Fissure Gate was discovered by a prospecting ex-
pedition from Chat Noir, then a tiny outpost. Seeking
deposits of the useful carbonaceous ices that make up
about 20% of Oberon’s mass, they instead chanced
upon subsurface radio emissions near the foot of Mt.
Hippolyta. After using triangulating the source, the
prospectors landed and used subsurface imaging gear.
What they got back was a blurry image of a rock fis-
sure containing an ambiguous mass of mixed density
and an extremely dense, possibly metallic object with
a shape too regular to be anything but a structure
or large artifact—all under 500 meters of ages-old
frozen cryovolcanic outflow. The gate at Pandora was
already publicly known at this time, so the prospec-
tors drilled down, suspecting they’d found an alien
artifact. They were not to be disappointed, although
the discovery yielded gruesome salvage: the barely
recognizable corpses of eleven gatecrashers.
   Why and how the Fissure Gate was erected under
the ice remains a complete mystery. At some recent
point, however, it was completely buried, with only
a thin pocket of space between it and the surround-
ing ice. When the eleven emerged, buried in an
airless space beneath 500 meters of ice, there was
barely room to move, let alone escape—but the gate
wouldn’t let them back through. Several of the crew
had recoverable cortical stacks. This lucky handful are
now prominent citizens of Chat Noir, but none plan
to resume gatecrashing as a career.
   The Fissure Gate remains in anarchist hands,
operated and defended by the Love and Rage Col-
lective. The gate is made available to almost anyone
unless their rep score is tanked or they are pursuing
commercial interests (ruling out most hypercorps).
Support for gatecrashers is minimal—traverse the
threshold at your own risk. Any discoveries made via
this gate, however, must be shared for the collective
good of transhumanity.

TITANIA AND OBERON
Uranus’s two largest moons are sparsely populated,
with only about 10,000 transhumans living on each
body. Most stations are mixed dome and beehive set-
tlements and range from hypercorp communications
and research outposts to autonomist freeholds. The
pair are more chemically complex than most moons in
the outer system, consisting of about 30% rock, 20%
methane and similar carbonaceous ices, and 50%
water. Titania is home to a spectacular canyon that
rivals the Martian Valles Marineris. Several settlements
on Titania cater to tourists from the inner system and
the gas giants, who visit for rocketing, mekking, and
other sports in the canyon.

XIPHOS
One of two major strongholds of the ultimates, Xiphos
is a Hamilton cylinder orbiting in the Uranian ring
system. Though most of the tech underlying Hamilton
cylinders is open source, the station’s frighteningly
efficient weapon systems are not. Rumor has it the
ultimates traded some major favors to Gorgon De-
fense Systems in the process of building this station.
Where Aspis, the ultimates’ inner system habitat,
is a relatively open place, used by the Ultimates for
contact with potential mercenary clients, Xiphos is
off limits to anyone not of this faction. The rumored
population of ultimates here is only about 10,000, but
the ultimates purchase a large number of infomorph
indentures from Mars. Although there are no reports
of any of these indentures returning, rumor has it that
the ultimates download indentures serving in sensi-
tive areas into deaf, visually limited flats with no AR
implants and limited mental capacity.

NEPTUNE
Frigid, swept by 2,100 km/h winds, and tinged blue by
methane traces in its atmosphere, Neptune is the last
major planet in the system, orbiting at a distance of 30
AU from the sun. This far from the nearest star, plants
will not grow and solar power is useless. The only
sources of power are fusion, focused starlight, waste
heat, and chemical reactions. The hypercorp presence
in the Neptunian system is virtually absent, as the long
communication lags and extreme travel distances from
the rest of the solar system mean that few Neptunian
ventures garner profits. Similarly, the Titanian brand
of technosocialism has never found roots here. The
few transhumans who live out here are a resourceful
lot, and many colonists out here aren’t human at all.
Anarchists, brinkers, and desperados comprise most
of the population.

GLITCH
This habitat has the highest population density in the
system, with 20,000 infomorphs living in a meshed
cluster of twenty spherical structures that are 10
meters in diameter, powered by efficient central re-
actor systems. The habitat is attended by a cloud of
factories, harvesters, and defense satellites that occupy
considerably more space than the station itself. Various
rumors circulate that the inhabitants are researching
methods to improve infomorphs in the manner of seed
AIs, or that they are engaged in some vast forecasting
simulation effort.

ILMARINEN
Aligned with the argonauts, Ilmarinen is a hybrid
beehive/cluster dug into and partially protruding
from the large L4 asteroid Greymere. It is the largest
habitat in Neptune’s Trojans, with a population of

%%% txt/111.txt
7,000. Like many transhumans this far out in space,
most of Ilmarinen’s inhabitants are heavily modified
or inhabit exotic morphs. Vacuum and cold tolerant
morphs prevail, and many sections of the habitat are
unlivable for baseline transhumans.

MAHOGANY
The neo-avians who built this station threw away
the manual on habitat design and revisited the long-
out of favor toroidal configuration. The result is a
disc habitat—a plate half a kilometer along the edge
and one kilometer in diameter, resembling a slice
of an O’Neill cylinder with no windows. A fusion-
powered, low-heat, axial light source nourishes
the verdant hardwood forest below. Structures are
built into the disc walls up to 500 meters in height.
The disc, mostly woven from carbon fibers, rotates
quickly enough to generate 0.5 g at the habitat floor.
Mahogany has a population of 4,000 mercurials,
most of them neo-avians.

MINOR MOONS
Neptune’s other twelve moons are largely small
bodies, icy and sparsely (if at all) populated. Proteus
and Larissa, both sizable and relatively close to the
planet, host small populations. Naiad and Thalassa
are tiny but very close to the planet, and thus home to
some atmospheric skimming operations. Neso, orbit-
ing at about 1/3 AU from Neptune, has never been
visited—even by robotic probes.

NEPTUNIAN TROJANS
Trailing and preceding Neptune at the L4 and L5
points of its orbit are several hundred asteroids of
diverse, mostly icy composition. Neptune’s Trojans
are home to brinkers, hard-bitten prospectors, exotic
exhumans, and other extreme survivalists.

TRITON
Neptune’s largest moon has a tenuous atmosphere and
is chemically complex, composed of equal parts rock
and ices (frozen nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxyde).
It is also geologically active, with cryovolcanoes con-
tinually resurfacing the planet. The surface has few
inhabitants but several habitats orbit here, using the
moon’s abundant raw materials and low escape veloc-
ity to their advantage.

THE EDGE OF THE SYSTEM
Beyond Neptune lie only dwarf planets and icy aster-
oids waiting to become comets, roughly divided into
two regions: the Kuiper Belt, from 30 to 55 AU from
the Sun, and the Scattered Disk, which extends from
55 AU out to the Oort Cloud. Pluto, its binary object
Charon, and Eris have compositions similar to Triton.
A few small habitats orbit Pluto and Charon, eking
out a living by prospecting for volatiles. A number of
other dwarf planets orbit in the Kuiper belt and the
Disk, including Orcus, Senda, and 2000 OO67. Of
these, only Eris harbors a substantial population.
ERIS
Located at 55 AU from the sun at the edge of the
Scattered Disk, Eris is the largest dwarf planet in the
system and the site of a grim struggle between two of
transhumanity’s most militant factions: ultimates and
exhumans. The focal point of the struggle is Discord
Gate, the most remote of the system’s publicly-known
Pandora Gates, located in an icy labyrinth half a kilo-
meter beneath the surface of Eris.
   The brief history of the gate is bloody. Go-nin
Group troops violently wrested control of the gate
from the Ilmarinen anarchists who discovered it. Titan
and several anarchist and brinker groups both tried
to dislodge Go-nin, but these attempts failed, at great
cost in lives and ships. Go-nin’s control of the gate
seemed ensured until the hypercorp apparently tam-
pered too heavily with the gate’s black box controls.
A devastating explosion ensued, all but wiping out the
gate and Go-nin base. The gate, however, restructured
itself over the course of several days, though its loca-
tion has now shifted to the bottom of a melted crater.
   In the short period it took the Go-nin Group to hire
a group of ultimate mercenaries to retake the gate, a
hitherto unknown force of exhumans had seized the
area. The ultimates succeeded, but a group of exhumans
escaped through the gate. Go-nin now has nominal
control of the Discord Gate through the ultimates, who
maintain a heavily militarized base on Eris’s moon,
Dysnomia. However, in recent years the gate facility has
suffered several attacks by exhumans eager to infiltrate
the gate—and according to rumors, at least one of those
attacks originated from the gate itself.

MARKOV
The location of this habitat, a major stronghold of
the argonauts, is a closely guarded secret. Attempts to
search it out have revealed only decoys or lifeless rocks.
Though a great deal of information is available about
the habitat’s specs, operations, areas of research, and
informational resources, only highly placed members
of the argonauts may travel here. By all accounts, the
habitat is a windowless beehive, designed to be virtually
emissionless. Speculated locations include Pluto’s moon
Hydra, the deep Kuiper Belt, and even the Oort Cloud.

EXTRASOLAR SYSTEMS
Although travel between the stars is still outside the
realm of transhumanity’s achievements, the Pandora
Gates have allowed passage to myriad other star sys-
tems. A few are noted here, though many more exist—
not all of them explored.

ECHO
Echo is a binary system consisting of a bright orange
main sequence star and a pulsar (whence the system’s
name) about 12 light hours from one another. The
system has one immense, bright yellow Jovian world
(Echo VI) weighing in at 1.8 Jupiter masses and boast-
ing 101 known moons, two Neptune-like ice giants
further out, a thin mid-system asteroid belt, and several
Mercury-like inner planets.

%%% txt/113.txt
the Howling Plain, a windy plain of scrub brush and
bogs chosen for its rich hydrocarbon deposits and low
incidence of asteroid impacts. Banshee is an uneasy
blend of anarchist colonists and hypercorp interests.

MISHIPIZHEU
Mishipizheu is a red giant. The planet from which
the star takes its name, Mishipizheu I, is a Mars-sized
sphere of water with an atmosphere of nitrogen and
carbon dioxide and a rocky core. Mishipizheu I was
an almost Venus-sized sphere of ice 700 million years
ago, but the expansion of its star into the red giant
phase melted the planet. Initially quite warm and full
of pockets of ice and carbonaceous silts, the melting
planet was a crucible in which life could develop and
now hosts a complex ecosystem. Amoeboid boiler
reefs composed of gas sac creatures and their symbi-
otes bob on the surface or maintain neutral buoyancy
in the depths, becoming platforms for complex ecosys-
tems of largely animalian life.
   Mishipizheu I is orbited by a mid-size rocky moon,
Nanabozho, reachable via the Discord Gate. Nanabo-
zho is a mystery, as moons of this composition are
not normally found so far out in a system. The best
current theory is that Nanabozho was an inner system
object with an erratic orbit. It was perturbed out of
its orbit by one of the now-engulfed gas giants that
must once have existed, whence by chance it was
captured in Mishipizheu’s orbit. The extraordinarily
slim chances of such an event, however, have led to
wild speculation as to the actual origin of the moon,
which is as popular a destination for gatecrashers as
the planet below.

SYNERGY
Among the first attempts to establish a gatecrasher
colony beyond the original Pandora Gate, just 5 years
after the Fall, was a group of two hundred and fifty
colonists equipped with experimental headware com-
munications technology. Shortly after the jump, how-
ever, a still unidentified glitch forced the gate to close
and the mechanism could not be reset to the same set-
ting and coordinates for an entire five years. When the
gate technicians finally managed to reacquire the set-
tings recently and reopen the gate, the colonists were
found to have survived, but they had changed. The
technology sent with them was largely AI controlled,
enabling the creation of a hypermesh that linked the
thoughts, emotions, and sensory experiences of each
colonist with each other. After half a decade of dif-
ficult survival measures, this technology and the stress
of the situation linked the colonists and their AIs into
a group mind. Despite having the opportunity to
return to the solar system, these Synergists, as they
call themselves, have no desire to cut themselves off
from their shared consciousness.

OTHER EXOPLANETS
The number of extraterrestrial star systems that trans-
humanity has visited via the gates now numbers into
the hundreds, if not more—though only a small per-
centage of these have been notable and/or hospitable.
Only a few dozen have been substantially occupied
or colonized by transhumans, though this number is
growing rapidly. Among these, a few deserve mention:
   Arcadia: Accessed through the Martian Gate, the
Planetary Consortium is constructing an aerostat in
the upper atmosphere of this Venus-like planet which
will serve as a private resort for the hyperelite.
   Babylon: Initially thought to just be an unremark-
able scorched moon orbiting a planet very close to a
yellow star, researchers measuring the star made an
incredible accident discovery: what appears to be a
derelict spacecraft orbiting deep in the star’s corona.
Attempts to access this vessel have so far been thwart-
ed, but other projects are in the works, including the
possibility of towing the craft to safer climes.
   Bluewood: One of the first anarchist colonies es-
tablished through the Fissure Gate, this settlement
inhabits a beautiful, small Earth-like world with a
thriving eco-system. Established on the outskirts of
a large forest of eerie, alien, blue “trees,” the colony
was taken off-guard by the trees alarming growth
rate. The modular settlement buildings have all but
been surrounded and encased by overgrowth despite
modest efforts to keep them clear. Still intact but en-
gulfed by spiraling branchworks, the effect is beautiful
and haunting.
   Nótt: This barren ice-covered moon suffers from
heavy geothermal activity that causes its frozen crust to
constantly crack and refreeze. The unfortunate research
station staff here, all indentured, claim that something
out in the ice is stalking them—over a dozen have dis-
appeared in the last year. Pathfinder refuses to pull the
station back, however, and thorough searches from its
security teams have turned up nothing.
   Sky Ark: TerraGenesis is redesigning this dry, arid
moonlet as an offworld preserve for animal life,
including many formerly extinct Earth species resur-
rected from fossil DNA.
   Wormwood: This maze-like warren seems to be an
actual beehive habitat, though who tunneled it out
or why remains an unanswered mystery. The former
asteroid is part of the ring system of an unknown gas
giant. Clearly artificial, gatecrashers so far have found
no signs of technology or life.

MECHANICS
 In every game, there comes a time when the gamemas-
 ter must decide if a character succeeds or fails in an
 action. This is when the players roll dice and the char-
 acters’ stats and abilities come into play. This chapter
 defines the core mechanics and rules that govern the
 outcomes of events in Eclipse Phase.

 THE ULTIMATE RULE
 One rule in Eclipse Phase outweighs all of the others:
 have fun. This means that you should never let the
 rules get in the way of the game. If you don’t like a
 rule, change it. If you can’t find a rule, make one up.
 If you disagree over a rule’s interpretation, flip a coin.
 Try not to let rules interfere with the game’s flow and
 mood. If you’re in the middle of a really good scene
 or intense roleplaying and a rule suddenly comes into
 question, don’t stop the game to look it up and argue
 about it. Just wing it, make a decision quickly, and
 move on. You can always look the rule up later so
 you’ll remember it next time. If there are disagree-
 ments over a rule’s interpretation, remember that the
 gamemaster gets the final say.
    This rule also means that you shouldn’t let the story
 be guided solely by rolls of the dice. The element of
 chance that dice rolls provide lends a sense of random-
 ness, uncertainty, and surprise to the game. Sometimes
 this is exciting, like when a character makes an un-
 expectedly difficult roll and saves the day. At other
 times, it is brutal, such as when a lucky shot from an
 opponent takes one of the characters out for good in a
 fight. If the gamemaster wants a scenario to result in a
 pre-planned dramatic outcome and an unexpected die
 roll threatens that plan, they should feel free to ignore
 that roll and move the story in the direction they desire.

 DICE
 Eclipse Phase uses two ten-sided dice (each noted as
 a d10) for random rolls. In most cases, the rules will
 call for a percentile roll, noted as d100, meaning that

   you roll two ten-sided dice, choosing one to count first,
   and then read them as a result between 0 and 99 (with
   a roll of 00 counting as zero, not 100). The first die

   the ones digit. For example, you roll two ten-sided
   dice, one red and one black, calling out red first. The
   red one rolls a 1 and the black die rolls a 6, for a result
   of 16. Some sets of d10s, as shown above, are specifi-
   cally marked for easier rolling and reading.
      Occasionally the rules will call for individual die
   rolls, with each individual ten-sided die listed as a d10.
   If the rules call for several dice to be rolled, it will be
   noted as 2d10, 3d10, and so on. When multiple ten-
   sided dice are rolled in these instances, the results are
   added together. For example, a 3d10 roll of 4, 6, and
   7 counts as 17. On d10 rolls, a result of 0 is treated as
   a 10, not a zero.
      Most players of Eclipse Phase can get by with
   having two ten-sided dice, but it doesn’t hurt to
   have more on hand. These dice can be purchased
   at your friendly local game store or borrowed from
   another gamer.

MAKING TESTS
In Eclipse Phase, your character is bound to find
themself in adrenalin-pumping action scenes, high-
stress social situations, lethal combats, spine-tingling
investigations, and similar situations filled with drama,
risk, and adventure. When your character is embroiled
in these scenarios, you determine how well they do by
making tests—rolling dice to determine if they succeed
or fail, and to what degree.
  You make tests in Eclipse Phase by rolling d100 and
comparing the result to a target number. The target
number is typically determined by one of your char-
acter’s skills (discussed below) and ranges between 1
and 98. If you roll less than or equal to the target
number, you succeed. If you roll higher than the target
number, you fail.
   A roll of 00 is always considered a success. A roll of
99 is always a failure.


           Jaqui’s character needs to make a skill test. Her
 EXAMPLE




           skill is 55. Jaqui takes two ten-sided dice and
           rolls a 53—she succeeds! If she had rolled a 55,
           she still would have been successful, but any roll
           higher than that would have been a failure.


TARGET NUMBERS
As noted above, the target number for a d100 roll in
Eclipse Phase is usually the skill rating. Occasionally,
however, a different figure will be used. In some cases,
an aptitude score is used, which makes for much
harder tests as aptitude scores are usually well below
50 (see Aptitudes, p. 123). In other tests, the target
number will be an aptitude rating x 2 or x 3 or two
aptitudes added together. In these cases, the test de-
scription will note what rating(s) to use.

WHEN TO MAKE TESTS
The gamemaster decides when a character must make
a test. As a rule of thumb, tests are called for when-
ever there is a chance that a character might fail at an
action or when success or failure may have an effect
on the ongoing story. Tests are also called for when-
ever two or more characters act in opposition to one
another (for example, if they are arm wrestling or hag-
gling over a price). On the other hand, routine use of
a skill by someone with at least a rating of 30 in that
skill can be assumed to be successful with no test.
   It is not necessary to make tests for everyday, run-
of-the-mill activities, such as getting dressed or check-
ing your email (especially in Eclipse Phase, where so
many activities are automatically handled by the ma-
chines around you). Even an activity such as driving
a car does not call for dice rolls as long as you have
a small modicum of skill. A test might be necessary,
however, if you happen to be driving while bleeding
to death or are pursuing a gang of motorcycle-riding
scavengers through the ruins of a devastated city.
   Knowing when to call for tests and when to let the
roleplaying flow without interruption is a skill every
gamemaster must acquire. Sometimes it is better to
simply make a call without rolling dice in order to
maintain the pacing of the game. Likewise, in certain
circumstances the gamemaster may decide to make tests
for a character in secret, without the player noticing. If
an enemy is trying to sneak past a character on guard,
for example, the gamemaster will alert the player that
something is amiss if they ask them to make a perception
test. This means that the gamemaster should keep a copy
of each character’s record sheet on hand at all times.

DIFFICULTY AND MODIFIERS
The measure of a test’s diffi-
culty is reflected in its modifiers.
Modifiers are adjustments made
                                                    TEST DI
to the target number (not the           DIFFICULTY LEVEL
roll), either raising or lowering       Effortless
it. A test of average difficulty
                                        Simple
will have no modifiers, whereas
actions that are easier will have       Easy
positive modifiers (raising the         Average
target number, making success           Difficult
more likely) and harder ac-
                                        Challenging
tions will have negative modi-
fiers (lowering the target number,      Hard
making success less likely). It is
the gamemaster’s job to deter-
mine if a particular test is harder             MODIFIER
or easier than normal and to
                                        SEVERITY
what degree (as illustrated on the
Test Difficulty table) and to then      Minor
apply the appropriate modifier.         Moderate
   Other factors might also play a      Major
role in a test, applying additional
modifiers aside from the test’s
general level of difficulty. These factors include the en-
vironment, equipment (or lack thereof), and the health
of the character, among other things. The character
might be using superior tools, working in poor condi-
tions, or even wounded, and each of these factors must
be taken into account, applying additional modifiers
to the target number and adjusting the likelihood of
success or failure.
   For simplicity, modifiers are applied in multiples of
10 and come in three levels of severity: Minor (+/–10),
Moderate (+/–20), and Major (+/–30). Any number of
modifiers may be applied, as the gamemaster deems
appropriate, but the cumulative modifiers may not
exceed + or – 60.


  Jaqui is attempting to leap from one door to an-
  other across a large chamber in zero gravity. She’s
  in a hurry. If she misses the door, she’ll lose valu-
                                                            EXAMPLE




  able time, so the gamemaster calls for a Freefall
  Skill Test. Jaqui’s Freefall skill is 46. Unfortunately
  the chamber is filled with ﬂoating debris that could
  get in her way. The gamemaster determines this is
  a Moderate modifier, reducing the target number
  by 20. Jaqui must roll a 26 or less to succeed.

SIMPLIFYING
MODIFIERS
Rather than looking up and accumulating a
long list of modifiers for each action and doing
the math, the gamemaster can instead choose
to simply “eyeball” the situation and apply the
modifier that best sums up the net effect. This
method is quicker and allows for easier test
resolution. One way to eyeball the situation is
to simply apply the most severe modifier affect-
ing the situation.


           Tyska is trying to escape from some thing that’s
           chasing him through a derelict habitat. The
           gamemaster calls for a Freerunning Test, but
           there are a number of modifying conditions: it’s
 EXAMPLE




           dark, he’s running with a ﬂashlight, and there’s
           debris everywhere. Tyska, however, has an en-
           toptic map of the best route out of there to help
           him out. The gamemaster assesses the situation
           and decides the overall effect is that the test is
           challenging, and so a –20 modifier is applied.


NARRATIVE MODIFIERS
If you wish to develop a more cinematic feel for
your game, or if you simply wish to encourage
your players to invest more detail and creativ-
ity into the storyline, you can award “narrative
modifiers” to a character’s test when that player
describes what the character is doing in excep-
tionally colorful, inventive, or dramatic detail.
The better the detail, the better the modifier.


           Cole doesn’t just want his character to jump over
           the table, he wants to make an impact. Cole tells
           the gamemaster that his character kicks a chair
           out of the way, rolls over the dinner table on
 EXAMPLE




           his shoulder, grabs a fork as he does it, makes
           sure to knock all of the fine china on the ﬂoor,
           then lands on his feet in a defensive martial
           arts posture, fork raised high. The gamemaster
           decides the extra description is worth +10 to his
           Freerunning Test.




CRITICALS: ROLLING DOUBLES
Any time both dice come up with the same number—
00, 11, 22, 33, 44, etc.—you have scored a critical
success or critical failure, depending on whether your
roll also beat your target number. 00 is always a
critical success, whereas 99 is always a critical failure.
Rolling doubles means that a little something extra
happened with the outcome of the test, either positive
or negative. Criticals have a very specific application
in combat tests (see p. 192), but for all other purposes
the gamemaster decides what exactly went wrong or
right in a specific situation. Criticals can be used to
amplify a success or failure: you finish with a flour-
ish or fail so spectacularly that you remain the butt
of jokes for weeks to come. They can also result in
some sort of unexpected secondary effect: you repair
the device and improve its performance; or you fail
to shoot your enemy and hit an innocent bystander.
Alternately, a critical can be used to give a boost (or
a hindrance) to a follow-up action. For example, you
not only spot a clue, but you immediately suspect it
to be red herring; or you not only fail to strike the
target, but your weapon breaks, leaving you defense-
less. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive with
their use of criticals and choose results that create
comedy, drama, or tension.


  Audrey is attempting to intimidate a low-level
  triad mook into giving her information. Unfortu-
  nately she rolls a 99—a critical failure. Not only
  does she fail to scare the guy, but she accidentally
                                                          EXAMPLE




  lets slip an important piece of information that she
  didn’t want the triad to know. If she rolled a 00
  instead—a critical success—she would browbeat
  the man so thoroughly that he throws in some
  extra important information just so she’ll leave
  him alone in the future.


DEFAULTING: UNTRAINED SKILL USE
Certain tests may call for a character to use a skill they
don’t have—a process called defaulting. In this case,
the character instead uses the rating of the aptitude
(see p. 123) that is linked to the skill in question as the
target number.
   Not all skills may be defaulted; some of them are
so complex or require such training than an unskilled
character can’t hope to succeed. Skills that may not be
defaulted on are noted on the Skill List (p. 176) and in
the skill description.
   In rare cases, a gamemaster might allow a character
to default to another skill that also relates to a test
(see p. 173). When allowed, defaulting to another skill
incurs a –30 modifier.


  Toljek is trying to casually sneak inside a hyper-
  corp facility when he unexpectedly runs into a
  hypercorp employee. The woman he’s encountered
  doesn’t necessarily have grounds to be suspicious

  of Toljek’s presence, but the gamemaster calls for
  Toljek to make a Protocol Test to pass himself off as
  someone that belongs there. Unfortunately, Toljek
  doesn’t have that skill, so he must default to its
  linked aptitude, Savvy, instead. His Savvy score is
  only 18, so Toljek better hope he gets lucky.

TEAMWORK
If two or more characters join forces to tackle a test
together, one of the characters must be chosen as the
primary actor. This leading character will usually (but
not always) be the one with the highest applicable
skill. The primary acting character is the one who
rolls the test, though they receive a +10 modifier for
each additional character helping them out, up to a
maximum +30 modifier. Note that helping characters
do not necessarily need to know the skill being used
if the gamemaster decides that they can follow the
primary actor’s lead.


           The robotic leg on Eva’s synthetic morph has been
 EXAMPLE




           badly damaged, so she needs to repair it. Max and
           Vic both sit down and help her out, giving her a
           +20 modifier (+10 for each helper) to her Hard-
           ware: Robotics Test.




TYPES OF TESTS
  There are two types of tests in Eclipse Phase: Suc-
cess and Opposed.

SUCCESS TESTS
Success Tests are called for whenever a character is
acting without direct opposition. They are the stan-
dard tests used to determine how well a character
exercises a particular skill or ability.
   Success Tests are handled exactly as described under
Making Tests, p. 115. The player rolls d100 against a
target number equal to the character’s skill +/– modi-
fiers. If they roll equal to or less than the target number,
the test succeeds, and the action is completed as desired.
If they roll higher than the target number, the test fails.

TRYING AGAIN
If you fail at a test, you can take another shot. Each
subsequent attempt at an action after a failure, how-
ever, incurs a cumulative –10 modifier. That means the
second try suffers –10, the third –20, the fourth –30,
and so on, up to the maximum –60.

TAKING THE TIME
Most skill tests are made for Automatic, Quick, or
Complex Actions (see pp. 119–120) and so are re-
solved within one Action Turn (3 seconds, see p. 119).
Tests made for Task actions (p. 120) take longer.
  Players may choose to take extra time when their
character undertakes an action, meaning that they
choose to be especially careful when performing the
action in order to enhance their chance of success. For
every minute of extra time they take, they increase
their target number by +10. Once they’ve modified
their target number to over 99, they are practically as-
sured of success, so the gamemaster can waive the dice
roll and grant them an automatic success. Note that
the maximum +60 modifier rule still applies, so if their

%%% txt/120.txt
skill is under 40 to start with, taking the time may still
not guarantee a favorable outcome. You may take the
time even when defaulting (see Defaulting, p. 116).
   Taking extra time is a solid choice when time is not
a factor to the character, as it eliminates the chance
that a critical failure will be rolled and allows the
player to skip needless dice rolling. For certain tests it
may not be appropriate, however, if the gamemaster
decides that no amount of extra time will increase the
likelihood of success. In that case, the gamemaster
simply rules that taking the time has no effect.
   For Task action tests (p. 120), which already take
time to complete, the duration of the task must be
increased by 50 percent for each +10 modifier gained
for taking extra time.


           Srit is searching through an abandoned space-
           ship, looking for a sign of what happened to the
           missing crew. The gamemaster tells her it will take
 EXAMPLE




           twenty minutes to search the whole ship. She
           wants to be extra thorough, however, so she takes
           an extra thirty minutes. Fifty percent of the original
           timeframe is ten minutes, so taking an extra thirty
           minutes means that Srit receives a +30 modifier to
           her Investigation Test.


SIMPLE SUCCESS TESTS
In some circumstances, the gamemaster may not be
concerned that a character might fail a test, but instead
simply wants to gauge how well the character per-
forms. In this case, the gamemaster calls for a Simple
Success Test, which is handled just like a standard
Success Test (p. 117). Rather than determining suc-
cess or failure, however, the test is assumed to succeed.
The roll determines whether the character succeeds
strongly (rolls equal to or less than the target number)
or succeeds weakly (rolls above the target number).


           Dav is taking a short spacewalk between two
           parked ships. The gamemaster determines that this
           is a routine operation and calls for Dav to make a
           Simple Success Test using the Freefall skill. Dav’s
 EXAMPLE




           skill is only 35. He rolls a 76, but the gamemaster
           merely determines that Dav has some trouble
           orienting himself and has to take some extra time.
           If Dav had rolled a 77—a critical failure—his suit’s
           maneuvering jets may have died and he may have
           accidentally propelled himself into deep space.


MARGIN OF SUCCESS/FAILURE
Sometimes it may be important that a character not
only succeeds, but that they kick ass and take names
while doing it. This is usually true of situations where
the challenge is not only difficult but the action must
be pulled off with finesse. Tests of this sort may call
for a certain Margin of Success (MoS)—an amount by
which the character must roll under the target number.
For example, a character facing a target number of 55
and a MoS of 20 must roll equal to or less than a 35
to succeed at the level the situation calls for.


  An enemy has thrown an incendiary device near
  Stoya. She has only a moment to act and decides
  to try to kick it away from herself. Even better, she
  hopes to kick it into the open maintenance hatch
  a dozen meters away. The gamemaster determines
  that in order to kick it into the hatch, Stoya needs
  to succeed with an MoS of 30. Her Unarmed




                                                           EXAMPLE
  Combat skill is 66, so Stoya needs to roll 66 or
  less to kick the device away (though she may still
  be damaged when it explodes), and 36 or less to
  kick it into the hatch (in which case she will be
  completely safe when it detonates). She rolls a
  44—missing the hatch, but scoring a critical suc-
  cess! Her aim is off, but the gamemaster decides
  that the device rebounds off some machinery and
  falls into the hatch anyway.


  At other times, it may be important to know how
badly a character fails, as determined by a Margin
of Failure (MoF), which is the amount by which the
character rolled over the target number. In some cases,
a test may note that a character who fails with a
certain MoF may suffer additional consequences for
failing so dismally.


  Nico is trying to sketch out a picture of someone’s
  face. He has eidetic memory, but his drawing needs
  to be good enough for someone else to identify the
                                                           EXAMPLE




  person. He rolls against his Art: Drawing skill of 34,
  scoring a 97—a MoF of 63. The illustration is so
  bad that the gamemaster determines that anyone
  using that picture to identify the person will need
  to score a MoS of at least 63 on a Perception Test
  to recognize the person.


EXCELLENT SUCCESSES/SEVERE FAILURES
Excellent Successes and Severe Failures are a method
used to benchmark successes and failures with an
MoS or MoF of 30+. Excellent Successes are used in
situations where an especially good roll may boost the
intended effect, such as inflicting more damage with
a good hit in combat. Severe Failures denote a roll
that is particularly bad and has a worse effect than a
simple failure. Neither Excellent Successes or Severe
Failures are as good or bad as criticals, however.


  Stoya has been caught in a deal gone bad. She
  moves to kick her opponent using her Unarmed
  Combat of 65. She rolls a 33 (for an MoS of 32),

  and her opponent rolls a 21 (also successful, but
  less than Stoya, so she wins). She has succeeded
  and beaten her opponent with an MoS of 30+,
  scoring an Excellent Success, meaning she will
  inﬂict extra damage with the kick.

%%% txt/121.txt
OPPOSED TESTS
An Opposed Test is called for whenever a character’s
action may be directly opposed by another. Regardless
of who initiates the action, both characters must make
a test against each other, with the outcome favoring
the winner.
   To make an Opposed Test, each character rolls
d100 against a target number equal to the relevant
skill(s) along with any appropriate modifiers. If only
one of the characters succeeds (rolls equal to or less
than their target number), that character has won.
If both succeed, the character who gets the highest
dice roll wins. If both characters fail, or they both
succeed and roll the same number, then a deadlock
occurs—the characters remain pitted against each
other, neither gaining ground, until one of them takes
another action and either breaks away or makes an-
other Opposed Test.
   Note that critical successes trump high rolls in an
Opposed Test—if both characters succeed and one rolls
54 while the other rolls 44, the critical roll of 44 wins.
   Care must be taken when applying modifiers in an
Opposed Test. Some modifiers will affect both partici-
pants equally, and should be applied to both tests. If
a modifier arises from one character’s advantage in
relation to the other, however, that modifier should
only be applied to benefit the favored character; it
should not also be applied as a negative modifier to
the disadvantaged character.


           Zhou has been hired by the Jovian Republic to
           infiltrate his old pirate band. Even though he’s
           resleeved in a new skin, he’s worried that one of
           his old buddies, Wen, might recognize his manner-
           isms, since they lived, whored, and raided together
           for years. After Zhou has spent some time in Wen’s
           company, the gamemaster makes a secret Opposed
           Test, pitting Zhou’s Impersonation skill of 57 against
 EXAMPLE




           Wen’s Kinesics of 34. The gamemaster decides to
           give Wen a bonus +20, since he is so familiar with
           his former buddy and has been on the lookout for
           him, eager to repay the old grudge that split them
           apart. Wen’s target number is now 54.
              The gamemaster rolls for both. Zhou scores a 45
           and Wen a 39. Both succeed, but Zhou rolled higher,
           so his deception is successful. The gamemaster
           decides that Wen finds something about Zhou to
           be familiar, but he can’t put his finger on it.




OPPOSED TESTS AND MARGIN OF SUCCESS/FAILURE
In some cases, it may also be important to note a char-
acter’s Margin of Success or Failure in an Opposed
Test, as with a Success Test above. In this case, the
MoS/MoF is still determined by the difference between
the character’s roll and their target number—it is not
calculated by the difference between the character’s
roll and the opposing character’s roll.
VARIABLE OPPOSED TEST
In some cases, the rules will call for a Variable Op-
posed Test, which allows for slightly more outcomes
than a standard Opposed Test. If both characters
succeed in a Variable Opposed Test, then an outcome
is obtained which is different from just one character
winning over the other. The exact outcomes are noted
with each specific Variable Opposed Test.

  Test is called for, pitting Jaqui’s Infosec skill of 48
  against the AI’s Infosec of 25. Jaqui rolls a 48—a
  success—but the AI rolls a 14—also a success. In
  this circumstance, Jaqui succeeds in hacking in,
  but the AI is aware of the infiltration and can take
  active countermeasures against her.




TIME AND ACTIONS
  Though the gamemaster is responsible for manag-
ing the speed at which events unfold, there are times
when it is important to know exactly who is acting
when, especially if some people are acting before or
after other people. In these circumstances, gameplay
in Eclipse Phase is broken down into intervals called
Action Turns.

ACTION TURNS
Each Action Turn is three seconds long, meaning
there are twenty Action Turns per minute. The order
in which characters act during a turn is determined
by an Initiative Test (see Initiative, p. 121). Action
Turns are further subdivided into Action Phases. Each
character’s Speed stat (p. 121) determines the amount
of actions they can take in a turn, represented by how
many Action Phases they may take.

TYPES OF ACTIONS
The types of actions a character may take in an Action
Turn are broken down to: Automatic, Quick, Com-
plex, and Task actions.

AUTOMATIC ACTIONS
Automatic actions are “always on” and require no
effort from the character, assuming they are conscious.
   Examples: basic perception, certain psi sleights

QUICK ACTIONS
Quick actions are simple, so they can be done fast and
can be multi-tasked. The gamemaster determines how
many Quick actions a character may take in a turn.
  Examples: talking, switching a safety, activating an
implant, standing up

%%% txt/122.txt
COMPLEX ACTIONS
Complex actions require concent
effort. The number of Complex
character may take per turn is de
by their Speed stat (see p. 121).
  Examples: attacking, shooting, a
disarming a bomb, detailed examin

TASK ACTIONS
Task actions are any actions tha
longer than one Action Turn to
Each Task action has a timeframe
listed in the task description or o
determined by the gamemaster. T
frame determines how long the t
to complete, though this may be re

DEFINING YOUR CHARA
In order to gauge and quantify w
character is merely good at and w
excel in—or what they are cluele
and suck at—Eclipse Phase uses
of measurement factors: stats, sk
and morphs. Each of these chara
is recorded and tracked on your c
record sheet (p. 399).

CONCEPT
Your character concept defines wh
in the Eclipse Phase universe. You’r
a run-of-the-mill plebeian with a b
           mundane life, you’re a participant in a post-
on or      apocalyptic transhuman future who gets
ons a      caught up in intrigue, terrible danger, un-
mined      speakable horrors, and scrambling for sur-
           vival. Much like a character in an adventure,
batics,    drama, or horror story, you are a person
on         to whom interesting things happen—or if
           not, you make them happen. This means
           your character needs a distinct personality
 quire     and sense of identity. At the very least, you
 plete.    should be able to sum up your character
sually     concept in a single sentence, such as “cantan-
 rwise     kerous neotenic renegade archaeologist with
  time-    anger management issues” or “thrill-seeking
 takes     social animal who is dangerously obsessed
 ed by     with conspiracy theories and mysteries.” If
  MoS      it helps, you can always borrow ideas from
 argin     characters you’ve seen in movies or books,
racter     modifying them to fit your tastes.
 work         Your character’s concept will likely be
ual to     influenced by two important factors: back-
 0 full    ground and faction. Your background de-
ailure.    notes the circumstances under which your
 f one     character was raised, while your faction
harac-     indicates the post-Fall grouping to which
   char-   you most recently held ties and allegiances.
y may      Both of these play a role in character cre-
acters     ation (p. 128).
  inter-
e and      MOTIVATIONS
ss the     The clash of ideologies and memes is a core
quires     component of Eclipse Phase, and so every
on.        character has three motivations—personal
  7), a    memes that dominate the character’s interests
 ction,    and pursuits. These memes may be as ab-
 to de-    stract as ideologies the character adheres to
  must     or supports—for example, social anarchism,
e they     Islamic jihad, or bioconservatism—or they
   wish    may be as concrete as specific outcomes the
a –10      character desires, such as revealing a certain
reduc-     hypercorp’s corruption, obtaining massive
odifier    personal wealth, or winning victories for
           uplifted rights. A motivation may also be
           framed in opposition to something; for ex-
           ample, anti-capitalism or anti-pod-citizenship,
TER        or staying out of jail. In essence, these are
           ideas that motivate the character to do the
  your
t they     things they do. Motivation is best noted as a
about      term or short phrase on the character sheet,
umber      marked with a + (in favor of) or – (opposed
 traits,   to). Players are encouraged to develop their
 istics    own distinct motivations for their characters,
 cter’s    in cooperation with the gamemaster. Some
           examples are provided on p. 138.
              In game terms, motivation is used to help
           define the character’s personality and influ-
           ence their actions for roleplaying purposes.

%%% txt/123.txt
   Motivational goals may be short-term or long-term,
and may in fact change for a character over time.
Short-term goals are more immediately obtainable
objectives or short-lived interests, and these goals are
likely to change once achieved. Even so, they should
reflect intentions that will take more than one game
session to reach, possibly covering weeks or months.
These short-term goals may in fact tie directly into the
gamemaster’s current storyline. Examples include con-
ducting a full analysis of an alien artifact, completing
a research project, or living life as an uplifted dog for a
while. Long-term goals reflect deeply rooted beliefs or
tasks that require major efforts and time (possibly life-
long) to achieve. For example, finding the lost backup
of a sibling missing since the Fall, overthrowing an
autocratic regime, or making first contact with a new
alien species. For purposes of awarding Moxie or Rez
Points, long-term goals are best broken down into
obtainable chunks. Someone whose goal is to track
down the murderer who killed their parents when they
were a child, for example, can be considered to achieve
that goal every time they discover some evidence that
brings them a little closer to solving the puzzle.

EGO VS. MORPH
Eclipse Phase’s setting dictates that a distinction must
be made between a character’s ego (their ingrained
self, their personality, and inherent traits that perpetu-
ate in continuity) and their morph (their ephemeral
physical—and sometimes virtual—form). A charac-
ter’s morph may die while the character’s ego lives on
(assuming appropriate backup measures have been
taken), transplanted into a new morph. Morphs are
expendable, but your character’s ego represents the
ongoing, continuous life path of your character’s mind,
personality, memories, knowledge, and so forth. This
continuity may be interrupted by an unexpected death
(depending on how recent the backup was made), or
by forking (see p. 273), but it represents the totality of
the character’s mental state and experiences.
   Some aspects of your character—particularly skills,
along with some stats and traits—belong to your char-
acter’s ego, which means they stay with them through-
out the character’s development. Some stats and traits,
however, are determined by morph, as noted, and so
will change if your character leaves one body and
takes on another. Morphs may also affect other skills
and stats, as detailed in the morph description.
   It is important that you keep ego- and morph-de-
rived characteristics straight, especially when updating
your character’s record sheet.

CHARACTER STATS
Your character’s stats measure several characteristics
that are important to game play: Initiative, Speed,
Durability, Wound Threshold, Lucidity, Trauma
Threshold, and Moxie. Some of these stats are inher-
ent to your character’s ego, others are influenced or
determined by morph.
EGO STATS
Initiative
Lucidity
Trauma Threshold
Insanity Rating
Moxie

MORPH STATS
Speed
Durability
Wound Threshold
Death Rating
Damage Bonus

INITIATIVE (INIT)
Your character’s Initiative stat helps determine when
they act in relation to other characters during the
Action Turn (see Initiative, p. 188). Your Initiative stat
is equal to your character’s Intuition + Reflexes apti-
tudes (see Aptitudes, p. 123) multiplied by 2. Certain
implants and other factors may modify this score.
                                                       EXAMPLE




  Lazaro’s Intuition is 15 and his Reﬂexes score is
  20. That means his Initiative is 70 (15 + 20 = 35,
  35 x 2 = 70).


SPEED (SPD)
The Speed stat determines how often your character
gets to act in an Action Turn (see Initiative, p. 188).
All characters start with a Speed stat of 1, meaning
they act once per turn. Certain implants and other
advantages may boost this up to a maximum of 4.

DURABILITY (DUR)
Durability is your morph’s physical health (or struc-
tural integrity in the case of synthetic shells, or system
integrity in the case of infomorphs). It determines the
amount of damage your morph can take before you are
incapacitated or killed (see Physical Health, p. 206).
   Durability is unlimited, though the range for base-
line (unmodified) humans tends to fall between 20 and
60. Your Durability stat is determined by your morph.

WOUND THRESHOLD (WT)
A Wound Threshold is used to determine if you receive a
wound each time you take physical damage (see Physi-
cal Health, p. 206). The higher the Wound Threshold,
the more resistant to serious injury you are.
   Wound Threshold is calculated by dividing Durabil-
ity by 5 (rounding up).

DEATH RATING (DR)
Death Rating is the total amount of damage your
morph can take before it is killed or destroyed
beyond repair. Death Rating is equal to DUR x 1.5 for
biomorphs and DUR x 2 for synthmorphs.

%%% txt/124.txt
           Tyska is sleeved in a run-of-the-mill splicer morph
           with a Durability of 30. That gives him a Wound
 EXAMPLE




           Threshold of 6 (30 ÷ 5) and a Death Rating of
           45 (30 x 1.5). If Tyska acquired an implant that
           boosted his Durability by +10 to 40, his Wound
           Threshold would be 8 (40 ÷ 5) and his Death
           Rating would be 60 (40 x 1.5).


LUCIDITY (LUC)
Lucidity is similar to Durability, except that it measures
mental health and state of mind rather than physical
well-being. Your Lucidity determines how much stress
(mental damage) you can take before you are incapaci-
tated or driven insane (see Mental Health, p. 209).
  Lucidity is unlimited, but generally ranges from
20 to 60 for baseline unmodified humans. Lucidity is
determined by your Willpower aptitude x 2.

TRAUMA THRESHOLD (TT)
The Trauma Threshold determines if you suffer a
trauma (mental wound) each time you take stress (see
Mental Health, p. 209). A higher Trauma Threshold
means that your mental state is more resilient against
experiences that might inflict psychiatric disorders or
other serious mental instabilities.
  Trauma Threshold is calculated by dividing Lucidity
by 5 (rounding up).

INSANITY RATING (IR)
Your Insanity Rating is the total amount of stress your
mind can take before you go permanently insane and
are lost for good. Insanity Rating equals LUC x 2.
 EXAMPLE




           Cole’s Willpower is 16. That makes his Lucidity
           stat 32 (16 x 2), his Trauma Threshold 7 (32 ÷ 5,
           rounded up), and his Insanity Rating 64 (32 x 2)


MOXIE
Moxie represents your character’s inherent talent at
facing down challenges and overcoming obstacles
with spirited fervor. More than just luck, Moxie is
your character’s ability to run the edge and do what
it takes, no matter the odds. Some people consider it
the evolutionary trait that spurred humankind to pick
up tools, expand our brains, and face the future head
on, leaving other mammals in the dust. When the sky
is falling, death is imminent, and no one can help you,
Moxie is what saves the day.
   The Moxie stat is rated between 1 and 10, as pur-
chased during character creation (and perhaps raised
later). In game play, Moxie is used to influence the
odds in your favor. Every game session, your character
begins with a number of Moxie points equal to their
Moxie stat. Moxie points may be spent for any of the
following effects:
 • The character may ignore all modifiers that apply
   to a test. The Moxie point must be spent before
   dice are rolled.
 • The character may flip-flop a d100 roll result. For
   example, an 83 would become a 38.
 • The character may upgrade a success, making it a
   critical success, as if they rolled doubles. The char-
   acter must succeed in the test before they spend
   the Moxie point.
 • The character may ignore a critical failure, treat-
   ing it as a regular failure instead.
 • The character may go first in an Action Phase (p. 189).

  Only 1 point of Moxie may be spent on a single roll.
Moxie points will fluctuate during gameplay, as they
are spent and sometimes regained.
   Regaining Moxie: At the gamemaster’s discretion,
Moxie points may be refreshed up to the character’s
full Moxie stat any time the character rests for a sig-
nificant period. Moxie points may also be regained if
the character achieves a personal goal, as determined
by their Motivation (see p. 121). The gamemaster de-
termines how much Moxie is regained in proportion
to the goal achieved.


  Audrey has a difficult Piloting: Aircraft roll to make.
  Her skill is 61, but she’s facing a lot of modifiers
  (–30), and if she fails she’s in big trouble. She
                                                           EXAMPLE




  could spend a point of Moxie before the test to
  ignore the modifiers, but she decides to take her
  chances against the target number of 31. Unfor-
  tunately, she rolls an 82. Luckily, she can spend
  a Moxie point to ﬂip-ﬂop that roll and make it a
  28—a success!


DAMAGE BONUS
  The Damage Bonus stat quantifies how much extra
oomph your character is able to give their melee and
thrown weapons attacks. Damage Bonus is deter-
mined by dividing your Somatics aptitude (see below)
by 10 and rounding down.

CHARACTER SKILLS
Skills represent your character’s talents. Skills are
broken down into aptitudes (ingrained abilities that
everyone has) and learned skills (abilities and knowl-
edge picked up over time). Skills determine the target
number used for tests (see Making Tests, p. 115).

APTITUDES
Aptitudes are the core skills that every character has
by default. They are the foundation on which learned
skills are built. Aptitudes are purchased during charac-
ter creation and rate between 1 and 30, with 10 being
average for a baseline unmodified human. They repre-
sent the ingrained characteristics and talents that your
character has developed from birth and stick with you
even when you change morphs—though some morphs
may modify your aptitude ratings.

%%% txt/125.txt
  Each learned skill is linked to an aptitude. If a
character doesn’t have the skill necessary for a test,
they may default to the aptitude instead (see Default-
ing, p. 116).
  There are 7 aptitudes in Eclipse Phase:

 • Cognition (COG) is your aptitude for problem-
   solving, logical analysis, and understanding. It
   also includes memory and recall.
 • Coordination (COO) is your skill at integrat-
   ing the actions of different parts of your morph
   to produce smooth, successful movements. It
   includes manual dexterity, fine motor control,
   nimbleness, and balance.
 • Intuition (INT) is your skill at following your
   gut instincts and evaluating on the fly. It includes
   physical awareness, cleverness, and cunning.
 • Reflexes (REF) is your skill at acting quickly. This
   encompasses your reaction time, your gut-level
   response, and your ability to think fast.
 • Savvy (SAV) is your mental adaptability, social in-
   tuition, and proficiency for interacting with others.
   It includes social awareness and manipulation.
 • Somatics (SOM) is your skill at pushing your
   morph to the best of its physical ability, includ-
   ing the fundamental utilization of the morph’s
   strength, endurance, and sustained positioning
   and motion.
 • Willpower (WIL) is your skill for self-control,
   your ability to command your own destiny.

LEARNED SKILLS
Learned skills encompass a wide range of specialties
and education, from combat training to negotiating
to astrophysics (for a complete skill list, see p. 176).
Learned skills range in rating from 1 to 99, with an
average proficiency being 50. Each learned skill is
linked to an aptitude, which represents the underlying
competency in which the skill is based. When a learned
skill is purchased (either during character generation
or advancement), it is bought starting at the rating of
the linked aptitude and then raised from there. If the
linked aptitude is raised or modified, all skills built off
it are modified appropriately as well.
   Depending on your background and faction, you
may receive some starting skills for free during
character creation. Like aptitudes, learned skills stay
with the character even when they change morphs,
though certain morphs, implants, and other factors
may sometimes modify your skill rating. If you lack
a particular skill called for by a test, in most cases
you can default to the linked aptitude for the test (see
Defaulting, p. 116).

SPECIALIZATIONS
Specializations represent an area of concentration and
focus in a particular learned skill. A character who
learns a specialization is one who not only grasps the
basic tenets of that skill, but they have trained hard
to excel in one particular aspect of that skill’s field.
Specializations apply a +10 modifier when the charac-
ter utilizes that skill in the area of specialization.
   Specializations may be purchased during character
creation or advancement for any existing skill the
character possesses with a rating of 30 or more. Only
one specialization may be purchased for each skill.
Specific possible specializations are noted under indi-
vidual the skill descriptions (see Skills, p. 170).


       Toljek has Palming skill of 63 with a specializa-




                                                           EXAMPLE
  tion in Pickpocketing. Whenever he uses Palming
  to pick someone’s pocket or otherwise steal from
  someone’s person, his target number is 73, but for
  all other uses of Palming the standard 63 applies.


CHARACTER TRAITS
Traits include a range of inherent qualities and fea-
tures that help define your character. Some traits are
positive, in that they give your character a bonus to
certain stats, skills, or tests, or otherwise give them
an edge in certain situations. Others are negative, in
that they impair your abilities or occasionally create
a glitch in your plans. Some traits apply to a charac-
ter’s ego, staying with them from body to body, while
others only apply to a character’s morph.
  Traits are purchased during character generation.
Positive traits cost customization points (CP), while
negative traits give you extra CP to spend on other
things (see Traits, p. 145). The maximum number of
CP you may spend on traits is 50, while the maxi-
mum you may gain from negative traits is 50. In rare
circumstances—and only with gamemaster approv-
al—traits may be purchased, bought off, or inflicted
during gameplay (see p. 153).

CHARACTER MORPH
In Eclipse Phase, your body is disposable. If your body
gets old, sick, or too heavily damaged, you can digitize
your consciousness and download it into a new body.
The process isn’t cheap or easy, but it offers effective
immortality—as long as you remember to back your-
self up and don’t go insane. The term morph is used to
describe any type of form your mind inhabits, whether
it be a vat-grown clone sleeve, a synthetic robotic shell,
a part-bio/part-flesh pod, or even the purely electronic
software state of an infomorph.
   You purchase your starting morph during character
creation (see p. 128). This is likely the morph you
were born with (assuming you were born), though it
may simply be another morph you’ve moved onto.
   Physical looks aside, your morph has a large impact
on your characteristics. Your morph determines certain
physical stats, such as Durability and Wound Threshold,
and it may also influence Initiative and Speed. Morphs
may also modify some of your aptitudes and learned
skills. Some morphs come pre-loaded with specific traits
and implants, representing how it was crafted, and you
can always bling yourself out with more implants if
you choose (see Implants, p. 126). All of these factors

%%% txt/126.txt
are noted in the individual morph descriptions (see
p. 139).
   If you plan on switching your current morph to
another during gameplay, you may first want to back
yourself up (see Backups and Uploads, p. 268). Back-
ing up regularly is always a smart option in case you
suffer an accidental or untimely death. Acquiring a
new morph is not always easy, especially if you want
it pre-loaded according to certain specifications. The
full process is detailed under Resleeving, p. 271.

Aptitude Maximums
Every morph has an aptitude maximum, sometimes
modified by traits. This maximum represents the high-
est value at which the character may use that aptitude
while inhabiting that morph, reflecting an inherent
limitation in some morphs. If a character’s aptitude
exceeds the aptitude maximum of their morph, they
must use it at the maximum value for the duration
of the time they remain in that morph. This may also
affect the skills linked to that aptitude, which must be
modified appropriately.
   Some implants, gear, psi, and other factors may
modify a character’s natural aptitudes. These aug-
mented values may exceed a morph’s aptitude maxi-
mums, as they represent external factors boosting the
morph’s ability. No aptitude, however, augmented or
not, may ever exceed a value of 40. Innate ability only
takes a person so far—after that point, actual skill is
what counts.


  Eva has a Cognition aptitude of 25. She is unfor-
  tunately forced to sleeve into a flat morph with an
                                                        EXAMPLE




  aptitude maximum of 20. For the duration of the
  period she inhabits that morph, her Cognition is
  reduced to 20, which also impacts all of her COG-
  linked skills, reducing them by 5.
Things Characters Use
In the advanced technological setting of Eclipse Phase,
characters don’t get by on their wits and morphs
alone; they take advantage of their credit and reputa-
tion to acquire gear and implants and use their social
networks to gather information. Some characters also
have the capability to use mental powers known as psi.

Identity
In an age of ubiquitous computing and omnipresent
surveillance, privacy is a thing of the past—who you
are and what you do is easily accessed online. Char-
acters in Eclipse Phase, however, are often involved
in secretive or less-than-legal activities, so the way to
keep the bloggers, news, paparazzi, and law off your
back is to make extensive use of fake IDs. While Fire-
wall often provides covers for its sentinel agents, it
doesn’t hurt to keep a few extra personas in reserve, in
case matters ever go out the airlock in a hurry. Thank-
fully, the patchwork allegiances of city-state habitats
and faction stations means that identities aren’t too
difficult to fake, and the ability to switch morphs
makes it even easier. On the other hand, anyone with a
copy of your biometrics or geneprint is going to have
an edge tracking you down or finding any forensic
traces you leave behind (for more on ID, see p. 279).

Social Networks
Social networks represent people the character knows
and social groups with which they interact. These
contacts, friends, and acquaintances are not just main-
tained in person, but also through heavy Mesh contact.
Social software allows people to stay updated on what
the people they know are doing, where they are, and
what they are interested in, right up to the minute.
Social networks also incorporate the online projects

%%% txt/127.txt
of individual members, whether it’s a mesh-site loaded
with a band member’s songs, a personal archive of
stored media, a decade of blog entries reviewing the
best places to score cheap electronics, or a depository
of research papers and studies someone has worked
on or finds interesting.
  In game play, social networks are quite useful
to characters. Their friends list is an essential
resource—a pool of people you can actively poll for
ideas, troll for news, listen to for the latest rumors,
buy or sell gear from, hit up for expert advice, and
even ask for favors.
  While a character’s social networks are nebulous
and constantly shifting, the use of them is not. A
character takes advantage of their social networks via
the Networking (Field) skill (p. 182). The exact use
of this skill is covered under Reputation and Social
Networks, p. 285.

CRED
The Fall devastated the global economies and cur-
rencies of the past. In the years of reconsolidation
that followed, the hypercorps and governments
inaugurated a new system-wide electronic monetary
system. Called credit, this currency is backed by all
of the large capitalist-oriented factions and is used to
trade for goods and services as well for other financial
transactions. Credit is mainly transferred electroni-
cally, though certified credit chips are also common
(and favored for their anonymity). Hardcopy bills are
even used in some habitats.
   Depending on your background or faction, your
character may be given an amount of credit at the
start of the game. During game play, your character
must earn credit the old-fashioned way: by earning
or stealing it.

REP
Capitalism is no longer the only economy in town.
The development of nanofabricators allowed for the
existence of post-scarcity economies, a fact eagerly
taken advantage of by anarchist factions and others.
When anyone can make anything, concepts like
property and wealth become irrelevant. The advent
of functional gift and communist economies, among
other alternative economic models, means that in
such systems you can acquire any goods or services
you need via free exchange, reciprocity, or barter—
presuming you are a contributing member of such
a system and respected by your peers. Likewise, art,
creativity, innovation, and various forms of cultural
expression have a much higher worth than they do in
capitalist economies.
   In alternative economies, money is often meaning-
less, but reputation matters. Your reputation score
represents your social capital—how esteemed you
are to your peers. Rep can be increased by positively
influencing, contributing to, or helping individuals or
groups, and it can be decreased through antisocial
behavior. In anarchist habitats, your likelihood of
obtaining things that you need is entirely based on
how you are viewed by others.
   Reputation is easily measured by one of several
online social networks. Your actions are rewarded
or punished by those with whom you interact, who
can ping your Rep score with positive or negative
feedback. These networks are used by all of the fac-
tions, as reputation can affect your social activities in
capitalist economies as well. The primary reputation
networks include:

 • The @-list: the Circle-A list for anarchists, Bar-
   soomians, Extropians, scum, and Titanians, noted
   as @-rep.
 • CivicNet: used by the Jovian Republic, Lunar-
   Lagrange Alliance, Morningstar Constellation,
   Planetary Consortium, and many hypercorps,
   referred to as c-rep.
 • EcoWave: used by nano-ecologists, preservation-
   ists, and reclaimers, referred to as e-rep.
 • Fame: the seen-and-be-seen network used by
   socialites, artists, glitterati, and media, referred
   to as f-rep.
 • Guanxi: used by the triads and numerous crimi-
   nal entities, referred to as g-rep.
 • The Eye: used by Firewall, noted as i-rep.
 • RNA: Research Network Affiliation, used by ar-
   gonauts, technologists, scientists, and researchers,
   referred to as r-rep.

  Reputation is rated from 0-99. Depending on your
background and faction, you may start with a Rep
score in one or more networks. This can be bolstered
through spending customization points during charac-
ter creation. During game play, your Rep scores will
depend entirely on your character’s actions. For more
information, see Reputation and Social Networks, p.
285.
  Note that each Rep score is tied to a particular
identity.

GEAR
Gear is all of the equipment your character owns
and keeps on their person, from weapons and armor
to clothing and electronics. You buy gear for your
character with customization points during character
creation (see p. 136) and in the game with Credit or
Rep. Certain restricted, illegal, or hard-to-find items
may require special efforts to obtain (see Acquiring
Gear, p. 298). If you have access to a nanofabricator,
you may be able to simply build gear, presuming you
have the proper blueprints (see Nanofabrication, p.
284). For a complete listing of equipment options, see
the Gear chapter, p. 296.
   Even among the remaining capitalist economies,
prices can vary drastically. To represent this, all
gear falls into a cost category. Each category defines
a range of costs, so the gamemaster can adjust the
prices of individual items as appropriate to the situa-
tion. Each category also lists an average price for that

%%% txt/128.txt
category, which is used during character generation
and any time the gamemaster wants to keep costs
simple. See the Gear Costs table on p. 137.

IMPLANTS
Implants include cybernetic, bionic, genetech, and
nanoware enhancements to your character’s morph
(or mechanical enhancements in the case of a synthetic
shell). These implants may give your character special
abilities or modify their stats, skills, or traits. Some
morphs come pre-equipped with implants, as noted in
their descriptions (see p. 139). You may also special-
order morphs with specific implants (see Morph Ac-
quisition, p. 277). If you want to upgrade a morph
you are already in, you can undergo surgery or other
treatments to have an enhancement installed (see
Healing Vats, p. 326. For a complete list of available
implant/enhancement options, see pp. 300-311, Gear.

PSI
Psi is a rare and anomalous set of mental abilities that
are acquired due to infection by a strange nanovirus
released during the Fall. Psi abilities are not completely
understood, but they give characters certain advan-
tages—as well as some disadvantages. A character
requires the Psi trait (p. 147) to use psi abilities, which
are called sleights. Psi users are called asyncs. A full
explanation of psi and details on the various sleights
can be found in the Mind Hacks chapter, p. 216.

RACTER CREATION AND ADVANCEMEN



CTER CREATION AN
 The first step towards playing Eclipse Phase is to
 define your character. If you’re new to the game and
 setting, the easiest way to jump right in is to simply
 select one of the Sample Characters provided on pp.
 154–169. If you’re more familiar with RPGs, or you
 simply want finer control over your character, you
 can build them from scratch, perhaps using one of the
 Sample Characters as a template. This chapter will
 walk you through the process of character genera-
 tion, from the general concept and personality to the
 crunchy game statistics.



 CHARACTER GENERATION
 There are two parts to every player character. The
 first is the sets of numbers and attributes that define
 what a character is good or bad at (or even what they
 can and can’t do) according to the game mechanics.
 These are more than just statistics, however—these
 characteristics help to define your character’s abili-
 ties and interests, and by extension their background,
 education, training, and experience. During the
 character creation process, you will have the ability
 to assign, adjust, and juggle these characteristics as
 you like. If you have a pre-conceived notion of what
 the character is about, you can optimize the stats to
 reflect that. Alternatively, you can tweak the stats until
 you get something you like, then base the character’s
 backstory off of what you develop.
    The second part to every player character is their
 personality. What defines them as a person? What
 makes them tick? What pisses them off? What sparks
 their interest? What positive aspects of their person-
 ality make them appealing as a friend, comrade, or
 lover—or at least someone interesting to play? What
 character flaws and quirks do they have? These ques-
 tions matter because they will also guide you as you
 assign stats, skills, and traits.
    Character generation is a step-by-step process.
 Unlike some games, the process for creating an Eclipse
 Phase character is not random—you have complete
 control over every aspect of your character’s design.
 Some stages must be completed before you can move
 on to others. The complete process is broken down
 on the Step-By-Step Guide to Character Creation
 sidebar.

 CHARACTER CONCEPT
 Deciding what/who you want to play before you make
 the character is usually the best route. Pick a simple
 archetype that fits your character, and work from there.
 Do you want to play an explorer? Someone sneaky,
 like a spy or thief? Someone cerebral, like a scientist?
 A hardened criminal or ex-cop? Or do you prefer to
 be a rabble-rousing agitator? You can also start with a

 personality type and choose an associated profession. If
 you want a social butterfly who excels at manipulating
 people, you can play a media personality, blogger, or
 party-going socialite. Perhaps you’d prefer a bottomed-
 out reject with substance abuse problems, in which
 case an ex-merc or former hypercapitalist who lost
 his fortune and family during the Fall might fit. How
 about an energetic, live-life-to-the-fullest, must-see-it-
 all character? Then a habitat freerunner or professional
 gatecrasher might be what you’re looking for.
    Make sure to check in with the other players and
 try to create a character that’s complementary to the
 rest of the team—preferably one who provides some
 skill-set the group lacks. Why create a research arche-
 ologist if someone else is already set on playing one,
 especially when the team lacks a good combat special-
 ist or async? On the other hand, if your team is going
 to be running an alien archeological expedition, then
 having more than one researcher (each with distinct
 areas of expertise) might not be bad.
    Once you have the basic concept, try to fill it with
 a few more details, making it into a one-sentence

summary. If you started with the concept of “xeno-so-
ciologist,” expand it to “open-minded amateur linguist
and expert xeno-sociologist who is fascinated by alien
cultures, collects Factor kitsch, has a high-tolerance
for ‘yuck factors,’ and whose best friends tend to be
uplifts and AIs.” This will give you a few more details
around which you can focus the character’s strengths
and weaknesses.

CHOOSE BACKGROUND
The first step to creating your character is to choose a
background. Was your character born on Earth before
the Fall? Were they raised on a habitat commune? Or
did they start existence as a disembodied AI?
  You must choose one of the backgrounds for your
character from the list below. Choose wisely, as each
background may provide your character with certain
skills, traits, limitations, or other characteristics to
start with. Keep in mind that your background is
where you came from, not who you are now. It is
the past, whereas your faction represents whom your
character is currently aligned with. Your future, of
course, is yours to make.
  The background options presented below cover a
wide selection of transhumanity, but they cannot cover
every possibility. If your gamemaster allows it, you
may work with them to develop a background that is
not included on this list, using these as guidelines to
keep it balanced.

DRIFTER
You were raised with a social grouping that remained
on the move throughout the Sol system. This could
have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers, scav-
engers, or just migrant workers. You are used to roam-
ing space travel between habitats and stations.
Advantages: +10 Navigation skill, +20 Pilot: Spacecraft
  skill, +10 Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All, especially Bouncers and
  Hibernoids

FALL EVACUEE
You were born and raised on Earth and evacuated
during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life
(and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones)
behind you. You were lucky enough to survive with
your body intact and continue to make a life for your-
self out in the system.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 Net-
  working: [Field] skill of your choice, +1 Moxie
Disadvantages: Only 2,500 Starting Credit (can still
  buy credit with CP)
Common Morphs: Flats, Splicers

HYPERELITE
You are privileged to have been raised as part of the
immortal upper class that rules many inner system
habitats and hypercorps. You were pampered with
wealth and influence that most people can only
dream of.
Advantages: +10 Protocol skill, +10,000 Credit, +20
  Networking: Hypercorps skill
Disadvantages: May not start with flat, splicer, or any
  pod, uplift, or synthetic morphs
Common Morphs: Exalts, Sylphs

INFOLIFE
You entered existence as a digital consciousness—
an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Your very
existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of
those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs).
Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your
capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you
do have full autonomy.
Advantages: +30 Interfacing skill, Computer skills (In-
  fosec, Interfacing, Programming, Research) bought
  with Customization Points are half price
Disadvantages: Real World Naiveté trait, Social Stigma
  (AGI) trait, may not purchase Psi trait, Social skills
  bought with Customization Points are double price
Common Morphs: Infomorphs, synthetic morphs

ISOLATE
You were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on
the fringes of the system. Whether raised as part of
a religious group, cult, social experiment, anti-tech
cell, or a group that just wanted to be isolated, you
spent most if not all of your upbringing isolated
from other factions.
Advantages: +20 to two skills of your choice
Disadvantages: –10 starting Rep
Common Morphs: All

LOST
You are a legacy of one of the most infamous debacles
since the Fall. As a member of the “Lost generation,”
you went through an accelerated-growth childhood,
somehow surviving where others of your kind died,
went insane, or were persecuted (see The Lost, p. 233).
Your background is a social stigma, but it does provide
you with certain advantages ... and burdens.
Advantages: +20 to two Knowledge skills of your
   choice, Psi trait
Disadvantages: Mental Disorder (choose two) trait,
   Social Stigma (Lost) trait, must start with Futura
   morph
Common Morphs: Futuras

LUNAR COLONIST
You experienced your childhood in one of the cramped
dome cities or underground stations on Luna, Earth’s
moon. You had a ringside seat to the Fall of Earth.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 to one
  Technical, Academic: [Field], or Profession: [Field] skill
  of your choice, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: Flats, Splicers

%%% txt/134.txt
MARTIAN
  You were raised in one of the stations on or above
Mars, now the most populated planet in the system.
Your home town may or may not have survived the
Fall.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 to one
  Technical, Academic: [Field], or Profession: [Field]
  skill of your choice, +20 Networking: Hypercorps
  skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: Flats, Splicers, and Rusters

ORIGINAL SPACE COLONIST
You, or your parents, were part of the first “gen-
erations” of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to
stake a claim in space, so you are familiar with the
cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older
stations and habitats. As a “zero-one G” (zero-gravity,
first-gen), you were never part of the elite. People from
your background typically have some sort of special-
ized tech training as vacworkers or habtechs.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Spacecraft or Freefall skill,
   +10 to a Technical, Academic: [Field], or Profession:
   [Field] skill of your choice, +20 to a Networking:
   [Field] skill of your choice
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All. Use of exotic morphs is
   common.

RE-INSTANTIATED
You were born and raised on Earth, but you did not
survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body
died there, but your backup was transmitted off-world,
and you were one of the lucky few to be re-instantiated
with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead
storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 to a
  Networking: [Field] skill of your choice, +2 Moxie
Disadvantages: Edited Memories trait, 0 Starting
  Credit (can still buy credit with CP)
Common Morphs: Cases, Infomorphs, Synths

SCUMBORN
You were raised in the nomadic and chaotic lifestyle
common to Scum barges.
Advantages: +10 Persuasion or Deception skill, +10
  Scrounging skill, +20 Networking: Autonomists
  skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All, especially Bouncers

UPLIFT
You are not even human. You were born as an uplifted
animal: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, parrot, raven,
crow, or octopus.
Advantages: +10 Fray skill, +10 Perception skill, +20
  to two Knowledge skills of your choice
Disadvantages: Must choose an uplift morph to start
Common Morphs: Neo-Avian, Neo-Hominid,
  Octomorph
CHOOSE FACTION
After choosing your background, you now choose
which primary faction your character belongs to.
This faction most likely represents the grouping that
controls your character’s current home habitat/station,
and to which your character holds allegiance, but this
need not be the case. You may be a dissident member
of your faction, living among them but opposing some
(or all) of their core memes and perhaps agitating for
change. Whatever the case, your faction defines how
your character represents themself in the struggle be-
tween ideologies post-Fall.
  You must choose one of the factions listed below.
Like your character’s background, it will provide your
character with certain skills, traits, limitations, or
other characteristics.
  The factions presented here outline the most numer-
ous and influential among transhumanity, but others
may also exist. At your gamemaster’s discretion, you
may develop another starting faction with them not
included on this list.

ANARCHIST
You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of
social organization and directly democratic decision-
making. You believe power is always corrupting and
everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect
their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive
policies of the Inner system and Jovian Junta, this
makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a ter-
rorist at worst. In your opinion, that’s comedy coming
from governments that keep their populations in line
with economic oppression and threats of violence.
Advantages: +10 to a skill of your choice, +30 Net-
  working: Autonomists skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All

ARGONAUT
You are part of a scientific techno-progressive move-
ment that seeks to solve transhumanity’s injustices and
inequalities with technology. You support universal
access to technology and healthcare, open source
models of production, morphological freedom, and
democratization. You try to avoid factionalism and
divisive politics, seeing transhumanity’s splintering as
a hindrance to its perpetuation.
Advantages: +10 to two Technical, Academic: [Field],
  or Profession: [Field] skills; +20 Networking:
  Scientists
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All

BARSOOMIAN
You call the Martian outback and wilds your home.
You are a “redneck,” a lower-class Martian from the
rural areas that often find themselves in conflict with

the policies and goals of the hypercorp domes and Tha
League.
Advantages: +10 Freerunning, +10 to one skill of your ch
  +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: Cases, Flats, Rusters, Splicers, Synths

BRINKER
You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of
transhumanity and the various goings-on in the rest of
system. Your particular grouping may have sought out
imposed isolation, to pursue their own interests, or they
have been exiled for their unpopular beliefs. Or you
simply be a loner who prefers the vast emptiness of sp
to socializing with others. You might be a religious culti
primitivist, a utopian, or something altogether unintere
in transhumanity.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Spacecraft skill, +10 to a skill of
choice, +20 to a Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
Disadvantages: None

CRIMINAL
You are involved with the crime-oriented underworld.
may work with one of the Sol system’s major criminal
tions—triads, the Night Cartel, the ID Crew, Nine Lives,
Familae—or one of the smaller, local operators with a
stake in a specific habitat. You might be a vetted mem

the next gig.

You are an anarchistic supporter of the free market and
vate property. You oppose government and favor a sys
where security and legal matters are handled by private
petitors. Whether you consider yourself an anarcho-capit

JOVIAN
Your faction is noted for its authoritarian regime, bio-
conservative ideologies, and militaristic tendencies.
Where you come from, technology is not to be trusted to
everyone and humans need to be protected from them-
selves. To ensure its survival, humanity must be able to
defend itself, and unfettered growth must be checked.
Advantages: +10 to two weapon skills of your choice,

Common Morphs: Flats and Splicers

LUNAR
You hail from Luna, the original off-Earth colony
world. Now overpopulated and in decline, Luna is
one of the few places where people still cling to old-
Earth ethnic and national identities. Your home is also
within sight of Earth, a constant reminder that encour-
ages many “Loonies” to be Reclaimers, deploring the
hypercorp interdiction and arguing that you have a
right to return to Earth, terraform it, and re-establish
it as a living homeworld.

MERCURIAL
Your faction has no interest in co-opting their true
natures in order to become more “human.” You might
be an AGI that does not necessarily intertwine its
destiny with transhumanity, or an uplift that seeks
to preserve and promote non-human life (or at least
your own species). You might even be an infomorph or
posthuman who has strayed so far from transhuman
interests and values that you now consider yourself to
be forging a unique new path of life.

This is the future we’ve all been waiting for, and you’re
going to enjoy it to the max. A paradigm shift has oc-
curred, and while everyone else is catching up, your
faction embraces and revels in it. There is no more
want, no more death, no more limits on what you can
be. The scum have immersed themselves in a new way
of life, changing themselves as they see fit, trying out
new experiences, and pushing the boundaries wherever
they can ... and fuck anyone who can’t deal with that.
Advantages: +10 Freefall skill, +10 to a skill of your
  choice, +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All
SOCIALITE
You are a member of the inner system glitterati, the
media-saturated social cliques that set trends, spread
memes, and make or break lives with whispers, in-
nuendo, and backroom deals. You are simultaneously
an icon and a devout follower. Culture isn’t just your
life, it’s your weapon of choice.
Advantages: +10 Persuasion skill, +10 Protocol skill,
   +20 Networking: Media skill
Disadvantages: May not start with flat, pod, uplift, or
   synthetic morphs
Common Morphs: Exalts, Olympians, Sylphs

TITANIAN
You are a participant in the Titanian Commonwealth’s
socialist cyberdemocracy. Unlike other autonomist
projects, Titanian joint efforts have assembled some
impressive infrastructural projects as approved by
the Titanian Plurality and pursued by state-owned
microcorps.
Advantages: +10 to two Technical or Academic skills
  of your choice, +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: All

ULTIMATE
Your faction sees the potential in transhumanity’s
future and looks back upon the rest of transhuman-
ity as weak and hedonistic. Transhumanity is set
to take the next evolutionary step and it’s time for
transhumans to be redesigned to the best of our
capabilities.
Advantages: +10 to two skills of your choice, +20 to a
   Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
Disadvantages: May not start with Flat, Splicer, uplift,
   or pod morphs
Common Morphs: Exalts, Remades

VENUSIAN
You are a supporter of the Morningstar Confedera-
tion of Venusian aerostats, resentful of the growing
influence of the Planetary Consortium and other en-
trenched and conservative inner system powers. You
see your faction’s ascension as a chance to reform the
old guard ways of inner system politics.
Advantages: +10 Pilot: Aircraft, +10 to one skill of
   your choice, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill
Disadvantages: None
Common Morphs: Cases, Exalts, Mentons, Splicers,
   Sylphs, Synths

SPEND FREE POINTS
Each starting character receives an equal number of
free points for things like rep and aptitudes. These
free points are just the start for building your charac-
ter, so don’t fret if you can’t get certain scores as high
as you like. In the next stage of character creation,
you will gain additional points with which you can
customize your character (see Spend Customization
Points, p. 135).

           Tai is making a character. She decides to create a sal-
           vage retrieval/scavenger type who started as a Lunar
           Colonist but is now a Brinker. Together, her background
           and faction give Tai +20 Networking: Autonomists skill,

           to two other skills (one Academic, Professional, or Tech-
           nical) that she’ll choose later.
              Tai starts with 105 points for aptitudes, which works
           out to 15 each. She wants her character to be impulsive
           and antisocial, so right away she lowers both SAV and




STARTING APTITUDES
Your character receives 105 free points to distribute
among their 7 aptitudes: Cognition, Coordination,
Intuition, Reflexes, Savvy, Somatics, and Willpower
(see Aptitudes, p. 123). (That breaks down to an aver-
age of 15 per aptitude, so it may be easiest to give
each 15 and then adjust accordingly, raising some and
lowering others.) Each aptitude must be given at least
5 points (unless you take the Feeble trait, see p. 149),
and no aptitude may be raised higher than 30 (unless
you take the Exceptional Aptitude trait, p. 146). Note
that certain morphs (flats and splicers, for example)
may also put a cap on how high your aptitudes may
be (see Aptitude Maximums, p. 124).
   For simplicity, it is recommended that aptitude
scores be handled as multiples of 5, but this is not a
necessity.

NATIVE TONGUE
Every character receives their natural Language skill
at a rating of 70 + INT for free. This skill may be
raised with CP (see below).

STARTING MOXIE
Every character starts off with a Moxie stat of 1 (see
Moxie, p. 122).

CREDIT
All characters are given 5,000 credits with which to
purchase gear during character creation, unless you
have the Fall Evacuee or Re-instantiated background
(in which case you start with 2,500 or 0 credits, re-
spectively). See Purchasing Gear, p. 136, for more
details.

REP
Your character isn’t a complete newbie. You get 50
rep points to divide between the reputation networks
of your choice (see Reputation and Social Networks,
p. 285).

SPEND CUSTOMIZATION POINTS
Now that you have the basics of your character
fleshed out, you can spend additional Customiza-
tion Points (CP) to fine-tune your character. Each
WIL to 10. She also wants to be smart and fast on her
feet, so takes the extra 10 points that gives her and
raises both COG and REF to 20. So her aptitudes are:

COG COO        INT     REF      SAV     SOM    WIL




                                                          EXAMPLE
 20  15         15      20       10      15    10

   She marks down her Moxie of 1 and gets her native
language (Chinese) at 85, both for free.
   Noting her 5,000 Credits, Tai divides her Rep score
points evenly among @-rep and c-rep, taking 25 in each.

  Example continued on p. 137 ➟ ➟ ➟


  character is given 1,000 CP, which may be used to
  increase aptitudes, buy skills, acquire more Moxie,
  buy more credit, elevate your Rep, or purchase posi-
  tive traits. You may also take on negative traits in
  order to get even more CP with which to customize
  your character. This customization process should be
  used to tweak your character and specialize them in
  the ways you desire.
     If a gamemaster seeks a different level of gameplay,
  they can adjust this CP amount. If the gamemaster
  wants a scenario where the starting characters are
  younger or less experienced, they can lower the CP
  to 800 or even 700. On the other hand, if you want
  to create characters who start off as grizzled veterans,
  you can raise the CP to 1,100 or even 1,200.
     Not all customizations are equal—aptitudes, for ex-
  ample, are considerably more valuable than individual
  skills. To reflect this, CP must be spent at a specific
  ratio according to the specific boost desired.


        CUSTOMIZATION POINTS
        15 CP = 1 Moxie point
        10 CP = 1 aptitude point
         5 CP = 1 psi sleight
         5 CP = 1 specialization
         2 CP = 1 skill point (61-80)
         1 CP = 1 skill point (up to 60)
         1 CP = 1,000 credit
         1 CP = 10 Rep
        Trait and morph costs vary as noted.


  CUSTOMIZING APTITUDES
  Raising your aptitude score is quite expensive at 10
  CP per aptitude point. As noted above, no aptitude
  may be increased above 30. Keep in mind that your
  morph may also provide certain aptitude bonuses.

  INCREASING MOXIE
  Moxie may be raised at the cost of 15 CP per Moxie
  point. The maximum to which Moxie may be raised
  is 10.

%%% txt/138.txt
LEARNED SKILLS
Each character must purchase a minimum of 400 skill
points of Active skills and 300 skill points of Knowl-
edge skills (see Skills, p. 170). Skills are bought at the
cost of 1 CP per point. Keep in mind that learned
skills start at the rating of the linked aptitude. For
example, if you want to raise a skill to 30 and the
skill’s linked aptitude is 10, you’ll need to spend 20 CP.
Skill bonuses from background or faction should also
be applied to the rating before you start raising the
skill. For simplicity, it is recommended that skills be
purchased as multiples of 5, but this is not a necessity.
  Raising a skill over 60 is expensive. Each point over
60 costs double. Raising a skill with a linked attribute
of 20 up to 70 would cost 60 CP: 40 points to get from
20 to 60, and 20 more points to get from 60 to 70.
  No learned skill may be raised over 80 during char-
acter creation (unless you have the Expert trait, p. 146).
  Though Knowledge skills are grouped into 5 skills,
each is a field skill (p. 172), meaning that it can be
taken multiple times with different fields.
  A complete list of skills can be found on p. 176.

SPECIALIZATIONS
Specializations (p. 173) may also be purchased at the
cost of 5 CP per specialization. You may purchase
specializations for both Active and Knowledge skills.
Only 1 specialization may be purchased per skill, and
they may only be bought for skills with a rating of
30+.

BUYING MORE CREDIT
If you want more cred to spend on gear, every CP will
get you 1,000 credits. See Purchase Gear, p. 136, for
details on buying stuff. The maximum CP you can
spend on additional credits is 100.

INCREASING REP
If you want your character to start play with lots of
social capital, you can increase your Rep score(s) at
the cost of 1 CP per 10 additional points. No indi-
vidual Rep score may be raised above 80, and the
maximum amount of CP that may be spent on Rep
is 35 points.

STARTING MORPH
Perhaps the most important use of CP is to buy the
morph with which your character begins play. This
may be the original bodily form in which your charac-
ter started life, or it may simply be the sleeve they are
currently inhabiting.
  Available morphs are listed starting on p. 139.
  Note that any aptitude or skill bonuses provided by
the morph are applied after all CP are spent. In other
words, these bonuses do not affect the costs of buying
aptitude and skill points during character generation.
No aptitude may be modified over 40.

PURCHASING TRAITS
Traits represent specific qualities your character has
that may help or hinder them.
   Positive traits supply bonuses in certain situations,
and each has a listed CP cost. You may not spend
more than 50 CP on positive traits.
   Negative traits inflict disadvantages on your charac-
ter, but they also give you extra CP that you can spend
on customizing your character. You may not purchase
more than 50 CP worth of negative traits, and no
more than 25 CP may be negative morph traits.
   Positive traits are listed on p. 145, negative traits on
p. 148. Note that traits you receive from your back-
ground or faction do not cost or provide you with
bonus CP.
   Traits listed as morph traits apply to the morph, and
not the ego. If the character switches to a new morph,
these traits are lost (and new morph traits may be
gained). Morph traits may be bought like other traits
during character generation.

PSI SLEIGHTS
Characters who purchase the Psi trait (p. 147) may
spend CP to purchase sleights (see Sleights, p. 223).
These represent specific psi abilities the character has
learned. The cost to buy a sleight is 5 CP. No more

            Tai now has 1,000 points to customize. She wants to be
            lucky, so she starts right off spending 60 (4 x 15) CP to
            raise her Moxie from 1 to 5. She also decides that she
            wants her character to be better at spotting things, so
            she raises her INT from 15 to 20, at a cost of 50 CP (5 x
            10). So far, she’s spent 110 CP.
               She must buy at least 400 points of Active skills, so she
            tackles that next. She knows that skills are based on apti-
            tudes and they get more expensive over 60, so she decides
            the most she’ll spend on any single skill is 40 (since her
            highest aptitude is 20). She picks out her skills, assigns the
            points, and adds them to the starting aptitudes.
               This is what she starts with, noting the points she
            spent on each and the total value (counting aptitude)
            in parentheses.
  EXAMPLE




               Beam Weapons (COO) 30 (45), Climbing (SOM) 30
            (45), Demolitions (COG) 40 (60), Fray (REF) 30 (50),
            Freefall (REF) 40 (60), Freerunning (SOM) 30 (45),
            Hardware: Aerospace (COG) 40 (60), Infiltration (COO)

            (60), Perception (INT) 40 (60), Persuasion (SAV) 20 (30),
            Research (COG) 20 (40), and Scrounging (INT) 40 (60).
               This costs her 450 CP, so she’s spent a total of 560
            CP so far.
               Now she spends her 300 points of Knowledge skills:
               Academics: Astrophysics (COG) 40 (60), Academics:
            Engineering (COG) 40 (60), Academics: Fall History

 than 5 psi-chi and 5 psi-gamma sleights may be bought
 during character creation.
    Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from
 sleights are treated as modifications; they are applied
 after all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of
 buying skills or aptitudes during character creation.

 PURCHASE GEAR
 No matter what faction you are from, you use Credit
 to buy gear during character creation. A complete list
 of gear and costs can be found in the Gear chapter, p.
 294. The average costs for each cost category should
 be used when calculating gear prices.


                       GEAR COSTS
CATEGORY           RANGE (CREDITS)            AVERAGE (CREDITS)
Trivial                    1–99                          50
Low                      100–499                        250
Moderate                500–1,499                      1,000
High                   1,500–9,999                     5,000
Expensive                10,000+                      20,000
    This costs her another 350 CP, bringing her total spent
CP to 910.
    Adding in her background and faction skills, she also
has Networking: Autonomists (SAV) 30, Networking:
Hypercorps (SAV) 30, Pilot: Spacecraft (REF) 30 (50),
Pilot: Groundcraft (REF) 30 (50). She takes the freebie
+10 and adds it to Fray (raising it to 60) and applies the
other +10 to Academics: Economics (COG) 30.
    With 90 CP left, Tai moves on to Rep. Tai wants to
have a lot of good connections, so she raises both of her
Rep scores by 30 points each, at a cost of 6 CP. She also
decides she needs some credibility with criminal types,
so she buys g-rep at 40, for 4 more CP. Now she has 80
CP left.
    Tai’s character needs a body, and she decides a
                                                              EXAMPLE



bouncer is most suited for the nomadic, spacefaring
lifestyle of her brinker. That costs another 40 CP, leaving
her with 50 CP left to spend.
    Looking back at her skills, she decides to raise her
Pilot: Spacecraft from 50 to 70. It costs her 10 CP to
raise the skill to 60, and another 20 CP to raise it from
60 to 70, for a total cost of 30 CP. She also wants to
raise her Scrounging from 60 to 70, for a 20 CP cost.
That nicely uses up the last of her CP.
    Scanning the traits, though, Tai also decides that
Situational Awareness would be a good choice for her
scavenger. At a cost of 10 CP, she would need to take an-
other negative trait to compensate. She chooses Neural
Damage (synaesthesia)—a condition she inherited from
a rampaging nanovirus during the Fall.
    Tai’s points are now all evened out and spent.




     Every character starts off with one piece of gear
  for free: a standard muse (p. 332). This is the digital
  AI companion that the character has had since they
  were a child. Additionally, each character starts with 1
  month of backup insurance (p. 330) at no cost.
     There is no limitation other than what the game-
  master allows on what gear characters can and cannot
  buy during character creation. Both the players and
  gamemaster should keep the character’s background
  and faction in mind. Since some gear is likely very
  restricted in some habitats if not outright illegal, there
  needs to be a plausible explanation for who and how
  a character from such a place might have such gear.
  If there isn’t, then the gamemaster can choose not to
  allow it. The starting locale for a game should also
  be considered. A character from the restrictive Jovian
  Republic might have a hard time explaining how they
  have an illegal cornucopia machine back in the Re-
  public, but if the game takes place on board a scum
  barge where everything is available and anything goes,
  then such an explanation becomes much easier.
     Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from gear
  are treated as modifications; they are applied after
  all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of buying
  skills or aptitudes during character creation.

%%% txt/140.txt
CHOOSE MOTIVATIONS
The next step is to choose 3 personal motivations
 for your character (see Motivations, p. 121). These
 are memes, in the form of ideologies or goals, which
your character is pursuing. These may be as specific
“undermine the local triad boss” or as broad as “pro-
 mote hypercapitalism,” and they may be short term
 or long term. Some sample motivations are provided
 on the Example Motivations table (p. 138). You
 should work with your gamemaster when choosing
your motivations, as they can be used to propel the
 storyline forward and specific scenarios can be con-
 structed around your character’s goals. Some of your
 character’s motivations may change later (see Chang-
 ing Motivation, p. 152). Motivations will help your
 character regain Moxie (p. 122) and earn extra Rez
 Points during gameplay (p. 384).
    Motivations should be listed on your character
 sheet as a single term or short phrase, along with a +
 or – symbol to denote whether they support or oppose
 it. For example, “+Fame” would indicate that your
 character seeks to become a famous media personality,
 whereas “–Reclaim Earth” means that your character
 opposes the goal of reclaiming Earth.

FINAL TOUCHES
Now that you have everything settled, there are a few
final steps.

REMAINING STATS
A few stats now need to be calculated and added to
your character sheet:

 • Lucidity (p. 122) equals your character’s WIL x 2.
 • Trauma Threshold (p. 122) equals your LUC
   divided by 5 (round up).
 • Insanity Rating (p. 122) equals LUC x 2.
 • Initiative (p. 121) equals your character’s (REF +
   INT) x 2.
 • Damage Bonus (p. 123) for melee equals SOM ÷
   10 (round down).
 • Death Rating (p. 122) equals DUR x
   1.5 (biomorphs, round up) or DUR x 2
   (synthmorphs)
 • Speed (p. 121) equals 1 (3 for infomorphs), modi-
   fied as appropriate by implants.

%%% txt/141.txt
DETAILING THE CHARACTER
The final step in character creation is filling in the de-
tails and figuring out what your character is like and
what they are all about. Your character’s Background
is a good place to start as it says where they came, but
it could be expanded. What did they think of their
childhood? Do they still have ties from there? How
did they move from such origins to the Faction they
are part of? Are they fully supportive of their Faction’s
goals, or are they in opposition? How does the charac-
ter view other Factions?
   Next, take a look at the skills and other defining
points—these also tell a story. How did they acquire
those skills? Why? How did they develop their Rep
score (or lack of one)? How did they get connected
with the groupings represented by their Networking
skills? What do the character’s traits say about them?
How did they get their current morph? Is it their
original? If not, what happened to their first body?
   Also taking into account the major factor of Moti-
vations, all of these questions will help you build a de-
fining picture of your character. Not everything about
your character needs to be filled out, of course—it’s
ok to leave a few blanks that you can fill in later. As-
sembling the points you have deduced so far will help
you to present your character as a whole, unique indi-
vidual, however, rather than just a blank template.
   As a final step, take a few minutes to pick out some
specific identifying features and personality quirks that
will help you define the character to others. This could
be a way of talking, a strongly-projected attitude, a
catchphrase they use frequently, a unique look or style
of dress, a repetitive behavior, an annoying manner-
ism, or anything else similar that is easy to latch onto.
Such idiosyncrasies give something that other players
can latch onto, spurring roleplaying opportunities.



STARTING MORPHS
Each morph has an associated CP cost. It also sup-
plies the character’s Durability and Wound Threshold
stats, and may modify Initiative, Speed, and certain
aptitudes and learned skills. A credit cost is also listed,
but this refers to the cost of buying such a morph in
gameplay.
   Flexible Aptitude Bonuses: Some morphs have ap-
titude bonuses that may be applied to an aptitude of
the player’s choice. This reflects that not all morphs
are created equal. When assigning these universal ap-
titude bonuses, each boost must be applied to a sepa-
rate aptitude; you may not elevate an aptitude that
is already raised by that morph. Once an individual
morph’s aptitude bonuses have been assigned, they
are permanent for that morph (i.e., if another char-
acter resleeves into that morph, the bonuses remain
the same).

BIOMORPHS
Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (usually
equipped with implants), birthed naturally or in an
exowomb, and grown to adulthood either naturally
or at a slightly accelerated rate.

FLATS
Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all
of the natural defects, hereditary diseases, and other
genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly applies.
Flats are increasingly rare—most died off with the rest
of humanity during the Fall. Most new children are
splicers—screened and genefixed at the least—except
in habitats where flats are treated as second-class citi-
zens and indentured labor.
Implants: None
Aptitude Maximum: 20
Durability: 30
Wound Threshold: 6
Disadvantages: None (Genetic Defects trait common)

SPLICERS
Splicers are genefixed humans. Their genome has
been cleansed of hereditary diseases and optimized
for looks and health, but has not otherwise been
substantially upgraded. Splicers make up the major-
ity of transhumanity.
Implants: Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts,
   Cortical Stack
Aptitude Maximum: 25
Durability: 30
Wound Threshold: 6
Advantages: +5 to one aptitude of the player’s choice
CP Cost: 10
Credit Cost: High

EXALTS
Exalt morphs are genetically-enhanced humans, de-
signed to emphasize specific traits. Their genetic code
has been tweaked to make them healthier, smarter,
and more attractive. Their metabolism is modified to
predispose them towards staying fit and athletic for
the duration of an extended lifespan.
Implants: Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts,

Aptitude Maximum: 30
Durability: 35
Wound Threshold: 7
Advantages: +5 COG, +5 to three other aptitudes of
   the player’s choice
CP Cost: 30
Credit Cost: Expensive

MENTONS
Mentons are genetically modified to increase cogni-
tive abilities, particularly learning ability, creativity,
attentiveness, and memory. Rumors exist of super-
enhanced mentons with more extreme intelligence
mods, but brain-hacking is notoriously difficult, and
many attempts to redesign mental faculties result in
impaired functioning, instability, or insanity.

OLYMPIANS
Olympians are human upgrades with improved

Sylph morphs are tailor-made for media icons, elite
socialites, XP stars, models, and narcissists. Sylph
gene sequences are specifi cally designed for dis-
tinctive good looks. Ethereal and elfin features are
common, with slim and lithe bodies. Their metabo-
lism has also been sanitized to eliminate unpleasant
bodily odors and their pheromones adjusted for
universal appeal.

FURIES
Furies are combat morphs. These transgenic human
upgrades feature genetics tailored for endurance,
strength, and reflexes, as well as behavioral modifica-
tions for aggressiveness and cunning. To offset tenden-
cies for unruliness and macho behavior patterns, furies
feature gene sequences promoting pack mentalities and
cooperation, and they tend to be biologically female.

FUTURAS
An exalt variant, futura morphs were specially crafted
for the “Lost generation.” Tailor-made for acceler-
ated growth and adjusted for confidence, self-reliance,
and adaptability, futuras were intended to help tran-
shumanity regain its foothold. These programs proved
disastrous and the line was discontinued, but some
models remain, viewed by some with distaste and
others as collectibles or exotic oddities.

HIBERNOIDS
Hibernoids are transgenic-modified humans with
heavily-altered sleep patterns and metabolic processes.
Hibernoids have a decreased need for sleep, requiring

%%% txt/143.txt
only 1-2 hours a day on average. They also have the
ability to trigger a form of voluntary hibernation,
effectively stopping their metabolism and need for
oxygen. Hibernoids make excellent long-duration
space travelers and habtechs, but these morphs are
also favored by personal aides and hypercapitalists
with non-stop lifestyles.

and less resource-depleting, making them ideal for
habitat living and spacecraft. Some people find neo-
tenic sleeves distasteful, especially when employed in
certain media and sex work capacities.

REMADE
The remade are completely redesigned humans:
humans 2.0. Their cardiovascular systems are stronger,
the digestive tract has been sanitized and restructured
to eliminate flaws, and they have otherwise been opti-
mized for good health, smarts, and longevity with nu-
merous transgenic mods. The remade are popular with
the ultimates faction. The remade look close to human,
but are different in very noticeable and sometimes eerie
ways: taller, lack of hair, slightly larger craniums, wider
eyes, smaller noses, smaller teeth, and elongated digits.

NEO-AVIANS
Neo-avians include ravens, crows, and gray parrots
uplifted to human-level intelligence. Their physical
sizes are much larger than their non-uplifted cous-
ins (to the size of a human child), with larger heads
for their increased brain size. Numerous transgenic
modifications have been made to their wings, allow-
ing them to retain limited flight capabilities at 1 g,
but giving them a more bat-like physiology so they
can bend and fold better, and adding primitive digits
for basic tool manipulation. Their toes are also more
articulated and now accompanied with an opposable
thumb. Neo-avians have adapted well to microgravity
environments, and are favored for their small size and
reduced resource use.

OCTOMORPHS
These uplifted octopi sleeves have proven quite useful
in zero-gravity environments. They retain eight arms,

               their chameleon ability to change skin
            color, ink sacs, and a sharp beak. They also
         have increased cranial capacity and longev-
     ity, can breathe both air and water, and lack a
 skeletal structure so they can squeeze through tight
spaces. Octomorphs typically crawl along in zero-
gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for
propulsion and can even walk on two of their arms
in low gravity. Their eyes have been enhanced with
color vision, provide a 360-degree field of vision, and
they rotationally adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil
aligned with “up.” A transgenic vocal system allows
them to speak.

PODS
Pods (from “pod people”) are vat-grown, biological
bodies with extremely undeveloped brains that are
augmented with an implanted computer and cybernet-
ics system. Though typically run by an AI, pods are
socially unfavored in some stations, utilized in slave
labor in others, and even illegal in some areas. Because
pods underwent accelerated growth in their creation,
and were mostly grown as separate parts and then
                        assembled, their biological
                     design includes some shortcuts
                 and limitations, offset with implants
               and regular maintenance. They lack
          reproductive capabilities. In many habitats,
       their legal status is a hotly-contested issue.
      Unless otherwise noted, pods are also consid-
 ered biomorphs for all rules purposes.

PLEASURE PODS
Pleasure pods are exactly what they seem—faux
humans designed purely for intimate entertainment
purposes. Pleasure pods have extra nerve clusters in
their erogenous zones, fine motor control over certain
muscle groups, enhanced pheromones, sanitized me-
tabolisms, and the genetics for purring. Naturally, they
are crafted for good looks and charisma and enhanced
in other areas as well. Pleasure pods are capable of
switching their sex at will to male, female, hermaph-
rodite, or neuter.

NOVACRAB
Novacrabs are a pod design bio-engineered from
coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a
larger (human) size. Novacrabs are ideal for hazard-
ous work environments as well as vacworker, police,
or bodyguard duties, giving their ten 2-meter long legs,
massive claws, and chitinous armor. They climb and
handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide
range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure
changes) from vacuum to deep sea. Novacrabs feature

SYNTHETIC MORPHS
   Synthetic morphs are completely artificial/robotic.
They are usually operated by AIs or via remote con-
trol, but the lack of available biomorphs after the
Fall meant that many infugees resorted to resleeving
in robotic shells, which were also cheaper, quicker to
manufacture, and more widely available. Neverthe-
less, synthmorphs are viewed with disdain in many
habitats, an option that only the poor and desperate
accept to be sleeved in. Synthetic morphs are not
without with their advantages, however, and so are
commonly used for menial labor, heavy labor, habitat
construction, and security services.
  All synthmorphs have the following advantages:

  • Lack of Biological Functions. Synthmorphs need
    not be bothered with trivialities like breathing,
    eating, defecating, aging, sleeping, or any similar
    minor but crucial aspects of biological life.
  • Pain Filter. Synthmorphs can filter out their
    pain receptors, so that they are unhampered by
    wounds or physical damage. This allows them
    to ignore the –10 modifier from 1 wound (see
    Wound Effects, p. 207), but they suffer –30 on
    any tactile-based Perception Tests and will not
    even notice they have been damaged unless they
    succeed in a (modified) Perception Test.
  • Immunity to Shock Weapons. Synthmorphs have
    no nervous system to disrupt, and their optical
    electronics are carefully shielded from interfer-
    ence. Shock attacks may temporarily disrupt their
    wireless radio communications, however, for the
    duration of the attack.
  • Environmental Durability. Synthmorphs are
    built to withstand a wide range of environments,
    from dusty Mars to the oceans of Europa to the
    vacuum of space. They are unaffected by any but
    the most extreme temperatures and atmospheric
    pressures. Treat as Temperature Tolerance (p.
    305) and Vacuum Sealing (p. 305).
  • Toughness. Synthetic shells are made to last—a
    fact reflected in their higher Durability and built-
       in Armor ratings. Their composition also makes
       their physical strikes more damaging: apply a +2
       DV modifier on unarmed attacks for human-sized
       shells and larger.

CASE
Cases are extremely cheap, mass-produced robotic
shells intended to provide an affordable remor-
phing option for the millions of infugees created by
the Fall. Though many varieties of case bot models
exist, they are uniformly regarded as shoddy and
inferior. Most case morphs are vaguely anthromor-
phic, with a thin framework body, standing just
shorter than an average human, and suffer from
frequent malfunctions.

SYNTH
Synths are anthromorphic robotic shells (androids
and gynoids). They are typically used for menial
labor jobs where pods are not as good of an option.
Cheaper than many other morphs, they are com-
monly used for people who need a morph quickly
and cheaply or simply on a transient basis. Though
they look humanoid, synths are easily recognizable
as non-biological unless they have the synthetic mask
option (p. 311).

ARACHNOIDS
Arachnoid robotic shells are 1-meter in length, seg-
mented into two parts, with a smaller head, like a
spider or termite. They feature four pairs of 1.5-meter-
long retractable arms/legs, capable of rotating around
the axis of the body, with built-in hydraulics for
propelling the bot with small leaps. The manipula-
tor claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with
extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating

%%% txt/146.txt

the head allows for closer handling and tool use. In
zero-G environments, arachnoids can retract their
arms/legs and maneuver with vectored air thrusters.

FLEXBOTS
Designed for multi-purpose functions, flexbots can
transform their shells to suit a range of situations
and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen
interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable
of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multi-
legged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others.
Each module features its own sensor units and “bush
robot” fractal-branching digits (each capable of break-
ing into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale,
allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot
control computer is also distributed between modules.
Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but
multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass
operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as
demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics as-
sembly, and so on.

REAPER
The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of
biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleop-
eration or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form
is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a
thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector thrust nozzles
to maneuver in microgravity, and also takes advan-
tage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance.
Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods
are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made
of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon
mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even
to change shape and length. In gravity environments,
the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs.
Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and
bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise
eyebrows, if not get you arrested.

SLITHEROIDS
Slitheroid bots are synthetic shells taking the form of
a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake, with two re-
tractable arms for tool use. Snake bots can coil, twist,
and roll their bodies into a ball or hoop, moving either
by slithering, burrowing, rolling, or pulling themselves
along by their arms. The sensor suite and control com-
puter are housed in the head.

SWARMANOID
The swarmanoid is not a single shell per se, but rather
a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic micro-
drones. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling,
rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter

%%% txt/147.txt
fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer and
sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm.
Though the swarm can “meld” together into a roughly
child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling
physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a
unit. Individual bugs are quite capable of interfacing
with electronics.

TRAITS
Unless otherwise noted, listed traits are ego traits.

POSITIVE TRAITS
Positive traits provide bonuses to the character in
certain situations.

ADAPTABILITY
Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
  Resleeving is a breeze for this character. They adjust
to new morphs much more quickly than most other
people. Apply a +10 modifier per level for Integration
Tests and Alienation Tests (p. 272).

ALLIES
Cost: 30 CP
   The character is part of or has a relationship with
some influential group that they can occasionally call
on for support. For example, this could be their old
gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers,
a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social
clique. The gamemaster and player should work out
what the character’s relationship is with this group,
and why the character can call on them for aid.
Gamemaster’s should take care that these allies are
not abused, such as calling on them more than once
per game session. The character’s ties to this group
are also a two-way street—they will be expected to
perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a
potential plot seed for scenarios).

AMBIDEXTROUS
Cost: 10 CP
  The character can use and manipulate objects
equally well with both hands (they do not suffer the
off-hand modifier, as noted on p. 193). If the char-
acter has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles,
etc), this trait may be applied to a limb other than
the hand. This trait may be taken multiple times for
multiple limbs.

ANIMAL EMPATHY
Cost: 5 CP
  The character has an instinctive feel for handling
and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds.
Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests
or whenever the character makes a test to influence or
interact with an animal.

BRAVE
Cost: 10 CP
  This character does not scare easily, and will face
threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm with-
out flinching. As a side effect, the character is not
always the best at gauging risks, especially when it
comes to factoring in danger to others. The charac-
ter receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear
or intimidation.

COMMON SENSE
Cost: 10 CP
  The character has an innate sense of judgment that
cuts through other distractions and factors that might
cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player
may ask the gamemaster what choice they should
make or what course of action they should take, and
the gamemaster should give them solid advice based
on what the character knows. Alternately, if the
character is about to make a disastrous decision, the
gamemaster can use the character’s free hint and warn
the player they are making a mistake.

DANGER SENSE
Cost: 10 CP
  The character has an intuitive sixth sense that warns
them of imminent threats. They receive a +10 modifier
on Surprise Tests (p. 204).

DIRECTION SENSE
Cost: 5 CP
   Somehow the character always knows which way
is up, north, etc., even when blinded. The character
receives a +10 modifier for figuring out complex di-
rections, reading maps, and remembering or retracing
a path they have taken.

%%% txt/148.txt
EIDETIC MEMORY (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 CP
  Much like a computer, the character has perfect
memory recall. They can remember anything they have
sensed, often even from a single glance. This works the
same as the eidetic memory implant (p. 301).

EXCEPTIONAL APTITUDE
Cost: 20 CP
  The character may raise one of their maximum
aptitude up to 10 points over the normal aptitude cap
(30 for flats, 35 for splicers, 40 for all others). Note
that this trait just raises the maximum, it does not
give the character more 10 aptitude points. This trait
may be taken only once.

EXPERT
Cost: 10 CP
  The character is a legend in the use of one particular
skill. The character may raise one learned skill over 80,
to a maximum of 90, during character creation. This
trait does not actually increase the skill, it just raises
the maximum. This trait may only be taken once.

FAST LEARNER
Cost: 10 CP
  The character improves skills and learns new
ones in half the time it normally takes (see Improv-
ing Skills, p. 152).

FIRST IMPRESSION
Cost: 10 CP
  The character has a way of charming or otherwise
making a good impression the first time they interact
with someone. This innate social lubricant allows them
to more readily deal with new contacts and slip right
into new social environments. Apply a +10 modifier
on social skill tests when the character is interacting
with another character for the first time only.

HYPER LINGUIST
Cost: 10 CP
   The character has an intuitive understanding of
linguistic structures that facilitates learning new
languages easily. The character requires one-third the
normal amount of time and experience to learn any
language (see Improving Skills, p. 152). The character
can also learn any human language in one day simply
by constant immersive exposure to it. Additionally,
the character receives a +10 modifier when attempting
to interpret languages they don’t know.

IMPROVED IMMUNE SYSTEM (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
   The morph’s immune system is robust and more
resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins—even more
than basic bio-mods. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier
whenever making a test to resist infection or the ef-
fects of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modi-
fier to +20. This trait is only available to biomorphs.
INNOCUOUS (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 CP
  In an age when exotic appearances and good looks
are commonplace, the morph’s look is surprisingly
bland and undistinguished, in that cookie cutter sort of
way. The character’s physical looks are so mundane that
others have a hard time picking them out of a crowd,
describing their appearance, or otherwise remember-
ing physical details. Apply a –10 modifier to all tests
made to spot, describe, or remember the character. This
modifier does not apply to psi or mesh searches.

LIMBER (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
   The morph is especially flexible and supple, capable
of graceful contortions and interesting positions. At
Level 1, the character can smoke with their toes, do the
splits, and squeeze into small, cramped spaces. At Level
2, they are double-jointed escape artists. Each level pro-
vides a +10 modifier to escaping from bonds, fitting into
narrow confines, and other acts relying on contortion or
flexibility. This trait is only available to biomorphs.

MATH WIZ
Cost: 10 CP
  The character can perform any feat of calculation,
including the most complex and advanced math-
ematics, instantly and with great precision, with the
same ease an unmodified human can add 2 + 3. The
character can calculate odds with great precision, find
correlations in numerical data, and perform similar
tasks with great ease. Apply a +30 modifier on tests
involving math calculations.

NATURAL IMMUNITY (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 CP
   The morph has a natural immunity to a specific
drug, disease, or toxin. When afflicted with that spe-
cific chemical, poison, or pathogen, the character re-
mains unaffected. At the gamemaster’s discretion, this
immunity may not apply to certain agents. It may not
be applied to nanodrugs or nanotoxins. This trait is
only available to biomorphs.

PAIN TOLERANCE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
  The character has a high threshold for pain toler-
ance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on
their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them
to ignore the –10 modifier from 1 wound. Level
2 allows them to ignore the –10 modifiers from 2
wounds. This trait is only available for biomorphs.

PATRON
Cost: 30 CP
   The character has an influential person in their
life who can be relied on for occasional support.
This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a
high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker
with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon,

%%% txt/149.txt
this patron can pull strings on the character’s behalf,
supply resources, introduce them to people they need
to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player
and gamemaster should work together to define ex-
actly who this NPC is and what their relationship
with the player character is. Specifically, the question
of why this patron is supporting the character should
be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies?
the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters
should be careful that this trait does not get abused.
The patron should be an occasional help (probably
no more than once per game session at most) but is
not always at the character’s beck-and-call. If the
character asks for too much, too often, they should
find the patron’s support drying up. Additionally, the
character may need to take action to maintain the
relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the
patron’s behalf. In fact, the character may only have
their patronage because they are on-call or of use to
the NPC in some way.

PSI
Cost: 20 CP (Level 1), 25 CP (Level 2)
  The character has been infected with the Watts-
MacLeod strain of the Exsurgent virus, which altered
their brain structure and opened the potential for their
mind to enhance their cognitive abilities and read and
manipulate the biological minds of others (see Psi,
p. 220). The character may purchase and learn psi
sleights (p. 223). At Level 1, the character may only
use psi-chi sleights. At Level 2, the character may use
both psi-chi and psi-gamma sleights.
  Though this trait is not very expensive, gamemasters
should not allow it to be abused. There are a number
of negative side effects to Watts-MacLeod infection,
noted under Psi Drawbacks, p. 220.
PSI CHAMELEON (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 CP
  The character’s mental state is naturally resistant to
psi sensing. Apply a –10 modifier to any attempts to
locate or detect the character via psi sleights.

PSI DEFENSE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
  The character’s mind is inherently resistant to
mental attacks. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier to
all defense tests made against psi attacks. At Level 2,
apply a +20 modifier.

RAPID HEALER (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 CP
  The morph recovers from damage more quickly.
Reduce the timeframes for healing by half, as noted
on the Healing table, p. 208. This trait is only avail-
able to biomorphs.

RIGHT AT HOME
Cost: 10 CP
  The character chooses one type of morph (splicer,
neo-hominid, case, etc.). The character always
feels right at home in morphs of this type. When
resleeving into this type of morph, the character au-
tomatically adjusts to the new body, no Integration
or Alienation Test needed, suffering no penalties and
no mental stress.

SECOND SKIN
Cost: 15 CP
   If your character background or faction enforces a
restriction on your starting morph (for example, up-
lifts must start with an uplift morph), this trait allows
you to ignore that restriction and purchase a starting
morph of your choice.

%%% txt/150.txt
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
Cost: 10 CP
  The character is very good at maintaining con-
tinuous partial awareness of the goings-on in their
immediate environment. In game terms, they do not
suffer the Distracted modifier on Perception Tests
to notice things even when their attention is focused
elsewhere, or when making Quick Perception Tests
during combat.

STRIKING LOOKS (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
   In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are
both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however,
possesses a physical look that can only be described as
striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and
fascinating—even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati
take notice. On social skill tests where the character’s
beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for
Level 1) or +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This modifier
is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the
infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only avail-
able to biomorphs.
   This modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs,
but at half the cost, and it is only effective against
characters with that specific uplift background (i.e.,
neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).
   The one drawback to this trait is that the character
is more easily noticed and remembered.

TOUGH (MORPH TRAIT)
Cost: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP
   This morph is resilient than others of its type and
can take more physical abuse. Increase their Durabil-
ity by +5 per level (+5 at Level 1, +10 at Level 2, and
+15 at Level 3). This also increases Wound Threshold
by +1, +2, and +3 respectively.

ZOOSEMIOTICS
Cost: 5
  A character with this trait and the Psi trait does
not suffer a modifier when using psi sleights on non-
sentient or partly-sentient animal species.

NEGATIVE TRAITS
  Negative traits generally hinder the character and
apply negative modifiers in certain circumstances.

ADDICTION (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 5 CP (Minor), 10 CP (Moderate), or 20 CP
   (Major)
  Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting
the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The
character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317),
stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that
impacts the character’s physical or mental health.
Players and gamemasters should work together to
agree on addictions that are appropriate for their
game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity:
minor, moderate, or major:
   Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under
control—it does not ruin the character’s life, though
it may create some difficulties. The character may not
even recognize or admit they have a problem. The
character must indulge the addiction at least once
a week, though they can go for longer without too
much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose,
they suffer a –10 modifier on all actions until they get
their fix.
   Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing.
The character obviously has a problem, and must
satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail
to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive
behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until
they indulge their craving. Apply a –20 modifier to
all of the character’s actions until they get their fix.
Additionally, a character with this level of addiction
suffers a –5 DUR penalty.
   Major: A character with a major addiction is on
the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6
hours, and suffer a –10 DUR penalty as their health
is affected. If they fail to get their regular dosage, they
suffer a –30 modifier on all actions until they do. If
their life hasn’t already been ruined by their obsession,
it soon will be.

AGED (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
  The morph is physically aged, and has not been
rejuvenated. Old morphs are increasingly uncom-
mon, though some people adopt them hoping to
gain an air of seniority and respectability. Reduce
the character’s aptitude maximums by 5, and apply
a –10 modifier on all physical actions.
  This trait may only be applied to flat and splicer
morphs.

BAD LUCK
Bonus: 30 CP
   Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence,
things seem to go wrong around the character. The
gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal
to the character’s Moxie stat, which also refreshes
at the same rate as the character’s Moxie. Only the
gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and
the purpose is to use it against the character. In other
words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to
cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a
roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that fol-
lows the character, the gamemaster can even use this
bad Moxie against the character’s friends and allies,
when they are doing something with or related to
the character, though this should be used sparingly.
Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the
character should remember that the player asked for
it by purchasing this trait.

%%% txt/151.txt
BLACKLISTED
Bonus: 5 or 20 CP
   The character has managed to get themselves
blacklisted in certain circles, whether they actually
did something to deserve it or not. In game terms, the
character is barred from having a Rep score higher
than 0 in one particular reputation network. People
within that network will refuse to help the character
out of fear of reprisals and ruining their own reputa-
tion. The bonus for this trait is 20 CP if chosen for the
rep network pertaining to the character’s own starting
faction, and 5 CP if chosen for any other.

BLACK MARK
Bonus: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2),
   or 30 (Level 3) CP
  At some point in the character’s past, they managed
to do something that earned a black mark on their
reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do,
this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to
haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character
picks one faction. Every time they interact with this
faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC
from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who
the character is, they suffer a –10 modifier per level.

COMBAT PARALYSIS
Bonus: 20 CP
  The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing
in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in
headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the
character, or they are surprised, the character must
make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in
any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and
simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to
the situation.

EDITED MEMORIES
Bonus: 10 CP
  At some point in the character’s past, the charac-
ter had certain memories strategically removed or
otherwise lost to them. This may have been done to
intentionally forget an unpleasant or shameful experi-
ence or to make a break with the past. The memory
may also have been lost by an unexpected death (with
no recent backup), or it may have been erased against
the character’s will. Whatever the case, the memory
should bear some importance, and there should exist
either evidence of what happened or NPCs who know
the full story. This is a tool the gamemaster can use to
haunt the character at some future point with ghosts
from their past.

ENEMY
Bonus: 10 CP
  At some point in their past, the character made
an enemy for life who continues to haunt them. The
gamemaster and player should work out the details on
this enmity, and the gamemaster should use the enemy
as an occasional threat, surprise, and hindrance.
FEEBLE
Bonus: 20 CP
  The character is particularly weak with one aptitude.
That aptitude must be purchased at a rating lower
than 5, and may never be upgraded during character
advancement. The aptitude maximum is 10, no matter
what morph the character is wearing.

FRAIL (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
   This morph is not as resilient as others of its type.
Its Durability is reduced by 5 per level. This also re-
duces Wound Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively.

GENETIC DEFECT (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP or 20 CP
  The morph is not genefixed, and in fact suffers
from a genetic disorder or other impairing mutation.
The player and gamemaster should agree on a defect
appropriate to their game. Some possibilities include:
heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell dis-
ease, hypertension, hemophilia, or color blindness.
A genetic disorder that creates minor complications
and/or occasional health problems would be worth
10 CP, a defect that significantly impairs the charac-
ter’s regular functioning or that inflicts chronic health
problems is worth 20 CP. The gamemaster must de-
termine the exact effects of the disorder on gameplay,
as appropriate.
  This trait is only available for flats.

IDENTITY CRISIS
Bonus: 10 CP
   The character’s ego has trouble adapting itself to
the changed look of a new morph—they are stuck
with the mental image of their original body, and
simply do not grow accustomed to their new face(s).
As a result, the character has difficulty identifying
themselves in the mirror, photos, surveillance feeds,
etc. They frequently forget the look and shape of their
current morph, acting inappropriately, describing
themselves by their original body, forgetting to duck
when walking through doorways, etc. This is primar-
ily a roleplaying trait, but the gamemaster may apply
appropriate modifiers (usually –10) to tests affected
by this inability to adapt.

ILLITERATE
Bonus: 10 CP
  The character knows how to speak, but has diffi-
culty reading or writing. Due to the entoptic-saturated
and icon-driven nature of transhuman society, they are
able to get by quite comfortably with this handicap.
Reduce the character’s Language skills by half (round
down) whenever reading or writing.

IMMORTALITY BLUES
Bonus: 10 CP
  The character has lived so long—over 100 years—
they’re bored with life and now have difficulty

%%% txt/152.txt
motivating themselves. They were old when longevity
treatments first became available, survived the Fall,
and continue to soldier onward—though they find
it increasingly harder to care, take interest in things
around them, or fear final death. The character only
receives half the Moxie and Rez Points award for
completing motivational goals.
   This trait may not be purchased by characters with
the infolife or uplift backgrounds.

IMPLANT REJECTION (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 5 (Level 1) or 15 (Level 2) CP
   This morph does not accept implants well. At Level
1, any implants acquired are more expensive as they
required specialized anti-rejection treatments. Increase
the Cost category of the implant by one. At Level 2,
the morph cannot accept implants of any kind.

INCOMPETENT
Bonus: 10 CP
  The character is completely incapable of perform-
ing a particular chosen active skill, no matter any
training they may receive. They may not buy this skill
during character creation or later advancement, and
the modifier for defaulting to the linked aptitude of
this particular skill is –10. This may not be used for
exotic weapon skills, and should be used for a skill
that could be of use to the character.

LEMON (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
  This trait is only available for synthetic morphs.
This particular morph has some unfixable flaws. Once
per game session (preferably at a time that will maxi-
mize drama or hilarity), the gamemaster can call for
the character to make a MOX x 10 Test (using their
current Moxie score). If the character fails, the morph
immediately suffers 1 wound resulting from some me-
chanical failure, electrical glitch, or other breakdown.
This wound may be repaired as normal.

LOW PAIN TOLERANCE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 20 CP
   Pain is the character’s enemy. The character has
a very low threshold for pain tolerance and is more
severely impaired when suffering. Increase the modi-
fier for each wound take by an additional –10 (so
the character suffers –20 with one wound, –40 with
another, and –60 with a third). Additionally, the
character suffers a –30 modifier on any test involving
pain resistance. This morph version of this trait is only
available for biomorphs.

MENTAL DISORDER
Bonus: 10 CP
  You have a psychological disorder from a previous
traumatic experience in your life. Choose one of the
disorders listed on p. 211.
MILD ALLERGY (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 5 CP
  The morph is allergic to a specific chosen allergen
(dust, dander, plant pollen, certain chemicals) and suf-
fers mild discomfort when exposed to it (eye irritation,
sneezing, difficult breathing). Apply a –10 modifier to
all tests while the character remains exposed. This
trait is only available for biomorphs.

MODIFIED BEHAVIOR
Bonus: 5 (Level 1), 10 (Level 2), or 20 (Level 3) CP
   The character has been conditioned via time-
accelerated behavioral control psychosurgery. This is
common among ex-felons, who have been conditioned
to respond to a specific idea or activity with vehement
horror and disgust, but may have occurred for some
other reason or even been self-inflicted. At Level 1, the
chosen behavior is either limited or boosted, at Level
2 it is either blocked or encouraged, and at Level 3 it
is expunged or enforced (see p. 231 for details). This
trait should only be allowed for behaviors that are
either limited or, if encouraged, impact the character
in a negative way.

MORPHING DISORDER
Cost: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP
  Adapting to new morphs is particularly challeng-
ing for this character. The character suffers a –10
modifier per level on Integration Tests and Alien-
ation Tests (p. 272).

NEURAL DAMAGE
Bonus: 10 CP
   The character has suffered some type of neurologi-
cal damage that simply cannot be cured. The affliction
is now part of the character’s ego and remains with
them even when remorphing. This damage may have
been inherited, it may have resulted from a poorly de-
signed morph or implant, or it may have been inflicted
by one of the TITAN nanovirii that targeted neural
systems during the Fall (p. 384). The gamemaster and
player should agree on a specific disorder appropriate
to their game. Some possibilities are:

 • Partial aphasia (difficulty communicating or
   using words)
 • Color blindness
 • Amusica (inability to make or understand music)
 • Synaesthesia
 • Logorrhoea (excessive use of words)
 • Loss of face recognition
 • Loss of depth perception (double range
   modifiers)
 • Repetitive behavior
 • Mood swings
 • The inability to shift attention quickly

  The gamemaster may decide to inflict modifiers
resulting from this affliction as appropriate.

%%% txt/153.txt
NO CORTICAL STACK (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
  The morph lacks the cortical stack that is common
to morphs of its type. This means the character cannot
be resleeved from the cortical stack if the character
dies, they can only be resleeved from a standard
backup. This trait is not available for flats.

OBLIVIOUS
Bonus: 10 CP
  The character is particularly oblivious to events
around them or anything other than what their at-
tention is focused on. They suffer a –10 modifier
to Surprise Tests and their modifier for being Dis-
tracted is –30 rather than the usual –20 (see Basic
Perception, p. 190).

ON THE RUN
Bonus: 10 CP
  The character is wanted by the authorities of a
particular habitat/station or faction, who continue to
actively search for the character. They either commit-
ted a crime or somehow displeased someone in power.
The character deals with that faction in question at
their own risk, and may occasionally be forced to deal
with bounty hunters.

PSI VULNERABILITY (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
  Something about the character’s mind makes
them particularly vulnerable to psi attack. They
suffer a –10 modifier when resisting such attacks.
The morph version of this trait may only be taken
by biomorphs.

REAL WORLD NAIVETÉ
Bonus: 10 CP
   Due to their background, the character has very
limited personal experience with the real (physical)
world—or they have spent so much time in simul-
space that their functioning in real life is impaired.
They lack an understanding of many physical proper-
ties, social cues, and other factors that people with
standard human upbringings take for granted. This
lack of common sense may lead the character to
misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret
someone’s body language.
   Once per game session, the gamemaster may in-
tentionally mislead the character when giving them
a description about some thing or some social in-
teraction. This falsehood represents the character’s
misunderstanding of the situation, and should be
roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes
the character’s mistake.
   This trait should only be available to characters
with the infolife or reinstantiated backgrounds,
though the gamemaster may allow it for characters
who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their
personal histories.
SEVERE ALLERGY (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 (uncommon) or 20 (common) CP
   The morph’s biochemistry suffers a severe allergic
reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into contact
(touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen.
The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen,
certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect
stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an
allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen,
the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breath-
ing (–30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR
Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory
failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied).
This trait is only available to biomorphs.

SLOW LEARNER
Bonus: 10 CP
  New skills are not easy for this character to pick
up. The character takes twice as long as normal to
improve skills or learn new ones (p. 152).

SOCIAL STIGMA (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
   An unfortunate aspect of the character’s back-
ground means that they suffer from a stigma in
certain social situations. They may be sleeved in
a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of
the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in
a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelli-
gence. In social situations where the character’s nature
is known to someone who view that nature with dis-
taste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a –10 to –30
modifier (gamemaster’s discretion) to social skill tests.

TIMID
Bonus: 10 CP
 This character frightens easily. They suffer a –10
modifier when resisting fear or intimidation.

UNATTRACTIVE (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)
   In a time when good looks are easily purchased,
this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness
is increasingly associated with being poor, backward,
or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good
looks range from distaste to horror. The character suf-
fers a –10 modifier on social tests for Level 1, –20 for
Level 2, and –30 for Level 3.
   Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modifier
does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or
those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This
modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but at
half the bonus, and it is only effective against char-
acters with that specific uplift background (i.e., neo-
avians, neo-hominids, etc.).

UNCANNY VALLEY (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
  There is a point where synthetic human looks
become uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but

%%% txt/154.txt
they remain just different enough that their looks
seem creepy or even repulsive—a phenomenon called
the “uncanny valley.” Morphs whose looks fall into
this range suffer a –10 modifier on social skill tests
when dealing with humans. This modifier does not
apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with
the infolife or uplift backgrounds.

UNFIT (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2)
  The morph is either not optimized for health and/or
just in bad shape. Reduce the aptitude maximums for
Coordination, Reflexes, and Somatics by 5 (Level 1 )
or 10 (Level 2).

VR VERTIGO
Bonus: 10 CP
   The character experiences intense vertigo and
nausea when interfacing with any type of virtual real-
ity, XP, or simulspace. Augmented reality has no effect,
but VR inflicts a –30 modifier to all of the character’s
actions. Prolonged use of VR (gamemaster’s discre-
tion) may actually incapacitate the character should
they fail a WIL x 2 Test.

WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP
   The morph’s immune system is susceptible to diseas-
 es, drugs, and toxins. At Level 1, apply a –10 modifier
whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects
of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modifier to
–20. This trait is only available to biomorphs.

ZERO-G NAUSEA (MORPH TRAIT)
Bonus: 10 CP
  This morph suffers from space sickness and does
not fair well in zero-gravity. The character suffers a
–10 modifier in any microgravity climate. Addition-
ally, whenever the character is first getting acclimated
or anytime they must endure excessive movement in
microgravity, they must make a WIL Test or spend 1
hour incapacitated by nausea per 10 points of MoF.



CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT
As characters accomplish goals and gather experience
during gameplay, they accumulate Rez Points (see
Awarding Rez Points, p. 384). Rez Points may be used
to improve the character’s skills, aptitudes, and other
characteristics per the following rules. The costs for
spending Rez Points for advancement are the same as
the costs for spending Customization Points.

CHANGING MOTIVATION
It is only natural that over time a character’s driving
goals and interests will change. The character may
reach a turning point where they feel certain personal
agendas have been fulfilled and it is time to move on,
or they have failed and need to be discarded. New
urgencies or philosophies may have entered the
character’s life, or the character may have become
disenchanted with particular memes and ideas they
previously took to heart.
   Changing a character’s motivation does not cost
Rez Points, but it is something that should only
happen in accordance with roleplaying and with
life-altering events. Players should not be allowed
to simply switch their motivations at whim, there
should be a driving reason or explanation for doing
so. For this reason, changing a motivation should only
happen when the player and gamemaster discuss the
matter and both agree that the swap is appropriate to
the character’s development and circumstances.
   If these conditions are met, the character simply
drops a previously held motivation and takes on a
new one. Only one motivation should be switched
out at a time.

SWITCHING MORPHS
Resleeving—switching from one morph to another—
is handled as an in-character interaction, not with Rez
Points. See Resleeving, p. 271.

IMPROVING APTITUDES
Aptitudes may be raised with Rez Points at the cost of
10 RP per aptitude point. This represents the charac-
ter’s improvement in their core characteristics, gained
from exercise, learning, and experience. Aptitudes may
not be raised above 30 (bonuses from morphs, im-
plants, traits, or other sources do not count towards
this total).
  Raising the value of an aptitude also raises the
value of all linked skills by an equivalent amount. If
this raises any linked skills over 60, an additional 1
RP must be spent per linked skill over 60.

IMPROVING SKILLS
Characters may also spend Rez Points to increase
existing skills or learn new ones. To improve an ex-
isting skill, the character must have successfully used
that skill in the recent past or must actively practice

S
 In a setting where physical looks and capabilities are
 easily changed at the push of a button, who you are and
 what you know is more important than any inborn abil-
 ity. Skills represent the knowledge your character has,
 the accumulated set of experience, education, and in-
 herent know-how possessed by each and every sentient
 transhuman in Eclipse Phase. They are what allow you
 to sneak into a hypercorp station, disable the security
 systems, hack the mesh hub, and then impersonate secu-
 rity personnel to make your escape. Your skills represent
 the one thing you have no matter what you look like or
 where you find yourself. When your characters explore
 what they can do, their skills, or lack thereof, often de-
 termine the margin between success and failure.
    Having a well-rounded set of skills is vital to survival
 and success in Eclipse Phase. The skills below encompass
 a wide selection of talents, enough so that each character
 can be unique in their abilities and knowledge.



 SKILLS OVERVIEW
 Skills are divided into aptitudes and learned skills (see
 Character Skills, p. 123). Most (but not all) learned
 skills are built on and linked to an aptitude. If a
 character lacks the specific skill needed in a situation,
 they may default to the linked aptitude. You may also
 choose to specialize in certain skills (see Specializa-
 tions, p. 123), reflecting an enhanced knowledge of a
 particular aspect of a certain skill.

 CORE SKILLS: APTITUDES
 Aptitudes represent inherent skills and abilities acquired
 at birth or during the course of growing up. Aptitudes
 are sometimes used for tests, but their primary use is
 determining the starting point at which learned skills
 are developed. Aptitudes determine the starting value
 of their linked skills. For example, a character with
 Somatics aptitude 10 who wishes to purchase points
 in the Freerunning skill (which is linked to Somatics)
 would start with a Freerunning rank of 10 and then
 buy additionally points in that skill.
   Aptitudes are also used when a character doesn’t
 posses knowledge of a needed skill (see Defaulting, p.
 116). Aptitudes represent the basic knowledge that a
 character has acquired regarding rudimentary use of that
 skill. They may not have ever received any formal train-
 ing with the skill, but they can still attempt to use it.
   Aptitudes range in value from 1 to 30, with 10 being
 the unaugmented human average and 15 representing
 the average of most genetically modified transhumans.
 Since aptitudes represent untrained ability, they are
 capped at a maximum rating of 30.
   There are seven different aptitudes that all players
 possess. These aptitudes are purchased during charac-
 ter creation (p. 128), but depending on the morph the

                                                                 6


 character is currently inhabiting, they may find their ap-
 titudes capped by the quality of the morph (see p. 124).

 LEARNED SKILLS
 A player’s learned skills are the most important part of
 their character, representing the acquired knowledge
 they carry with them from morph to morph, knowl-
 edge that plays a fundamental role in helping define
 the person’s ego. Learned skills encompass nearly any
 skill that you might need to use in Eclipse Phase, and
 they range in value from 0 to 99.
   All learned skills have a linked aptitude that is
 used to calculate their initial value, and which is
 also defaulted to if the player does not have that
 particular skill.

 SKILL CATEGORIES
 Each learned skill is classified as either an Active skill
 or a Knowledge skill. Active skills represent skills
 that typically require physical actions and are used in
 action scenes within game play. Knowledge skills are
 more knowledge-based and intellectual, representing
 ideas and facts. Knowledge skills may play a less dra-
 matic role in certain action-oriented game play mo-
 ments, but they flesh out the character’s background
 and interests and are integral to roleplaying interac-
 tions. Active and Knowledge skills are purchased
 separately during character creation.
   Active skills are further divided into Combat,
 Mental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle
 skills. Certain traits and abilities may apply to specific
 categories.

 FIELD SKILLS
 Some learned skills are field skills, meaning that when
 this skill is chosen a particular field of emphasis must
 also be selected. For example, the skill of Academics
 requires the character to specify a specific academic
 discipline in which they are knowledgeable, such as
 Biology, Chemistry, or Xenosociology. Field skills are
 written as “[skill]: [field];” for example: “Art: Paint-
 ing.” Field skills can be taken multiple times, choosing
 a different area of emphasis each time, reflecting skills
 in different fields; that is to say, each field is a separate
 skill. Several suggested fields are listed for each field
 skill, but gamemasters and players may also cooperate
 to create others that fit their games.
    Field skills may also have specializations; for exam-
 ple, Professional: Accounting (Money Laundering).

 PSI SKILLS
 Psi refers to the ability to perceive and manipulate
 biological minds via psi waves and/or other inexpli-
 cable phenomena. Due to the uniqueness of this ability,
 characters that wish to wield psi must acquire the Psi

%%% txt/175.txt
trait (p. 147). Psi use also requires a number of special-
ized skills (Control, Psi Assault, and Sense) that reflect
special training characters acquire to tap into their psi
powers. Psi skills may not be defaulted on; the only
way to use a psi skill is to possess the trait along with
training in that skill. For more details, see Psi, p. 220.

SPECIALIZATIONS
Any character may opt to specialize in a given skill
(see Specializations, p. 123). This specialization reflects
increased knowledge in one particular aspect of the
skill. Many of the skills offered below include sample
specializations. Gamemasters and players are encour-
aged to develop other specialization ideas together for
their campaigns.
   Specialization provides a +10 modifier when
using that skill in a situation appropriate to that
specialization.



USING SKILLS
Whenever a character wants to do something using
a skill, they must succeed at a skill test (see Making
Tests, p. 115). The difficulty of the action is applied
as a modifier, as are any other extenuating circum-
stances that may affect the test (see Difficulty and
Modifiers, p. 115). As with other types of tests, all skill
tests are successful when the character rolls less than
or equal to the test’s target number after any modi-
fiers have been applied. In the case of skill tests, the
target number is the character’s skill rating with that
particular skill. Modifiers representing difficulty and
other factors are applied directly to the target number
(see Difficulty and Modifiers, p. 115). A roll of a 00 is
always a success, regardless of modifiers, and a result
of 99 is always a failure, again despite any modifiers
that may increase a character’s target number over
100. Standard critical success and failure rules apply
to skill tests (see Criticals: Rolling Doubles, p. 116),
so any time a character rolls a double (i.e. 00, 11, 22,
33, etc.) they score a critical success or failure.

DEFAULTING
Sometimes you lack the skill needed in a certain situ-
ation. In these instances, characters may default their
skill test to the linked aptitude. This reflects the fact
that most learned skills are developed from some sort
of baseline physical ability. Even though you may not
know how to do something, you’ve likely seen how
it’s done at some point or have some idea of how to
do it, or can at least take a shot at it. Naturally, you’re
not as good as someone who has training in that skill,
but it still allows you to make an attempt.
   Not all skills can be defaulted. Some skills are
simply too complex or obscure, or demand special
knowledge or ability, for someone to attempt their
use untrained. For example, brain surgery or most psi
skills are simply beyond anyone who doesn’t have that
ability or the knowledge of what they’re attempting.
DEFAULTING TO FIELD SKILLS
In some cases, a character may not possess the par-
ticular field skill that a test calls for, but they may be
skilled in another related field. For example, a test to
conduct an alien autopsy might call for an Academics:
Xenobiology roll, but a character who doesn’t have
that skill may be allowed to default to Academics:
Biology instead. The gamemaster decides if and when
to allow this, perhaps applying a modifier to the test
based on the difference between fields.

DEFAULTING TO RELATED SKILLS
If the gamemaster allows it, characters may default to
a related skill that also has some relevance to the test
at hand. For example, a character skilled in Kinetic
Weapons might not be trained in the use of a laser, but
they know enough to point at the target and pull the
trigger. Likewise, a character might not be skilled in
Investigation, but the gamemaster could still allow
them to use their Perception skill instead in order to
realize that a body had been moved from the place
where it had been shot. In situations like this, when the
gamemaster allows defaulting to a related skill, a –30
modifier should be applied to the test.


  Srit is wandering through a black market souk on
  Mars, trying to find a particular piece of sensory
  equipment. The gamemaster calls for a Scrounging
                                                            EXAMPLE




  Test, but Srit does not have that skill. She could
  default her INT of 22, but instead she asks the
  gamemaster if she can default to the related skill
  of Perception, which she has at 82. The gamemas-
  ter agrees, and so Srit rolls against a target number
  of 52 (82 – 30).


COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS
Sometimes more than one skill may apply to a particu-
lar test, or knowledge in one area can aid your skill
in another. In this case, the gamemaster may apply a
modifier to the skill test based on the strength of the
complementing skill, as noted on the Complementary
Skill Bonus table.


  Dav is hoping to persuade a brinker pilot to take him
  to an isolated habitat that doesn’t welcome visitors.
  To impress upon the pilot that he is a friend of these
                                                            EXAMPLE




  particular isolates, he calls on his knowledge of their
  particular cultural practices (Interests: Religious
  Cults skill at 45). The gamemaster allows this and
  applies a +20 modifier to Dav’s Persuasion Test.

  SKILL RANGES
  What is the difference between being a clumsy neo-
  phyte wobbling in zero gravity and being a veteran
  gliding effortlessly through space as though you were
  dancing? The answer is training and skill. The greater
  your skill, the more likely you are to not only succeed
  at what you want to do, but succeed well.
    Aptitudes in Eclipse Phase range from 1 to 30,
  while learned skills range from 0 to 99. These num-
  bers are an abstraction of the range of transhuman
  abilities and traits. The Aptitude Range table provides
  a breakdown of different aptitude levels and how they
  relate to each other. Likewise, the Learned Skill Range
  table provides an interpretation for the capabilities at
  different skill levels.



  APTITUDES
  There are 7 aptitudes in Eclipse Phase, described on p.
  123. Each character has these aptitudes at a minimum
  rating of 1.

  APTITUDE-ONLY TESTS
  In rare cases, a test may call for using an aptitude
  only, rather than a learned skill. This should only
  occur when no learned skills are appropriate to the
  test, and these circumstances are usually noted in
  the rules.
    Aptitude-only tests must be handled carefully, as
  the range of aptitude ratings (1–30) is typically much
  smaller than the rating of learned skills (0–99). For
  this reason, most aptitude tests should use a target
  number equal to the aptitude x 3. In rare cases where

    99          Pinnacle of current understanding and innovation



   the test is more difficult, the gamemaster may simply
   use an aptitude x 2, or just the straight aptitude rating.
   In some cases, more than one aptitude may be rel-
   evant to the test, and so they may be added together
   to derive the target number.
     What follows are a few examples where an aptitude-
   only test might be appropriate. Gamemasters may call
   for similar tests in other situations, but learned skills
   should be used whenever possible.




EXALTS

 or exalts (p. 139) (well, those with biological bodies
 d optimized for certain characteristics, while exalts
ey are more attractive, more athletic, have greater
und them than their unaugmented kin.                 ■

%%% txt/177.txt
BRUTE STRENGTH
Any test that involves simple brute strength can be
handled as an SOM x 3 Test. Use this when smashing
down a door, breaking an item in half, engaging in a
tug-of-war, or lifting and carrying a heavy item.

CATCHING THROWN OBJECTS
Use REF + (COO x 2) any time you need to catch a
thrown or dropped object, such as catching a baseball,
saving a priceless vase from shattering, or throwing
back a grenade (see p. 200).

COMPOSURE AND RESOLVE
Various game situations may frighten your character,
turn their stomach, horrify them, or rattle them to the
core of their being. Use WIL x 3 to determine if your
character can hold their ground, keep it down, and
pull themselves together.

ESCAPE ARTIST
If a character wants to slip free of physical bonds (such
as ropes or handcuffs) or otherwise contort themselves
(such as wriggling out from under a collapsed wall or
an overturned vehicle), an Escape Artist Test may be
called for using the character’s COO + SOM. Apply
modifiers appropriate to the difficulty of the situation.
At the gamemaster’s discretion, escaping from some
restraining situations may be considered a Task Action
with an appropriate timeframe.

HAVING AN IDEA
Sometimes the players miss the obvious, or their per-
sonal mindset or biases cause them to misinterpret a
situation or understand events in a way different from
how the actual character would. In cases like this, the
gamemaster can call for an INT x 3 or COG x 3 roll
(whichever is more appropriate) to determine if the
character gets an idea that will help them along. This
test should be used sparingly, and only for assessing
the character’s interpretation of obvious and known
facts and details.

MEMORIZING AND REMEMBERING
Memories are what egos use to maintain continuity of
self from morph to morph, but humans are notorious
for remembering things incorrectly. Whenever char-
acters attempt to recall a memory or memorize some
piece of information, use COG x 3 to determine how
well they succeed. Note that characters with eidetic
memory (p. 146 or 301) or mnemonic augmentation
(p. 307) have perfect memory, so no test is required.

    COMPLETE SKILL LIST
   This section details all of the learned skills avail-
   able in Eclipse Phase. Gamemasters and players
   may, of course, agree to add additional skills to
   this list as appropriate to their campaign.

    ACADEMICS: [FIELD]
   Type: Field, Knowledge
   Linked Aptitude: COG
      What it is: Academics covers any sort of spe-
   cialized non-applied knowledge you can only get
   through intensive education. Most theoretical and
   applied sciences, social sciences, transhumanities,
   etc. are covered by this skill. Most of the other
   skills listed in this chapter could also be taken as
   an Academics field, reflecting a working theoretical
   knowledge of the skill—for example, Academics:
   Armorer or Academics: Interrogation.
      When you use it: Academics is used when a
   character wishes to call upon a specific body of
   knowledge. For example, Academics: Chemistry
   could be used to identify a particular substance,
   understand an unusual chemical reaction, or deter-
   mine what elements are needed to nanofabricate
   something that requires exotic materials. At the
   gamemaster’s discretion, some Academics-related
   tests might not be defaultable, given that only
   someone who has been educated in that subject is
   likely to be able to tackle it.
   Sample Fields: Archeology, Astrobiology, As-
      tronomy, Astrophysics, Astrosociology, Bio-
      chemistry, Biology, Botany, Computer Science,




NECESSARY SKILLS
While characters will need a mix of skills to
ucceed in the varied tasks they encounter in
 clipse Phase, some skills are crucial for any
haracter. If a character lacks these, they will
 ave a difficult time getting by, so it is impor-
ant for players and gamemasters to know
hese particular skills.
  Fray: Fray is the primary skill you use to avoid
 etting hit in combat. Even if you plan to avoid
ombat, being able to get out of the way when
 ecessary is a handy survival skill to have.
  Networking: Unless you live in total isolation,
ou need a Networking skill—preferably several.
 etworking is how you interact with people in
  particular social circle to obtain information,
pread rumors, call in favors, and so on.
  Perception: Perception Tests get called for
 uite often, so if you want your character to
 now what’s going on around them, make sure
o get this skill. Investigation and Scrounging
 re also good, but Perception is king.          ■

Specializations: As appropriate to the field

ANIMAL HANDLING
Type: Active, Social
 Linked Aptitude: SAV
   What it is: Skilled animal handlers are able to
 train and control a wide variety of natural and trans-
 genic animals, including partial uplifts. Though many
 animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few
“ark” and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and
 many others can be resurrected from genetic samples.
 Exotic animals are considered a sign of prestige
 among the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are
 occasionally used to protect high-security installations.
 Likewise, many habitats and settlements employ small
 armies of partially uplifted, genetically modified, and
 behavior-controlled creatures for sanitation or other
 purposes. Many new and strange breeds of animal are
 created daily to serve a variety of roles.
   When you use it: Animal Handling is used whenever
you are trying to manipulate an animal, whether your
 intent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking, in-
 timidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into attacking.
Your Margin of Success determines how effective you
 are at convincing the creature. At the gamemaster’s
 discretion, modifiers may be applied to the test. Like-
wise, winning an animal over may sometimes take
 time, and so could be handled as a Task Action with a
 timeframe of five minutes or more.
 Specializations: Per animal species (dogs, horses, smart
    rats, etc.)

TRAINING ANIMALS
Training animals is a time-consuming task requiring
repeated efforts and rewards to reinforce the trained
behavior. Treat this as a Task Action with a timeframe
of one day to one month, depending on the complex-
ity of the action. Apply modifiers to this test based on
the relative intelligence of the animal being trained,
how domestic it is, and the complexity of the task.
   Once an animal has been trained, commanding
it is treated as a Simple Success Test (p. 118) except
for unusual or stressful situations, in which case the
trainer receives a +30 modifier on their Animal Han-
dling Tests when convincing the animal to complete
the trained action.

ART: [FIELD]
Type: Field, Knowledge
Linked Aptitude: INT
  What it is: Art confers the ability to create and eval-
uate artistic endeavors. This is a particularly useful
skill in Eclipse Phase, especially in the post-scarcity
economies where creativity and vision can be a key
component to a character’s reputation.
  When you use it: The Art skill can be used to either
create a new work of art or to duplicate an existing
piece of art in the hopes of passing it off as your own.
The skill can also determine the approximate value of
a piece of art either on the open market, for monetary
exchange systems, or in terms of reputation for the
artist.
Sample Fields: Architecture, Criticism, Dance, Drama,
  Drawing, Painting, Performance, Sculpture, Simul-
  space Design, Singing, Speech, Writing
Specializations: As appropriate to the field

BEAM WEAPONS
Type: Active, Combat
Linked Aptitude: COO
What it is: The Beam Weapons skill covers the usage
and maintenance of standard coherent beam energy
weapons such as lasers, particle beam weapons,
plasma rifles, and microwave weapons (p. 338).
  When you use it: A player uses their Beam Weap-
ons skill whenever attacking with a beam weapon in
combat (p. 191). Beam Weapons may also be used for
tests involving maintenance of the weapon, but not
for repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
Hardware: Armorer skill).
Specializations: Lasers, Microwave Weapons, Particle
  Beam Weapons, Plasma Rifles

BLADES
Type: Active, Combat
Linked Aptitude: SOM
  What it is: The Blades skill covers the usage and
maintenance of standard bladed weapons (p. 334).
  When you use it: A player uses their Blades skill
whenever attacking with a blade weapon in melee
combat (p. 191). Blades may also be used for tests
involving maintenance of the weapon, but not for
repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
Hardware: Armorer skill). This skill is used for blade
weapons implanted in the body at the end of an ap-
pendage (hands, forearms, feet, octomorph arms, etc.),
but the Exotic Melee Weapon skill is used for blades
implanted in other parts of the body.
Specializations: Axes, Implant Blades, Knives, Swords

CLIMBING
Type: Active, Physical
Linked Aptitude: SOM
  What it is: Climbing is the skill of ascending and
descending sheer surfaces with or without the aid of
specialized equipment.
  When you use it: This skill is used whenever a char-
acter wishes to scale a climbable surface. For heights
greater than one story, climbing is handled as a Task
Action with a timeframe equivalent to one meter per
Action Phase. For rappelling, the timeframe for de-
scent is 50 meters per Action Turn. Climbing gear (p.
332-333) provides appropriate modifiers.
Specializations: Assisted, Freehand, Rappelling

%%% txt/180.txt
CLUBS
Type: Active, Combat
Linked Aptitude: SOM
  What it is: The Clubs skill covers the usage and
maintenance of standard blunt melee weapons such
as batons or sticks (see p. 334).
  When you use it: Players use their Clubs skill when-
ever they want to attack with a blunt weapon in melee
combat (p. 191). The Clubs skill may also be used for
tests involving maintenance of the weapon, but not
for repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
Hardware: Armorer skill).
Specializations: Batons, Hammers, Staffs

CONTROL
Type: Active, Mental, Psi
Linked Aptitude: WIL
  What it is: Control is the use of psi to manipulate
individuals or actively penetrate their mental pro-
cesses. This skill is only available to characters with
the Psi trait (p. 147).
  When you use it: Use Control when taking a psionic
tour through a foreign ego—messing around included.
See Psi, p. 220.
Specializations: By sleight

DECEPTION
Type: Active, Social
Linked Aptitude: SAV
  What it is: Deception is your ability to act, bluff,
con, fast talk, lie, misrepresent, and pretend. Accom-
plished users of deception are able to convince anyone
of nearly anything. This skill does not include using a
physical disguise to appear to be another person (the
Impersonate skill covers that area).
  When you use it: Use this skill whenever you want
to deceive someone with words or gestures. A success-
ful skill test means that you have passed off your de-
ception convincingly. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
someone who is actively alert for signs of deception
may make an Opposed Test using the Kinesics skill.
Specializations: Acting, Bluffing, Fast Talk

your appearance so that you look like someone else.
This includes both the use of props (wigs, contacts,
skin pigments) and the altering of subtle physical
characteristics (gait, posture, poise).
  When you use it: Use Disguise to fool someone into
thinking you’re someone you’re not. This can be used
to hide your identity or to make yourself look like
someone in particular. When used against someone
who knows your true look or the appearance of the
person you are imitating, this is handled as an Op-
posed Test against Perception or Investigation.
Specializations: Cosmetic, Theatrical

maneuvering jets and when parachuting.
Specializations: Microgravity, Parachuting, Vacsuits

FREERUNNING
Type: Active, Physical
Linked Aptitude: SOM
   What it is: Freerunning is part running, part gymnas-
tics. It is about moving fast, maneuvering over/under/
around/through obstacles, and placing your body
where it needs to go. Freerunning/parkour is a popular
pastime in habitats where open space is limited.
   When you use it: Use Freerunning whenever you
need to overcome an obstacle via movement, such
as hurdling a railing, rolling across the hood of a
car, jumping across a pit, or swinging around a pole.
Freerunning is also used for sprinting (p. 191) and full
defense against attacks (p. 198).
Specializations: Balance, Gymnastics, Jumping, Running

GUNNERY
Type: Active, Combat
Linked Aptitude: INT
  What it is: Gunnery skill covers the use and main-
tenance of large, vehicular, or non-portable weapons
systems. Firing these weapons is more like playing a
video game than firing a gun.
  When you use it: Use Gunnery when attacking with
a vehicle-mounted weapon or weapon emplacement
in ranged combat (p. 191).
Specializations: Artillery, Missiles
HARDWARE: [FIELD]
Type: Field, Active, Technical
Linked Aptitude: COG
  What it is: This skill encompasses the ability to
build, repair, physically hack, and upgrade equipment
of a specific type.
  When you use it: Hardware is primarily used to repair
devices, vehicles, habitat systems, or synthetic morphs.
See Building, Repairing, and Modifying below.
Sample Fields: Aerospace (all air and space vehicles),
  Armorer (armor and weapons), Electronics (all
  computerized devices), Groundcraft, Implants, In-
  dustrial (habitat, factory, and life support systems),
  Nautical (watercraft and submarines), Robotics
  (synthetic morphs)
Specializations: As appropriate to the field

BUILDING
Creating an item from scratch is handled as a Task
Action with a timeframe determined by the gamemas-
ter. The timeframe should be set according to the com-
plexity of the object and could range from an hour
(constructing a set of shelves) to days (assembling a
robot from spare parts) to even months (building a
house). Numerous factors may apply modifiers to
the test, such as the use of entoptic blueprints/help
manuals (+20) or poor working conditions (–10 to
–30). Tools are also a factor, perhaps making the job
 easier (superior tools +10 to +30), more difficult (poor
or inadequate tools, –10 to –30), or even impossible
(lack of required tools).

REPAIRING
Damaged items may be repaired in a similar manner. See
the rules for Synthmorph and Object Repair, p. 209.

MODIFYING
Altering an object’s design and function follows the
same basic rules as build and repair, above. The time-
frame is determined by the gamemaster as appropriate
to the modification.

%%% txt/182.txt
IMPERSONATION
Type: Active, Social
Linked Aptitude: SAV
  What it is: Impersonation is the skill of trying to
pass yourself off as someone else in social situations,
including virtual ones. This includes copying manner-
isms and speech patterns and using accumulated in-
formation to convince others that you are that person.
In a universe where appearance is highly variable, the
question of identity is largely one of both trust and
picking up on behavioral quirks and verbal cues to
recognize a given individual.
  When you use it: Sometimes it’s fun to pretend
you’re someone else, and sometimes it’s profitable
or lifesaving. Use this skill whenever you attempt
to convince someone that you are actually someone
else through some sort of social or online interaction.
Forks use this skill when passing themselves off as
their alpha ego. Impersonate is handled as an Op-
posed Test against the Kinesics skill.
Specializations: Avatar, Face-to-Face, Verbal

INFILTRATION
Type: Active, Physical
Linked Aptitude: COO
   What it is: Infiltration is the art of escaping
detection.
   When you use it: Use Infiltration whenever you
need to physically hide or move with stealth to avoid
someone sensing you, whether you are hiding behind
a tree, sneaking past a guard, or blending into a
crowd. Infiltration can also be used to follow people
(shadowing) without them detecting you. Infiltration
is an Opposed Test against the Perception of whom-
ever you are hiding from. The gamemaster may wish
to roll such tests in secret so the player does not know
whether they have succeeded or failed.
Specializations: Blending In, Hiding, Shadowing,
   Sneaking

INFOSEC
Type: Active, Technical
Linked Aptitude: COG (no defaulting)
   What it is: Infosec is short for “information secu-
rity.” It encompasses training in electronic intrusion
and counterintrusion techniques, as well as encryption
and decryption.

gram according to its normal operating parameters,
manipulate electronic files of various types (including
images, video, XP, and audio files), scan for wireless
devices, and otherwise interact with and command
your ecto, muse, and other computerized devices.
Some Interfacing actions may be Task Actions, with
a timeframe determined by the gamemaster. For more
detail, see the Mesh chapter, p. 234.
Specializations: Forgery, Scanning, Stealthing, by
   program

INTIMIDATION

do what you want based on direct threats (implied or
actual) or sheer force of personality.
  When you use it: Use Intimidation to scare someone
into submission, browbeat them into getting your way,
command them to follow your orders, or berate them
into giving up information. Influence is handled as an
Opposed Test, pitted against the target’s WIL + WIL
+ SAV.
Specializations: Interrogation, Physical, Verbal

INVESTIGATION
Type: Active, Mental
Linked Aptitude: INT
  What it is: Investigation is the art of analyzing
evidence, piecing together clues, solving mysteries,
and making logical deductions from groups of facts.
Investigation differs from Perception in that it is the
conscious search for clues or pieces of a puzzle.
  When you use it: Use Investigation to draw conclu-
sions from assorted details. For example, Investiga-
tion could be used to determine the likely sequence
of events at a crime scene, determine a possible social
connection between two people, or deduce how an
enemy made their escape. Investigation is a great way

%%% txt/183.txt
to provide clues to players, especially when the subject
matter is something their character might know well
but the player does not.
Specializations: Evidence Analysis, Logical Deductions,
  Physical Investigation, Physical Tracking

KINESICS
Type: Active, Social
Linked Aptitude: SAV
   What it is: Kinesics is the art of empathy and non-
vocal communication.
   When you use it: Use Kinesics to read body language,
tells, social cues, and other subconscious indicators. It
can also be used to emote more effectively. Kinesics
is used defensively whenever someone is trying to de-
ceive you; make an Opposed Test against that person’s
Deception or Impersonation skill.
   Though synthetic morphs are also designed to
emote, reading them is not as easy. Apply a –30 modi-
fier when judging a synthetic morph inhabited by a
character or AGI. Likewise, standard AIs are also dif-
ficult to read; apply a –60 modifier when judging a
synthetic morph or pod operated by an AI.
Specializations: Judge Intent, Nonvocal Communication

JUDGING EMOTIONS AND INTENTIONS
Transhumans are empathic beings, and so you can
attempt to gauge the demeanor and/or intent of
someone you are dealing with by rolling a Kinesics
Test. This attempt to read someone is far from exact,
however, and it is easy to misjudge. The gamemaster
should make this test in secret and only allow a hint
if successful—it is not possible to read someone with
absolute certainty. If the person being judged is inten-
tionally trying to deceive the character, this should be
an Opposed Test against their Deception skill.

NONVOCAL COMMUNICATION
Experts in Kinesics can effectively communicate
with each other simply by posture, stances, gestures,
demeanors, and looks. Such communication is nec-
essarily limited in the amount of information it can
convey, but feelings, attitudes, affirmation/negation,
and simple concepts may be passed. To effectively
communicate complex concepts, the gamemaster may
require successful Kinesics Tests from both parties, ap-
plying modifiers as appropriate.

KINETIC WEAPONS
Type: Active, Combat
Linked Aptitude: COO
   What it is: Kinetic Weapons covers the use and
maintenance of standard kinetic projectile weapons
like firearms and railguns (p. 335).

with a kinetic weapon in ranged combat (p. 191).
Specializations: Assault Rifles, Machine Guns, Pistols,
   Sniper Rifles, Submachine Guns
  LANGUAGES IN
  ECLIPSE PHASE
  With the Fall of Earth, the languages that
  remain most prominent in the solar system are
  those that were extensively carried into space
  by countries and hypercorps with aggressive
  space programs or by the large populations
  of poor laborers and infomorph refugees that
  followed. No single language dominated the
  realm of space expansion, and multilingual-
  ism was common. Many habitats and (sub)
  cultural groupings cling to specific languages
  as a method of retaining cultural identity. De-
  spite the availability of instant translation via
  the mesh, many people remain versed in two or
  more languages.
    The ten most common languages in the solar
  system by speaking populations are: Arabic,
  Cantonese, English, French, Hindi, Japanese,
  Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
  Other languages that remain strong include
  Bengali, Dutch, Farsi, German, Italian, Javanese,
  Korean, Polish, Punjabi, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish,
  Urdu, Vietnamese, and Wu. Some languages
  were effectively lost during the Fall, especially
  those in some undeveloped regions, as their
  speaking populations did not migrate into space
  pre-Fall and were not privileged enough to sur-
  vive in large numbers as infomorph refugees. ■



LANGUAGE: [FIELD]
Type: Field, Knowledge
Linked Aptitude: INT
  What it is: Language covers the speaking and
reading of languages other than the player’s native
tongue. A speaker is considered fluent at a skill level
of 50; anything above this indicates further refine-
ment in technical vocabulary, accents, and knowl-
edge of dialects.
  When you use it: Use the Language skill whenever
you want to speak, understand, or read something in
a language at which you are skilled. Most speaking
and reading comprehension tests can be considered
Simple Success Tests if your skill is over 50, unless the
gamemaster rules the subject is sufficiently complex
that a non-native speaker would have trouble under-
standing it.
Sample Fields: Arabic, Cantonese, English, French,
  Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian,
   Spanish
Specializations: As appropriate to the field, represent-
   ing dialects, technical jargon, and subcultural slang

PALMING
Type: Active, Physical
Linked Aptitude: COO
  What it is: Palming is the skill of handling items quick-
ly and nimbly without others noticing. Palming is not
only about dexterous manipulation of objects but also
relies heavily on obfuscation, timing, and misdirection.
  When you use it: Use Palming any time you are
trying to conceal an item on your person, shoplift,
pick a pocket, surreptitiously discard something, or
perform a magic trick. Palming is an Opposed Test
against the Perception of any onlookers. The game-
master may wish to make this roll secretly.
Specializations: Pickpocketing, Shoplifting, Tricks

PERCEPTION
Type: Active, Mental
Linked Aptitude: INT
  What it is: Perception is the use of your physical
senses (including cybernetic) and awareness of the
physical world around you. Perception differs from
Investigation in that it is noticing things by chance,
rather than actively searching for something.
  When you use it: Use Perception whenever you
wanted to take a detailed account of your surround-
ings (see Detailed Perception, p. 190). Perception
can also be considered an Automatic Action (see
Basic Perception, p. 190) and so the gamemaster may
call for a Perception Test to determine if you notice
something; it is recommended that such tests be rolled
secretly by the gamemaster. Perception is also used as
an Opposed Test whenever someone around you is
trying to be sneaky with Infiltration or Palming.
Specializations: Aural, Olfactory, Tactile, Taste, Visual

through threats or force (that is covered by Intimida-
tion) or by lying (covered by Deception).
  When you use it: Use Persuasion any time you are
trying to bargain with, convince, or manipulate some-
one. This can include motivating your subordinates or
peers to take action, seducing a companion, winning
a political debate, or negotiating a contract, among
other things. Persuasion is handled as an Opposed
Test against the target’s WIL + WIL + SAV when one
person is simply trying to win over another. If both
parties are trying to convince each other, make it an
Opposed Test between Persuasion skills.
Specializations: Diplomacy, Morale Boosting, Negoti-
   ating, Seduction

  Piracy, Simulspace Code

NANOFABRICATION
Nanofabrication is use of Programming skill to create
objects using a cornucopia machine, fabber, or maker
(p. 327). If you have appropriate blueprints and raw
materials, most uses of a nanofabricator can be treated
as a Simple Success Test (p. 118). If you wish to create
an item for which you do not have blueprints or the
proper raw materials, however, or you wish to alter an
item’s design, then a Nanofabrication Test is called for.
See Nanofabrication, p. 284.
Specializations: Art, Clothing, Electronics, Food, Forg-
   ery, Weapons

PROTOCOL
Type: Active, Social
Linked Aptitude: SAV

your grasp of customs, or otherwise fit into a specific
social/cultural grouping. Part etiquette, part streetwise,
Protocol allows you to navigate treacherous social
waters and put people at ease. If the character is deal-
ing with a suspicious or hostile audience, make this an
Opposed Test against the target’s WIL + WIL + SAV.
Specializations: Anarchist, Brinker, Criminal, Factor,
  Hypercorp, Infomorph, Mercurial, Reclaimer, Pres-
  ervationist, Scum, Ultimate

NEGATING SOCIAL GAFFES
Sometimes a player will make a mistake that their
character never would, whether that’s failing to stand
in the presence of hypercorp royalty, confusing a gang
leader for a peon, or accidentally insulting someone’s
heritage. In cases like this, the player may make a Pro-
tocol Test for the appropriate field in order to negate
the gaffe. If successful, the character never actually
screwed up, or at least managed to cover their tracks
without ruffling any feathers.

USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
t first glance, it may seem that Knowledge skills have
 wer in-game applications than Active skills. To some
egree this is the case. The importance of Knowledge
  ills, however, should not be underestimated. While
hey play a role in analyzing clues and solving myster-
 s, the real value of Knowledge skills is in helping the
haracters—and the players—understand the world of
clipse Phase. In particular these skills can be used to
 ake plans, assess a situation, identify strengths and
 eaknesses, evaluate worth, make comparisons, forecast
robable outcomes, or understand the applicable science,
ocio-economic factors, or cultural or historical context.
  For example, a group of characters looking to break
 to a facility could use Profession: Security Procedures
o evaluate the defenses, Academic: Architecture to
 entify covert points of entry, Interests: Sports to plan
  eir infiltration at a time when the guards are likely to
e distracted, Interests: Triads to identify a local crime
roup that can sell them breaking and entering gear,
nd Art: Sculpture when picking a valuable art piece
 ith which to bribe an insider. When used appropriately,
hese skills can be just as beneficial as the Active skills
sed to break inside, if not more so because the plan
 more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation.
  It is largely up to the gamemaster to enforce how
seful Knowledge skills are in their game. The easiest
 ay to reinforce their relevance is to penalize charac-
 rs who don’t take advantage of them. For example,
haracters who didn’t use their Profession: Security
  ocedures in the example above might end up being
urprised when they run across a security system they
 e not prepared to deal with, forcing them to impro-
 se or even abandon their plans.                         ■

 ECIAL SKILLS
 hile the preceding list represents the skills most commonly
  in Eclipse Phase, there may be certain skills called for in a
paign that are not found in this book. In this case, the game-
ter may work with the players to create a new skill to fill
void. This option should be used sparingly to prevent skill
t, and all skills are subject to approval by the gamemaster
you choose to create a new skill, keep in mind that it needs
e linked to an existing aptitude and should be a skill that
 ailable to all characters, not just specific to one character.

AND COMBAT■ACTION AND COMBAT■



N AND COMBAT
Roleplaying games are about creating drama and
adventure, and that usually means action and
combat. Action and combat scenes are the moments
when the adrenaline really gets pumping and the
characters’ lives and missions are on the line.
  Combat and action scenarios can be confusing
to run, especially if the gamemaster also needs to
keep track of the actions of numerous NPCs. For
these reasons, it’s important for the gamemaster to
detail the action in a way that everyone can visual-
ize, whether that means using a map and miniatures,
software, a dry-erase board, or quick sketches on
a piece of paper. Though many of the rules for
handling action and combat are abstract—allowing
room for interpretation and fudging results to fit
the story—many tactical factors are also incorpo-
rated, so even small details can make a large differ-
ence. It also helps to have the capabilities of NPCs
predetermined and to run them as a group when
possible, to reduce the gamemaster’s burden in the
middle of a hectic situation.



 ACTION TURNS
Action scenes in Eclipse Phase are handled in bite-
size chunks called Action Turns, each approximately
3 seconds in length. We say “approximately” be-
cause the methodical, step-by-step system used to
resolve actions does not necessarily always translate
realistically to real life, where people often pause,
take breaks to assess the situation, take a breather,
and so on. A combat that begins and ends within 5
Action Turns (15 seconds) in Eclipse Phase could
last half a minute to several minutes in real life. On
the other hand, the characters may be in a situation
where their breathing environment decompresses to
vacuum in 15 seconds, so every second may in fact
count. As a rule, gamemasters should stick with 3
seconds per turn, but they shouldn’t be afraid to
fudge the timing either when a situation calls for it.
  Action Turns are meant to be utilized for combat
and other situations where timing and the order in
which people act is important. If it is not necessary
to keep track of who’s doing what so minutely, you
can drop out of Action Turns and return to “regu-
lar” free form game time.
   Each Action Turn is in turn broken down into
distinct stages, described below.

 STEP 1: ROLL INITIATIVE
At the beginning of every Action Turn, each PLAYER
involved in the scene rolls Initiative to determine the
order in which each character acts. For more details,
see Initiative.
CTION AND COMBAT■ACTION AND CO

                                                           7


 STEP 2: BEGIN FIRST ACTION PHASE
 Once Initiative is rolled, the fi rst Action Phase
 begins. Everyone gets to act in the first Action Phase
 (since everyone has a minimum Speed of 1), unless
 they happen to be unconscious/dead/disabled, start-
 ing with the character with the highest successful
 Initiative roll.

 STEP 3: DECLARE AND RESOLVE ACTIONS
 The character going first now declares and resolves
 the actions they will take during this first Action
 Phase. Since some actions the character makes may
 depend on the outcome of others, there is no need
 to declare them all first—they may be announced
 and handled one at a time.
   As described under Actions (p. 189), each charac-
 ter may perform a varying number of Quick Actions
 and/or a single Complex Action during their turn.
 Alternately, a character may begin or continue with
 a Task Action, or delay their action pending other
 developments (see Delayed Actions, p. 189).
   A character who has delayed their action may
 interrupt another character at any point during this
 stage. That interrupting character must complete
 this stage in full, then the action returns to the in-
 terrupted character to finish the rest of their stage.

 STEP 4: ROTATE AND REPEAT
 Once the character has resolved their actions for
 that phase, the next character in the Initiative order
 gets to go, running through Step 3 for themselves.
    If every character has completed their actions
 for that phase, return to Step 2 and go the second
 Action Phase. Every character with a Speed of 2 or
 more gets to go through Step 3 again, in the same
 Initiative order (modified by wound modifiers).
 Once the second Action Phase is completed, return
 to Step 2 for the 3rd Action Phase, where every
 character with a Speed of 3 or more gets to go for
 a third time. Finally, after everyone eligible to go in
 the 3rd Action Phase has gone, return to Step 2 for
 a fourth and last Action Phase, where every charac-
 ter with a Speed of 4 can act for one final time.
   At the end of the fourth Action Phase, return to Step
 1 and roll Initiative again for the next Action Turn.



 INITIATIVE
 Timing in an Action Turn can be critical—it may mean
 life or death for a character who needs to get behind
 cover before an opponent draws and fires their gun.
 The process of rolling Initiative determines if a char-
 acter acts before or after another character.

%%% txt/191.txt
INITIATIVE ORDER
A character’s Initiative stat is equal to their Intuition +
Reflexes aptitudes multiplied by 2. This score may be
further modified by morph type, implants, drugs, psi,
or wounds.
  In the first step of each Action Turn, every charac-
ter makes an Initiative Test, rolling d100 and adding
their Initiative stat. Whoever rolls highest goes first,
followed by the other characters in descending order,
highest to lowest. In the event of a tie, characters go
simultaneously.


           Adam, Bob, and Cami are rolling Initiative. Adam’s
           Initiative stat is 80, Bob’s is 110, and Cami’s is 60.
           Adam rolls a 38, Bob rolls a 24, and Cami rolls a
 EXAMPLE




           76. Adam’s total Initiative score is 118 (80 + 38),
           Bob’s is 134 (110 + 24), and Cami’s is 136 (60 +
           76). Cami rolled highest, so she goes first, followed
           by Bob and then Adam. If Cami & Bob had tied,
           they would both go at the same time.


INITIATIVE AND DAMAGE
Characters who are suffering from wounds have their
Initiative score temporarily reduced (see Wounds, p.
207). This modifier is applied immediately when the
wound is taken, which means that it may modify an
Initiative score in the middle of an Action Turn. If a
character is wounded before they go in that Action
Phase, their Initiative is reduced accordingly, which
may mean they now go after someone they were pre-
viously ahead of in the Initiative order.


           Before Bob’s Action Phase comes up, Bob takes
 EXAMPLE




           two wounds, knocking his Initiative down from
           134 to 114. This means that Adam, with an Initia-
           tive of 118, now goes before him.


INITIATIVE, MOXIE, AND CRITICALS
A character may spend a point of Moxie to go first in
an Action Phase, regardless of their Initiative roll (see
Moxie, p. 122). If more than one character chooses
this option, then order is determined as normal first
among those who spent Moxie, followed by those
who didn’t.
   Similarly, any character that rolls a critical on Ini-
tiative automatically goes first, even before someone
who spent Moxie. If more that two characters rolled
criticals, determine order between them as normal.

SPEED
Speed determines how many times a character can
act during an Action turn. Every character starts with
a default Speed stat of 1, meaning they can act in the
first Action Phase of the turn only. Certain morphs,
implants, drugs, psi, and other factors may cumu-
latively increase their Speed to 2, 3, or even 4 (the
maximum), allowing them to act in further Action
  SIMPLIFYING
  INITIATIVE
  For speedier resolution, simply have characters
  roll Initiative once for an entire scene. That
  Initiative result stays with them on each Action
  Turn until the combat or scenario is over. Like-
  wise, ignore Initiative modifiers from wounds. ■




Phases as well. For example, a character with Speed
2 can act in the first and second Action Phases, and
a character with Speed 3 can act in the first through
third Action Phases. A character with Speed 4 is
able to act in every Action Phase. This represents
the character’s enhanced reflexes and neurology, al-
lowing them to think and act much faster than non-
enhanced characters.
  If a character’s Speed does not allow them to act
during an Action Phase, they can initiate no actions
during the pass—they must simply bide their time.
The character may still defend themself, however, and
any automatic actions remain “on.” Note that any
movement the character initiated is considered to still
be underway even during the Action Phases they do
not participate in (see Movement, p. 190).

DELAYED ACTIONS
When it’s your turn to go during an Action Phase,
you may decide that you’re not ready to act yet. You
may be awaiting the outcome of another character’s
actions, hoping to interrupt someone else’s action, or
may simply be undecided about what to do yet. In this
case, you may opt to delay your action.
  When you delay your action, you’re putting your-
self on standby. At some later point in that Action
Phase, you can announce that you are now taking
your action—even if you interrupt another character’s
action. In this case, all other activity is put on hold
until your action is resolved. Once your action has
taken place, the Initiative order continues on where
you interrupted.
  You may delay your action into the next Action
Phase, or even the next Action Turn, but if you do not
take it by the time your next action comes around in
the Initiative order, then you lose it. Additionally, if
you do delay your action into another phase or turn,
then once you take it you lose any action you might
have in that Action Phase.



ACTIONS
When it’s your turn to act during an Action Phase,
you have many options for what you can do—far too
many to list here. There is a limit to what you can
accomplish in 3 seconds, however, so some limita-
tions must be adhered to. The first step is to figure

%%% txt/192.txt
out what type of action you want to take. In Eclipse
Phase, actions are categorized as Automatic, Quick,
Complex, or Task, based on how much time and
effort they entail.

AUTOMATIC ACTIONS
Automatic Actions require no effort. These are abili-
ties or activities that are “always on” (assuming you
are conscious) or are otherwise reflexive (they happen
automatically in response to certain conditions, with
no effort from you). Breathing, for example, is an au-
tomatic action—your body does it without conscious
effort or thinking on your part.
   In most cases, Automatic Actions are not something
that you initiate—they are always active, or at least
on standby. Certain circumstances, however, will bring
an Automatic Action to bear. Such Automatic Actions
are invoked and handled immediately whenever they
apply, without requiring effort from your character.

RESISTANCE
Resisting damage—whether from combat, a poison, or
a psi attack—is one example of an Automatic Action
that occurs in response to something else.

BASIC PERCEPTION
Your senses are continuously active, accumulating data
on the world around you. Basic perception is consid-
ered an Automatic Action, and so the gamemaster can
call on you to make a Perception Test whenever you
receive sensory input that your brain might want to
take notice of (see Perception, p. 182). Likewise, you
may ask the gamemaster at any time—even during
other character’s actions—to make a basic Perception
Test, just to find out what your character is noticing
around them.
  Because basic perception is an automatic, subcon-
scious activity, however, you will suffer a –20 modifier
for distraction—your attention is focused elsewhere.
In order to avoid the distraction modifier, you must
actively engage in detailed perception or use an oracle
implant (p. 308).

QUICK ACTIONS
Quick Actions are fast and simple, and they may often
be multi-tasked. They require minimal thought and
effort. You may undertake multiple Quick Actions on
your turn during each Action Phase, limited only by
the gamemaster’s judgment. If you are taking noth-
ing but Quick Actions during an Action Phase, you
should be allowed a minimum of 3 separate Quick
Actions. If you are also engaging in a Complex or Task
Action during that same Action Phase, you should be
allowed a minimum of 1 Quick Action. Ultimately, the
gamemaster decides what activity you can or can’t fit
into a single Action Phase.
   Some examples of Quick Actions include: talking,
switching a safety, activating an implant, standing
up, dropping prone, gesturing, drawing/readying a
weapon, handling an object, or using a simple object.
AIMING
Aiming is a special case in that it is a Quick Action
but requires a degree of concentration that rules out
other minor actions. If you wish to aim before making
an attack in the same Action Phase, aiming is the only
Quick Action you may make during that Action Phase
(see Aimed Shots, p. 193).

DETAILED PERCEPTION
Detailed perception involves taking a moment to
actively use your senses in search of information and
assess what you are perceiving (see Perception, p.
182). It requires slightly more effort and brainpower
(or computer power) than basic perception, which is
automatic. As a Quick Action, you may only engage
in detailed perception on your turn during an Action
Phase, but you do not suffer a modifier for distrac-
tion (unless you happen to be in a heavily distracting
environment, such as a gunfight or agitated crowd).

COMPLEX ACTIONS
Complex Actions require more concentration and
effort than Quick Actions—they effectively monopo-
lize your attention. You may only take one Complex
Action on each your Action Phase turns. Additionally,
you may not engage in a Complex Action and a Task
Action during the same Action Phase.
   Examples of Complex Actions include: attacking,
shooting, acrobatics, full defense, disarming a bomb,
using a complex device, or reloading a weapon.

TASK ACTIONS
A Task Action is any activity that requires longer than one
Action Turn to complete. Each Task Action lists a time-
frame for how long the task takes to accomplish. This
timeframe may range anywhere from 2 Action Turns to 2
years. While engaged in a Task Action, you may not also
undertake a Complex Action, though in some cases you
may take a break from the task and return to it later. For
more information, see Task Actions, p. 120.
   Examples of Task Actions include: repairing a
device, programming, conducting a scientific analysis,
searching a room, climbing a wall, or cooking a meal.



MOVEMENT
Movement in Eclipse Phase is handled just like any
other action, and may change from Action Phase to
Action Phase. Walking and running both count as Quick
Actions, as they do not require your full concentration.
The same also applies to slithering, crawling, floating,
hovering, or gliding. Running, however, may inflict a
–10 modifier on other actions that are affected by your
jostling movement. Even more, sprinting is an all-out run,
 and so requires a Complex Action (see Sprinting, p. 191).
   At the gamemasters discretion, other movement
 may also call for a Complex Action. Hurdling a fence,
pole vaulting, jumping from a height, swimming, or
freerunning through a habitat in zero-gravity all re-
quire a bit of finesse and attention to detail, so would

%%% txt/193.txt
count as a Complex Action, and would apply the
same modifier as running. Flying generally counts as a
Quick Action, though intricate maneuvers would call
for a Complex Action.

MOVEMENT RATES
Sometimes it’s important to know not just how you’re
moving, but how far. For most of transhumanity, this
movement rate is the same: 4 meters per Action Turn
walking, 20 meters per turn running. To determine
how far a character can move in a particular Action
Phase, divide this movement rate by the total number
of Action Phases in that turn. In a turn with 4 Action
Phases, that breaks down to 1 meter walking per
Action Phase, 5 meters running.
  Movement such as swimming or crawling bench-
marks at about 1 meter per Action Turn, or 0.25
meters per Action Phase. You can also sprint to in-
crease your movement rate (see Sprinting). Vehicles,
robots, creatures, and unusual morphs will have indi-
vidual movement rates listed in the format of walking
rate/running rate in meters per turn.
  These movement rates assume standard Earth
gravity of course. If you’re moving in a low-gravity,
microgravity, or high-gravity environment, things
change. See Gravity, p. 198.

JUMPING
Characters making a running jump can cross SOM ÷
5 (round up) meters; use SOM ÷ 20 (round up) meters
for standing jumps. Vertical jumping height is 1 meter.
Characters making a Freerunning Test can increase
jumping distance by 1 meter (running jump) or 0.25
meters (standing/vertical jumps) per 10 points of MoS.

SPRINTING
You may use Freerunning to increase the distance
you move during an Action Phase. You must spend
a Complex Action to sprint and make a Freerunning
Test. Every 10 points of MoS increases your running
distance in that Action Phase by 1 meter, to a maxi-
mum bonus of +5 meters.
COMBAT
Sometimes words fail, and that’s when the knives and
shredders come out. All combat in Eclipse Phase is
conducted using the same basic mechanics, whether it’s
conducted with claws, fists, weapons, guns, or psi: an
Opposed Test between the attacker and defender(s).

RESOLVING COMBAT
Use the following sequence of steps to determine the
outcome of an attack.

STEP 1: DECLARE ATTACK
The attacker initiates by taking a Complex Action to
attack on their turn during an Action Phase. The skill
employed depends on the method used to attack. If
the character lacks the appropriate Combat skill, they
must default to the appropriate linked aptitude.

STEP 2: DECLARE DEFENSE
Once the attack is declared, the defender chooses how
to respond. Defense is always considered an Automatic
Action unless the defender is surprised (see Surprise,
p. 204) or somehow incapacitated and incapable of
defending themself.
   Melee: A character defending against melee at-
tacks uses Fray skill, representing dodging (if the
character lacks this skill, they may default to Re-
flexes). Alternately, the character may use a melee
combat skill to defend, representing blocks and par-
ries rather than dodging.
   Ranged: Against ranged attacks, a defending char-
acter may only use half their Fray skill (round down).
   Full Defense: Characters who have taken a Com-
plex Action to go on full defense (p. 198) receive a
+30 modifier to their defensive roll.
   Psi: A character defending against a psi attack rolls
WIL x 2 (p. 222). A mental sort of full defense may
also be rallied against psi attacks.

%%% txt/194.txt
STEP 3: APPLY MODIFIERS
Any appropriate modifiers are now applied to the
attacker and defender’s skills. See the Combat Modi-
fiers table (p. 193) for common situational modifiers.

STEP 4: MAKE THE OPPOSED TEST
The attacker and defender both roll d100 and com-
pare the results to their modified skill target numbers.

STEP 5: DETERMINE OUTCOME
If the attacker succeeds and the defender fails, the
attack hits. If the defender succeeds but the at-
tacker fails, the attack misses completely.
   If both attacker and defender succeed in their
tests, compare their dice rolls. If the attacker’s
dice roll is higher, the attack hits despite a spirited
defense; otherwise, the attack fails to connect.
   Excellent Success: If the attacker rolled an Ex-
cellent Success (MoS of 30+), a solid hit is struck.
Increase the Damage Value (DV) inflicted by +5. If
the MoS is 60+, increase the DV by +10.
   Criticals: If the attacker rolls a critical success,
the attack is armor-defeating, meaning that the
defender’s armor is bypassed completely—some
kink or flaw was exploited, allowing the attack to
get through completely.
   If the defender rolls a critical success, the attack-
er’s weapon breaks, jams, gets stuck somewhere,
or otherwise malfunctions or gets dropped.

STEP 6: MODIFY ARMOR
If the target is hit, their armor will help to pro-
tect them against the attack (unless the attacker
rolled a critical, see above). Determine which type
of armor is appropriate to defending against that
particular attack (see Armor, p. 194). The attack’s
Armor Penetration (AP) value reduces the armor’s
rating, however, representing the weapon’s ability
to pierce through protective measures.

STEP 7: DETERMINE DAMAGE
Every weapon and type of attack has a Damage
Value (DV, see p. 207). This amount is reduced
by the target’s AP-modified armor rating. If the
damage is reduced to 0 or less, the armor is ef-
fective and the attack fails to injure the target.
Otherwise, any remaining damage is applied to the
defender. If the accumulated damage exceeds the
defender’s Durability, they are incapacitated and
may die (see Durability and Health, p. 207).
  Note that some psi attacks inflict mental stress
rather than physical damage (see Mental Health, p.
209). In this case, the Stress Value (SV) is handled
the same as DV.

STEP 8: DETERMINE WOUNDS
The damage inflicted from a single attack is then
compared to the victim’s Wound Threshold. If
the armor-modified DV equals or exceeds the
Wound Threshold, the character suffers a wound.
Multiple wounds may be applied with a single attack
if the modified DV is two or more factors beyond the
Wound Threshold. Wounds represent more serious
injuries and apply modifiers and other effects to the
character (see Wounds, p. 207).


  Stoya tried to get off the station quickly, but the Night
  Cartel’s assassin caught up, surprising her in a micro-
  gravity part of the habitat. The assassin’s INIT is 63,
  plus a dice roll of 23, for an Initiative of 86. Stoya’s
  INIT is 55, plus a roll of 27, for an Initiative of 82.
     The assassin goes first, spending a Quick Action
  to draw a shredder. This ﬂechette weapon is in
  burst-fire mode, so with a Complex Action the as-
  sassin can take two shots. His Spray Weapons skill
  is 65, he’s smartlinked (+10), and they’re at short
  range (+0), so he needs a 75 or less. Stoya is de-
  fending with her Fray skill (60) divided by 2, or 30.
     The assassin rolls an 08 with the first shot. Amaz-
  ingly, Stoya rolls a 28. They both succeeded, but
  Stoya rolled higher, so she dodges the first shot.
     The assassin rolls a 20 for his second shot, an-
  other hit, and this time Stoya rolls an 83, a failure.
  The assassin also scored an Excellent Success with
  a MoS of 55, increasing the DV by +5.
     The assassin’s base damage is 2d10 + 5, but he’s
  using burst fire against a single target for +1d10,
  and it’s also a cone effect weapon at short range,
  for an additional +1d10, for a total DV of 4d10 +
  5. The assassin rolls 4d10 and gets 16, then adds
  the +5 for a total DV of 21.
     Stoya’s wearing light body armor (AV 10/10),
                                                              EXAMPLE




  but the shredder’s Armor penetration is –10, so her
  armor is entirely negated. She takes a devastating 21
  DV, exceeding her Wound Threshold of 10, not just
  once, but twice. This means Stoya suffers 2 wounds
  from the shot, suffering –20 to all actions. In addi-
  tion, she must make two SOM x 3 Tests, one to avoid
  knockdown and the other to avoid unconsciousness.
  Her SOM is 30, meaning she needs a 70 (30 x 3 =
  90, 90 – 20 wound modifiers = 70) on both rolls.
  She rolls a 40 and a 27, succeeding both.
     Now it’s Stoya’s action. She takes a Quick Action
  to pull her own weapon: a stunner. Her Beam
  Weapons skill is 47, modified by wounds (–20) and
  a smartlink (+10), for 37. The assassin’s Fray is 48,
  divided by 2 for 24 against a ranged attack. Stoya
  rolls a 22—a critical hit—and the assassin rolls a
  68. The stunner only inﬂicts 1d10 ÷ 2 DV, but since
  the attack is a critical hit, this is armor defeating.
  Stoya rolls an 8, for 4 points of DV, below the as-
  sassin’s Wound Threshold of 7.
     Stunners, however, are shock weapons, so the
  assassin must make a DUR + Energy Armor Test.
  His DUR is 35 and he’s wearing an armor vest (AV
  6/6), so his target number is 41. He rolls a 71—a
  Margin of Failure of 30, meaning he is immediately
  incapacitated for 3 Action Turns.
     Having disabled her opponent, Stoya takes the
  time to make a hasty getaway.

COMBAT SUMMARY
• Combat is handled as an Opposed Test.
• Attacker rolls attack skill +/– modifiers.
• Melee: Defender rolls Fray or melee skill
  +/– modifiers.
• Ranged: Defender rolls (Fray skill ÷ 2, round
  down) +/– modifiers.
• If attacker succeeds and rolls higher than the
  defender, the attack hits.
• Critical hits are armor-defeating (armor does
  not apply).
• Armor is reduced by the attack’s Armor
  Penetration value (AP).
• The weapon’s damage is reduced by the
  target’s modified Armor rating (unless the
  attack is armor-defeating).
• If the damage exceeds the target’s Wound
  Threshold, a wound is also scored. (If the
  damage exceeds the Wound Threshold
  by multiple factors, multiple wounds are
  inﬂicted.)



ACTION AND COMBAT COMPLICATIONS
Combat isn’t quite as simple as deciding if you hit or
miss. Weapons, armor, ammunition, and numerous
other factors may impact an attack’s outcome. Like-
wise, various factors can impact an action scene, such
as fire or microgravity effects.

AIMED SHOTS
As noted under Aiming, p. 190, a character can sacri-
fice their other Quick Actions to concentrate on tar-
geting a ranged attack and receive a +10 modifier on
the attack. You can also sacrifice an entire Complex
Action to fix your aim on a target. In this case, as long
as the target remains in your sights until your next
Action Phase, you receive a +30 modifier to hit.

AMMUNITION AND RELOADING
Every weapon has a listed ammunition capacity that
indicates how many shots the weapon can carry or
holds. When this ammo runs out, a new supply must
be loaded in. Players should keep track of the shots
they fire.
   Reloading almost always requires a Complex
Action, whether you are slapping in a new clip of bul-
lets or a fresh battery for a laser. At the gamemaster’s
discretion, a reload that is immediately accessible
(such as a new clip reverse-taped to the loaded clip, so
that reloading just requires that you reverse the taped
clips and slot the new one in) will only take a Quick
Action. Archaic weapons such as magazine-fed rifles
may require longer to fully load.

AREA EFFECT WEAPONS
Some ranged attack weapons are designed to affect
more than one target at a time. These weapons fall
into three categories: blast, uniform blast, and cone.

 BLAST EFFECT
 Blast weapons include items like grenades, mines, and
 other explosives that expand outward from a central
 detonation point. Most blast attacks expand outward
 in a sphere, though certain shaped charges may direct
 an explosion in one direction only. The explosive force
 is stronger near the epicenter and weaker near the
 outer edges of the sphere. For every meter a target is
 from the center, reduce the damage of a blast weapon
 by –2.

%%% txt/196.txt
UNIFORM BLAST
Uniform blast attacks distribute their power evenly
throughout the area of effect. Examples include fuel-
air explosives and thermobaric weapons that disperse
an explosive mixture in a vapor cloud and ignite it all
at once. All targets within the noted blast radius suffer
the same damage. Damage against targets outside of
the main blast sphere is reduced by –2 per meter.

CONE
Weapons with a cone effect have an area effect that
begins with the tip of the weapon and expands out-
ward in a cone. At short range, this attack effects 1
target; at medium range it affects 2 targets within a
meter of each other; and at long or extreme range
it affects 3 targets within a meter of the next. Cone
 effect attacks do +1d10 damage at short range and
–1d10 damage at long and extreme range.

ARMOR
Just as weapons technologies have advanced, so too
has armor quality, allowing unprecedented levels of
protection. As noted in Step 7: Determine Damage
(see p. 192), the armor rating reduces the damage
points of the attack.
   For a full listing of armor types and values, see p.
311.

ENERGY VS. KINETIC
Each type of armor has an Armor value (AV) with two
ratings—Energy and Kinetic—representing the protec-
tion it applies against the respective type of attack.
These are listed in the format of “Energy armor/Kinetic
armor.” For example, an item with listed armor “5/10”
provides 5 points of armor against energy-based at-
tacks and 10 points of armor against kinetic attacks.
   Energy damage includes that caused by beam weap-
ons (laser, microwave, particle beam, plasma, etc.) as
well as fire and high-energy explosives. Armor that
protects against this damage is made of material that
reflects or diffuses such energy, dissipates and trans-
fers heat, or ablates.
   Kinetic damage is the transfer of damaging energy
when an object in motion (a fist, knife, club, or bullet,
for example) impacts with another object (the target).
Most melee and firearms attacks inflict kinetic damage,
as would a rolling boulder, swinging pendulum, or
explosion-driven fragments. Kinetic armors include
impact-resistant plates, shear-thickening liquid and
gels that harden upon impact, and ballistic and cut-
proof fiber weaves.

ARMOR PENETRATION
Some weapons have an Armor Penetration (AP) rating.
This represents the attack’s ability to pierce through
protective layers. The AP rating reduces the value of
armor used to defend against the attack (see Step 6:
Modify Armor, p. 192).
LAYERED ARMOR
If two or more types of armor are worn, the armor
ratings are added together. However, wearing multiple
armor units is cumbersome and annoying. Apply a –20
modifier to a character’s actions for each additional
armor layer worn
   Note that items specifically noted as armor accesso-
ries—helmets, shields, etc.—do not inflict the layered
armor penalty, they simply add their armor bonus.
Note also that the armor inherent to a synthetic
morph or bot’s frame does not constitute a layer of
armor (i.e., you may wear armor over the synthetic
shell without penalty).

ASPHYXIATION
The average transhuman can hold their breath for
two minutes before blacking out. Strenuous activity
reduces the amount of time. For every 30 seconds
after the first minute a biomorph is prevented from
breathing, they must make a DUR Test. Apply a cu-
mulative –10 modifier each time this test is rolled. If
the character fails the test, they immediately fall un-
conscious and begin to suffer damage from asphyxi-
ation, at the rate of 10 points per minute, until they
die or are allowed to breathe again. This damage does
not cause wounds.
  Asphyxiating is a terrible process, often leading to
panic. Characters who are being asphyxiated must
make a WIL x 3 Test. If they fail, they suffer 1d10
÷ 2 (round up) mental stress and cannot perform
any effective action to rescue themselves that Action
turn. A character who succeeds may attempt to rescue
themselves, and in fact they must make a WIL x 3
Test to perform any other action not directly related
to rescuing themselves (attacks against another char-
acter, a creature, or an object holding the character
underwater are exempt from this rule).

BEAM WEAPONS
 Due to emitting a continuous beam of energy rather
 than single projectiles, beam weapons are easier to
“home in” on a target. This means one of the fol-
 lowing two rules may be used when making beam
 weapon attacks. These options are not available for
“pulse” beam weapons (like the laser pulser), as such
 weapons emit energy in pulses rather than a continu-
 ous beam.

SWEEPING FIRE
An attacker who is making two semi-auto (p. 198)
attacks with a beam weapon with the same Complex
Action and who misses with the first attack may treat
that attack as a free Aim action (p. 190), receiving a
+10 modifier for the second attack. In other words,
though the first attack misses, the character takes the
opportunity to sweep the beam closer to the target
for the second attack. This only applies when both
attacks are made against the same target.

%%% txt/198.txt
moving too fast for standard action and combat inter-
action with other characters. This is when the action
enters “chase scene” mode—a traveling narrative of
maneuvering choices and tests with various outcomes.
Whether or not a chase is actually occurring, the
gamemaster should remember that Max Velocity is
not the only factor in high-speed situations. Environ-
mental factors like terrain, weather conditions, navi-
gation, pedestrians, and traffic can provide obstacles
for shells to overcome. A shell tearing across a habitat
in order to reach a bomb before it detonates should
have to make several decisions and tests that may
affect whether it gets there in time or not. Likewise, a
shell seeking to shake off some hot pursuit will have
to pull off some fancy maneuvering and hopefully find
a shortcut or two in order to outrace their opponents.

CRASHING
Shells that suffer wounds during combat or chases
may be force to make a Pilot Test to avoid crashing
or may crash automatically. The exact circumstances
of a crash are left up to the gamemaster, as best fits
the story—the shell may simply skid to a stop, plow
into a tree, fall from the sky, or flip over and land on
a group of bystanders. Shells that strike other objects
when they crash typically take further damage from
the collision (see Collisions).

COLLISIONS
If a shell crashes into or intentionally rams a person
or object, someone is likely to get hurt. To determine
how much DV is inflicted, roll 1d10 and add the shell’s
DUR divided by 10 (round up). This is the damage
applied at walking speeds. If the shell was moving at
running speeds, multiply the DV by 2. If the shell was
moving at chase speeds, multiply the DV by the shell’s
velocity ÷ 10 in meters per turn. Both the shell and
whatever it strikes suffer this damage, assuming the
collision is with something equal dense and hard. Soft
and squishy objects like biomorphs will be less dam-
aging to a shell (unless they happen to be in a hardsuit
or battlesuit), in which case the shell will only suffer
half damage from the collision. Kinetic armor defends
against crash DV.
   If two moving shells collide head-on, calculate the
damage from both and inflict to both. If two shells
moving in the same direction collide, only count the
difference in velocity.
   Passengers in a vehicle may also be damaged by col-
lisions if they are not wearing proper safety restraints.
They suffer one half the DV applied to their vehicle.



         COLLISION DAMAGE
   Base Collision DV: 1d10 + (DUR ÷ 10)
   Running: DV x 2
   Chase Speeds: DV x (velocity ÷ 10)
ATTACKING VEHICLE PASSENGERS
During combat, passengers within a vehicle may be
targeted separately from the vehicle itself. Attacks
made against passengers this way do not harm the
vehicle itself (unless an area effect weapon is used).
Targeted passengers benefit both from cover (usually
Major, –30) and from the vehicle’s structure, adding
the vehicle’s Armor Value to their own.
  Passengers within a vehicle are generally not harmed
by attacks made against the vehicle itself. Exceptions
include area effect weapons and vehicle crashes. In
both these cases, the passengers also benefit from the
vehicle Armor Value.

SHELL REMOTE CONTROL
Any shell (or biomorph) with a puppet sock (also in-
 cluded with all cyberbrains) may be remote controlled,
 either by a character or a remote AI. This requires a
 communications link between the teleoperator and
 the shell (the “drone”). The teleoperator controls the
 drone via an entoptic interface, and receives sensory
input and other data via the drone’s mesh inserts.
   When under direct control, the shell’s AI (or resident
 ego) is subsumed and put on standby. The drone only
 acts as instructed. Each instruction counts as a Quick
Action. In this situation, the drone acts with the same
Initiative as the teleoperator. The teleoperator’s skills and
 stats are used in place of the shell AI’s. Due to the nature
 of remote operation, however, all tests are made with a
–10 modifier. Multiple drones may be controlled at once,
but commanding them requires separate Quick Actions
unless they are receiving the same command. Direct
 control teleoperation is not very feasible at extreme dis-
 tances, due to the light-speed lag with communications.
   Alternately, the teleoperator can put the drone in
autonomous mode, allowing the shell’s AI to resume
 normal operations. The drone still follows the teleop-
 erator’s commands to the best of its abilities. In this
 mode, the drone functions normally, using its own
Initiative and AI skills and stats.

SHELL JAMMING
“Jamming” is the colloquial term for a more direct
 form of remote-control, using VR and XP technol-
 ogy. When jamming, the drone’s puppet sock feeds
 the drone’s sensory data directly to the teleoperator’s
 mesh inserts. The teleoperator subsumes themself in
 the drone’s sensorium, essentially “becoming” the
 drone. In this case, the teleoperator surrenders con-
 trol of their own morph, which slumps inertly. While
 jamming, they suffer –60 on all Perception Tests or
 attempts to take action with their morph.
   Jamming takes a Complex Action to engage and
 disengage. A jamming teleoperator controls a drone
 as if it were their own morph. Like direct control te-
 leoperation, the jammer’s own skills and Initiative are
 used in place of the drone’s AI. Jammers do not suffer
 any teleoperation modifiers, but only one drone may
 be jammed at a time.

%%% txt/199.txt
  If the drone is killed or destroyed, the jammer is
immediately dumped from their connection, resuming
control of their own morph as normal. Getting dumped
in this manner is extremely jarring, not the least be-
cause the jammer experienced being killed/destroyed.
As a result, the jammer suffers 1d10 mental stress.

CALLED SHOTS
   Sometimes it’s not enough to just hit your target—
you need to shoot out a window, knock the knife out
of their hand, or hit that hole in their armor. You may
declare that you are making a called shot before you
initiate an attack, choosing one of the outcomes noted
below. Called shots suffer a –10 modifier and require
an Excellent Success (MoS 30+). If you beat that
margin, you succeed with the called shot, and the re-
sults noted below apply. If you don’t beat the margin
but still succeed in the attack, you simply strike your
target as normal.

BYPASSING ARMOR
Called shots may be used to target a hole or weak
point in your opponent’s armor. If you beat the MoS,
you strike an armor-defeating hit, and their armor
does not apply. Note that in certain circumstances, a
gamemaster may rule that an opponent’s armor simply
doesn’t have a weak spot or unprotected area, and so
disallow such called shots.

DISARMING
You may take a called shot to attempt to knock a
weapon out of an opponent’s hand(s). If you beat the
MoS, the victim suffers half damage from the attack (re-
duced by armor as normal) and must make a SOM x 3
Test with a –30 modifier to retain hold of the weapon.

SPECIFIC TARGETING
You may make a called shot with the intention of hitting
a specific location or component on your target—for
example: disabling the sensor unit on a bot, sweeping
someone’s leg, or poking someone in the eye. If you beat
the MoS, you hit the specific targeted spot. The game-
master determines the result as appropriate to the attack
and target—the component may be destroyed, the op-
ponent may fall or be temporarily blinded, and so on.

CHARGING
An opponent who runs and attacks an opponent in
melee combat in the same Action Phase is considered
to be charging. A charging attacker still suffers the
–10 modifier for running, but they receive a damage
bonus on account of their momentum: increase the
damage they inflict by +1d10.

RECEIVING A CHARGE
You may delay your action (see p. 189) in order to
receive a charge, bracing yourself for impact, inter-
rupting their action, and striking right before your
charging does. In this situation, you receive a +20
modifier for striking the charging opponent.
DEMOLITIONS
The most common use of the Demolitions skill is the
placement, disarming, or manufacture of explosive
devices, such as superthermite charges (p. 330) or
grenades (p. 340).

PLACING EXPLOSIVES
A skilled demolitionist can place charges in a manner
that will boost their effect. They can identify struc-
tural vulnerabilities and weak points and focus a
blast in these areas. They can determine how to blast
open a safe without destroying the contents. They can
focus the force of an explosion in a particular direc-
tion, increasing the directed force while minimizing
splash effects.
   Each of these scenarios calls for a successful De-
molitions Test. The exact result is determined by
the gamemaster according to the specific scenario.
For example, using the examples above, targeting
a weak point could double the damage inflicted on
that structure. Shaping the charge to direct the force
can triple the damage in that direction, as noted in
the superthermite description (p. 330). An Excellent
Success is likely to increase an explosive’s damage by
+5, whereas a critical success would allow the blast to
ignore armor.

DISARMING
Disarming an explosive device is handled as an Op-
posed Test between the Demolitions skills of the dis-
armer and the character who set the bomb.

MAKING EXPLOSIVES
A character trained in Demolitions can make ex-
plosives from raw materials. These materials can be
gathered the traditional way or they can be manufac-
tured using a nanofabricator. Even nanofabbers with
restricted settings to prevent explosives creation can
be used, as explosives can be constructed from all
manner of mundane chemicals and materials.
  The timeframe for making explosives is 1 hour per
1d10 points of damage the explosive will inflict. If a
critical failure is rolled, the demolitionist may acciden-
tally blow himself up, or the charge may be extremely
weaker or more potent than expected (whichever is
more likely to be disastrous).

FALLING
If a character falls, use the Falling Damage table to
determine what injuries they suffer. Kinetic armor
will mitigate this damage at
half its value (round down).
Gamemasters may also reduce             FALLING DA
this damage if anything helped
to break the fall (branches, soft      DISTANCE FALLEN
surface) at their discretion.           1–2 meters
                                        3–5 meters
                                        6–8 meters
                                        Over 8 meters

%%% txt/200.txt
FIRE
Objects that come into contact with extreme heat or
flames may catch fire at the gamemaster’s discretion,
keeping in mind both the flammability of the material
and the strength of the heat/flames. Burning items (or
characters) will suffer 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) damage
each Action Turn unless otherwise noted. Energy
armor will protect against this damage, though it
too may catch fire, reducing its value by the damage
inflicted. Depending on the environmental conditions,
fires are likely to grow larger unless somehow abated.
Every 5 Action Turns, increase the DV inflicted (first
to 1d10, then 2d10, then 3d10, then by increments
of +5). Adverse conditions (such as rain) or efforts to
extinguish the blaze will reduce the DV accordingly.
   Note that fire does not burn in vacuum. In micro-
gravity, fire burns in a sphere and grows more slowly,
as expanding gases push away the oxygen (increase
the DV every 10 Action Turns). If there is a lack of air
circulation, some microgravity fires may extinguish
themselves.

FIRING MODES AND RATE OF FIRE
Every ranged weapon in Eclipse Phase comes with one
or more firing modes that determines their rate of fire.
These firing modes are detailed below.

SINGLE SHOT (SS)
Single shot weapons may only be fired once per
Complex Action. These are typically larger or more
archaic devices.

SEMI-AUTOMATIC (SA)
Semi-automatic weapons are capable of quick, re-
peated fire. They may be fired twice with the same
Complex Action. Each shot is handled as a separate
attack.

BURST FIRE (BF)
Burst fire weapons release a number of quick shots
(a “burst”) with a single trigger pull. Two bursts may
be fired with the same Complex Action. Each burst
is handled as a separate attack. Bursts use up 3 shots
worth of ammunition.
   A burst may be shot against a single target (concen-
trated fire), or against two targets who are standing
within one meter of each other. In the case of concen-
trated fire against a single target, increase the DV by
+1d10.

FULL AUTOMATIC (FA)
Full-auto weapons release a hail of shots with a single
trigger pull. Only one full-auto attack may be made
with each Complex Action. This attack may be made a
single target or against up to three separate targets, as
long as each is within one meter of another. In the case
of a concentrated fire on a single individual, increase
the DV by +1d10 + 10. Firing in full automatic mode
uses up 10 shots.

FULL DEFENSE
If you’re expecting to come under fire, you can
expend a Complex Action to go on full defense. This
represents that you are expending all of your energy
to dodge, duck, ward off attacks, and otherwise get
the hell out of the way until your next Action Phase.
During this time, you receive a +30 modifier to defend
against all incoming attacks.
   Characters who are on full defense may use Free-
running rather than Fray skill to dodge attacks, repre-
senting the gymnastic movements they are making to
avoid being hit.

GRAVITY
Most characters in Eclipse Phase have considerable
experience maneuvering in low gravity or micro-
gravity and can perform normal actions without
penalties. Even characters who grew up on planetary
bodies or in rotating habitats have some familiarity
with alternate gravities thanks to childhood train-
ing in simulspace educational scenarios. The same is
also true in reverse; characters who grew up in free

%%% txt/201.txt
fall have likely experienced simulations of life in a
gravity well.
   At the gamemaster’s discretion, characters who
have spent long periods acclimating to one range of
gravity may find a shift in conditions a bit challeng-
ing to cope with, at least until they grow accustomed
to the new gravity. In this case, the gamemaster can
apply a –10 modifier to both physical and social skills.
The physical penalty results from simple difficulties
in maneuvering. The social penalty applies because
it’s hard to look impressive, intimidating, or seductive
when you haven’t figured out how to arrange your
clothes so that they don’t float up into your face. The
physical penalty can be increased to –20 for situa-
tions involving combat skills and skills requiring fine
manipulation, building, or repairing of items. These
penalties will apply until the character adjusts, which
typically takes about 3 days.
   Any biomorph with basic biomods (p. 300) is
immune to ill health from the effects of long-term
exposure to microgravity.

MICROGRAVITY
Microgravity includes both zero-G and gravities that
are slightly higher but negligible. These conditions are
found in space, on asteroids and some small moons,
and on (parts of) spaceships and habitats that are not
rotated for gravity. Objects in microgravity are effec-
tively weightless, but size and mass are still factors.
   Things behave differently in microgravity. For
example:

 • Objects not anchored down will tend to drift
   off in whatever direction they were last moving.
   Floating objects will eventually settle in the direc-
   tion of the densest part of the habitat or spacecraft.
 • Thrown or pushed items will travel in a straight
   line until they hit something.
 • Smoke does not rise in streams. Instead, it forms
   a roughly spherical halo around its source.
 • Liquids have little cohesion, scattering into clouds
   of tiny droplets if released into the air. Drinks
   come in sealed bulbs or bottles. Food is eaten so
   that sauces and bits of liquid don’t escape. Blood
   goes everywhere.

  Movement and maneuvering in microgravity is
handled using Free Fall skill (p. 179). Most everyday
activity in free fall does not require a test. The game-
master can, however, call for a Free Fall Test for any
complicated maneuvers, flying across major distances,
sudden changes in direction or velocity, or when en-
gaged in melee combat. A failed roll means the char-
acter has miscalculated and ends up in a position other
than intended. A Severe Failure means the character has
screwed up badly, such as slamming themselves into a
wall or sending themselves spinning off into space.
  For convenience, most microgravity habitats
feature furniture covered with elastic loops, mesh
pockets to keep individual objects from floating all
over the place, and moving beltways with hand loops
for major thoroughfares. Magnetic or velcro shoes
are also used to walk around, rather than climbing
or flying. Zero-g environments are often designed to
make maximum use of space, however, taking advan-
tage of the lack of ceilings and floors. Because object
are weightless, characters can move even massive
objects around easily.
   Movement Rate: Characters who are climbing, pull-
ing, or pushing themselves along move at half their
movement rate (p. 191) in microgravity.
   Terminal Velocity: It is not difficult to reach escape
velocity on small asteroids and similar bodies—
something to keep in mind with thrown objects and
projectile weapons. In some cases, characters who
move fast enough and jump can reach escape veloc-
ity themselves, though these situations are left up to
the gamemaster.

LOW GRAVITY
Low gravity includes anything from 0.5 g to micro-
gravity. These conditions are found on Luna, Mars,
Titan, and the rotating parts of most spun spacecraft
and habitats. Low gravity is not that different from
standard gravity, though characters may jump twice as
far and thrown/projectile objects have a longer range
(p. 203). Increase the running rate for characters in
low gravity by x1.5.

HIGH GRAVITY
High gravity is anything significantly stronger than
standard Earth gravity (1.2 g +). High gravity in
Eclipse Phase is typically only found on exoplanets.
High gravity can be particularly hard on characters
as their bodies are strained because they carry more
weights, muscles are fatigued from needing to push
more around, and the heart must work harder to
pump blood. For every 0.2 g over 1 that a character is
not acclimated to, treat it as if the character is suffer-
ing from the effects of 1 wound. At the gamemaster’s
discretion, movement rates may also be modified.

GRENADES AND SEEKERS
Modern grenades, seekers, and similar explosives do
not necessarily detonate the instant they are thrown
or strike the target. In fact, several trigger options
are available, each set by the user when deploying
the weapon. Missed attacks, or attacks that do not
explode in transit or when they strike, are subject to
scatter (p. 204).
  Airburst: Airburst means that the device explodes in
mid-air as soon as it travels a distance programmed at
launch. In this case, the explosive’s effects are resolved
immediately, in that user’s Action Phase. Note that
airburst munitions are programmed with a safety fea-
ture that will prevent detonation if they fail to travel
a minimum precautionary distance from the launcher,
though this can be overridden.
   Impact: The grenade or missile goes off as soon as it
hits something, whether that be the target, ground, or

%%% txt/202.txt
an intervening object. Resolve the effects immediately,
in the user’s Action Phase.
   Signal: The munition is primed for detonation upon
receiving a command signal via wireless link. The
device simply lays in wait until it receives the proper
signal (which must include the cryptographic key
assigned when the grenade was primed), detonating
immediately when it does.
   Timer: The device has a built-in timer allowing
the user to adjust exactly when it detonates. This
can be anywhere from 1 second to days, months, or
even years later, effectively using the device like a
bomb, but also increasing the likelihood it will be
discovered and neutralized. The minimum detona-
tion period—1 second—means that the munition will
detonate on the user’s (current) Initiative Score in the
next Action Phase. A 2-second delay would last two
Action Phases, a 3-second delay three Action phases,
and so on.

THROWING BACK GRENADES
It is possible that a character may be able to reach
a grenade before it detonates and throw it back (or
away in a safe direction). The character must be
within movement range of the grenade’s location, and
must take a Complex Action to make a REF + COO +
COO Test to catch the rolling, sliding grenade. If they
succeed, they may throw the grenade off in a direc-
tion of their choice with the same action (treat as a
standard throwing attack).
   If the character fails the test, however, they may find
themselves at ground zero when it detonates.

JUMPING ON
Given the possibility of resleeving, a character may
decide to take one for the team and throw themselves
on a grenade, sacrificing themselves in order to protect
others. The character must be within movement range
of the grenade’s location, and must take a Complex
Action to make a REF + COO + WIL Test to fall on
the grenade and cover it with their morph. This means
the character suffers an extra 1d10 damage when the
grenade detonates. On the positive side, the grenade’s
damage is reduced by the sacrificing character’s armor
+ 10 when its damage effects are applied to others
within the blast radius.
  If the gamemaster feels it appropriate, a WIL x 3
Test might be called for in order for a character to
sacrifice themselves in this manner.

HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS
  The solar system might be friendly to life on a grand
scale, but if you’re stranded in the gravity well of Jupi-
ter during a magnetic storm, trying to breathe without
a respirator on Mars, or swimming in hard vacuum
without a space suit, it doesn’t seem so friendly. This
section describes a few of the hostile environments
that characters in Eclipse Phase might face.
ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINATION
Habitats sometimes fall ill. The effects of a habitat
 suffering from ecological imbalance or out-of-control
pathogens can range from mildly allergenic habitat
atmospheres to rampaging environmental sepsis.
Characters without breathing or filtration gear in a
 contaminated environment should suffer penalties
to physical and possibly social skills, ranging from
–10 (mild contamination) to –30 (severely septic at-
mosphere). Depending on the contamination, other
 effects may apply, as the gamemaster sees fit.

EXTREME HEAT AND COLD
Planetary environments can range from the extremely
hot (Venus, Mercury’s day side) to the extremely frigid
(Neptune, Titan, Uranus). Both are likely to kill an un-
protected and unmodified biomorph within minutes, if
not seconds. Synthmorphs and vehicles fare better, es-
pecially in the cold, but even they are likely to quickly
succumb to the blazing furnaces of the inner planets
without strong heat shields and cooling systems.

EXTREME PRESSURE
  Similarly, the atmospheric pressures of Jupiter,
Saturn, and Venus quickly become crushingly deadly
anywhere beyond the upper levels. Only synthmorphs
and vehicles with special pressure adaptations can
hope to survive such depths.

GRAVITY TRANSITION ZONES
  The widespread use of artificial gravity in space
habitats means that characters will often encounter
places where the direction of down suddenly changes.
In most rotating habitats, the standard design in-
cludes an axial zone where spacecraft can dock in
microgravity and a carefully designed and marked
transition zone (usually an elevator) where people and
cargo coming and going from the axial spaceport can
orient to local “down” and be standing in the right
place when gravity takes effect. Gravity transitions in
rotating habitats are almost always gradual but can
be very dangerous if a character encounters them in
the wrong place or time.
  A character cast adrift in the microgravity zone at
the axis of a rotating space habitat will slowly drift
outward until they begin to encounter gravity, at
which point they will fall. How long this takes varies
on the size of the habitat. A good rule of thumb is that
for each kilometer of diameter possessed by the habi-
tat, the character has 30 seconds before they begin to
fall. If the character was given a good push out from
the axis when set adrift, this time should be halved,
quartered, or more at the gamemaster’s discretion.

MAGNETIC FIELDS
Magnetism isn’t a direct problem for most characters;
transhumans need to worry more about the radiation
generated by a powerful magnetosphere. For un-
shielded electronic devices and similarly unshielded
transhumans sporting titanium, however, the effects

%%% txt/203.txt
of strong magnetic fields can be devastating. Note that
many of the conditions that result in vehicles, bots,
and gear being exposed to strong magnetic field activ-
ity coincide with strong radioactivity.
   Magnetic fields affect synthmorphs, robots, vehicles,
cybernetic implants, and electronics after 1 minute of
exposure. Like radiation exposure, these effects can
vary drastically. At the low end, communication and
sensors will suffer interference and shortened ranges;
at high ends, electronic systems will simply suffer
damage and fail.

RADIATION
Ionizing radiation is one of the more prevalent haz-
ards in the solar system and one of the most difficult
problems for transhumanity to defeat. Radiation
damages genetic material, sickens, and kills by ion-
izing the chemicals involved in cell division within the
human body. Effects range from nausea and fatigue to
massive organ failure and death. However, radiation
sickness is not solely a somatic phenomenon. The real
terror of radiation for transhumans, especially at high
dose levels such as those experienced on the surface of
Ganymede and other Jovian moons, is damage to the
neural network. This can lead to flawed uploads and
backups. Nanomedicine that can rapidly reverse the
ionization of cellular chemicals and new materials that
offer thinner and better shielding help, but the sheer
magnitude of the radiation put out by some bodies in
the solar system defeats even these.
   Radiation poisoning is a complicated affair, and de-
tailed rules are beyond the scope of this book. Sources
of radiation include the Earth’s Van Allen belt, Jupi-
ter’s radiation belt, Saturn’s magnetosphere, cosmic
rays, solar flares, fission materials, unshielded fusion
or antimatter explosions, and nuclear blasts, among
others. Effects can vary drastically depending on the
strength of the source, the amount of time exposed,
and the level of shielding available. The immediate
effects on biomorphs (manifesting anywhere from
within minutes to 6 hours) can include nausea, vomit-
ing, fatigue (reduced SOM), as well as both physical
damage and minor amounts of mental stress. This
is followed by a latency period where the biomorph
seems to get better, lasting anywhere from 6 hours
to 2 weeks. After this point, the final effects kick in,
which can include hair loss, sterility, reduced SOM
and DUR, severe damage to gastric and intestinal
tissue, infections, uncontrolled bleeding, and death.
   Synthmorphs are not quite as vulnerable as
biomorphs, but even they can be damaged and dis-
abled by severe radiation dosages.

TOXIC ATMOSPHERE
Neptune, Titan, Uranus, and Venus all have toxic
atmospheres. Similar atmospheres may be found on
some exoplanets, or might be intentionally created as
a security measure within a habitat or structure.
  A character who is unaware of atmospheric toxicity
and does not immediately hold their breath (requir-
ing a REF x 3 Test) suffers 10 points of damage per
Action Turn. A character who manages to hold their
breath can last a bit longer; apply the rules for as-
phyxiation (p. 194).
  Corrosive Atmospheres: In addition to being toxic,
Venus has the only naturally occurring corrosive at-
mosphere in the system. Corrosive atmospheres are
immediately dangerous: characters take 10 points of
damage per Action Turn, regardless of whether they
hold their breath or not. Corrosive atmospheres also
damage vehicles and gear not equipped with anti-
corrosive shielding. Such items take 1 point of damage
per minute. At greater concentrations, such as in the
dense sulfuric acid clouds in the upper atmosphere of
Venus, items takes 5 points of damage per minute.

UNBREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE
Very few of the planetary bodies in the solar system
actually have toxic atmospheres. In most unbreathable
atmospheres, the primary hazard for transhumans
without breathing apparatus or modifications to their
morph is lack of oxygen. Treat exposure to unbreath-
able atmospheres the same as asphyxiation.

UNDERWATER
In general, any physical skill performed underwater suf-
fers a –20 penalty due to the resistance of the medium.
Skills relying on equipment not adapted for underwa-
ter use may be more difficult or impossible to use. A
character’s movement rate while swimming or walking
underwater is one quarter their normal rate on land.
If a character begins to drown underwater, follow the
rules for asphyxiation (p. 194). Note that drowning
characters do not immediately recover if rescued from
the water; they will continue to asphyxiate until medical
treatment is applied to clear the water from their lungs.

VACUUM
   Biomorphs without vacuum sealing (p. 305) can
spend one minute in the vacuum of space with no ill
effects, provided they curl up into a ball, empty their
lungs of air, and keep their eyes closed (something kids
in space habitats learn at a very young age). Contrary
to popular depictions in pre-Fall media, a character
exposed to hard vacuum does not explosively de-
compress, nor do their internal fluids boil (other than
relatively exposed liquids such as saliva on the tongue).
Rather, the primary danger for characters on EVA sans
vacsuit is asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen and as-
sociated complications such as edema in the lungs.
   After one minute in space, the character begins to
suffer from asphyxiation (p. 194). Damage is doubled
if the character tries to hold air in their lungs or is not
curled up in a vacuum survival position as described
above. Additionally, characters trapped in space with-
out adequate thermal protection suffer 10 points of
damage per minute from the extreme cold.

 IMPROVISED WEAPONS
 Sometimes characters are caught off-guard and they
 must use whatever they happen to have at hand as
 a weapon—or they think they look cool wailing on
 someone with a meter of chain. The Improvised Weap-
 ons table offers statistics for a few likely ad-hoc items.
 Gamemasters can use these as guidelines for handling
 items that aren’t listed.

 KNOCKDOWN/KNOCKBACK
 If an attacker’s intent is to simply knock an opponent
 down or back in melee, rather than injure them, roll
 the attack and defense as normal. If the attacker suc-
 ceeds, the defender is knocked backward by 1 meter
 per 10 full points of MoS. To knock an opponent
 down, the attacker must score an Excellent Success
 (MoS 30+). A knockback/knockdown attack must be
 declared before dice are rolled.
    Unless the attacker rolls a critical success, no
 damage is inflicted with this attack, the defender is
 simply knocked down. If the attacker rolls a critical
 hit, however, apply damage as normal in addition to
 the knockback/knockdown.
    Note that characters wounded by an attack may
 also be knocked down (see Wound Effects, p. 207).

 MELEE AND THROWN DAMAGE BONUS
 Every successful melee and thrown weapon attack,
 whether unarmed or with a weapon, receives a damage
 bonus equal to the attacker’s SOM ÷ 10, round down.
 See Damage Bonus, p. 123.

 MULTIPLE TARGETS
 When doling out the damage, there’s no reason not to
 share the love.

 MELEE COMBAT
 A character taking a Complex Action to engage in a
 melee attack may choose to attack two or more op-
 ponents with the same action. Each opponent must be
 within one meter of another attacked opponent. These
 attacks must be declared before the dice are rolled for
 the first attack. Each attack suffers a cumulative –20
 modifier for each extra target. So if a character declares
 they are going to attack three characters with the same
 action, they suffer a cumulative –60 on each attack.

      RANGED COMBAT
     A character firing two semi-auto shots with a Complex
     Action may target a different opponent with each shot.
     In this case, the attacker suffers a –20 modifier against
     the second target.
        A character firing a burst-fire weapon may target up
     to two targets with each burst, as long as those targets
     are within one meter of one another. This is handled
     as a single attack; see Burst Fire, p. 198.
        A character firing a burst-fire weapon twice with
     one Complex Action may target a different person or
     pair with each burst. In this case, the second burst
     suffers a –20 modifier. This modifier does not apply
     if the same person/pair targeted with the first burst is
     targeted again.
        Full-auto attacks may also be directed at more than
     one target, as long as each target is within one meter
     of the previous target. This is handled as a single
     attack; see Full Auto, p. 198.

      OBJECTS AND STRUCTURES
     As any poor wall in the vicinity of an enraged drunk
     can tell you, objects and structures are not immune
     to violence and attrition. To reflect this, inanimate
     objects and structures are given Durability, Wound
     Threshold, and Armor scores, just like characters. Du-
     rability measures how much damage the structure can
     take before it is destroyed. Armor reduces the damage
     inflicted by attacks, as normal. For simplicity, a single
     Armor rating is given that counts as both Energy and
     Kinetic armor; at the gamemaster’s discretion, these
     may be modified as appropriate.
       Wounds suffered by objects and structures do not have
     the same effect as wounds inflicted on characters. Each
     wound is simply treated as a hole, partial demolition, or
     impaired function, as the gamemaster sees fit. Alternately,
     a wounded device may function less effectively, and so
     may inflict a negative modifier on skill tests made while
     using that object (a cumulative –10 per wound).
        In the case of large structures, it is recommended
     that individual parts of the structure be treated as
     separate entities for the purpose of inflicting damage.

      RANGED ATTACKS
     Ranged combat attacks inflict only one-third their
     damage (round down) on large structures such

 as doors, walls, etc. This reflects the fact that most
 ranged attacks simply penetrate the structure, leaving
 minor damage.
   Agonizers and stunners have no effect on objects
 and structures.

 SHOOTING THROUGH
 If a character attempts to shoot through an object or
 structure at a target on the other side, the attack is
 likely to suffer a blind fire modifier of at least –30
 unless the attack has some way of viewing the target.
 On top of this, the target receives an armor bonus
 equal to the object/structure’s Armor rating x 2.

 RANGE
Every type of ranged weapon has a limited range,
beyond which it is ineffective. The effective range of
the weapon is further broken down into four catego-
ries: Short, Medium, Long, and Extreme. A modifier
is applied for each category, as noted on the Combat
Modifiers table, p. 193.
   For examples of specific weapon ranges, see the
Weapon Ranges table.

 RANGE, GRAVITY, AND VACUUM
 The ranges listed on the Weapon Ranges table are for
 Earth-like gravity conditions (1 g). While the effective
 ranges of kinetic, seeker, spray, and thrown weapons
 can potentially increase in lower gravity environments
 due to lack of gravitational forces or aerodynamic
 drag, accuracy is still the defining factor for determin-
 ing whether you hit or miss a target. In lower gravi-
 ties, use the same effective ranges listed, but extend
 the maximum range by dividing it by the gravity (for
 example, a max range of 100 meters would be 200
 meters in 0.5 g). In microgravity and zero g, the maxi-
 mum range is effectively line of sight. Likewise, under
 high-gravity conditions (over 1 g), divide each range
 category maximum by the gravity (e.g., a short range
 of 10 meters would be 5 meters in 2 g).
    Beam weapons are not affected by gravity, but they
 do fare much better in non-atmospheric conditions.
 Maximum beam weapon range in vacuum is effec-
 tively line of sight.

REACH
Some weapons extend a character’s reach, giving
them a significant advantage over an opponent in
melee combat. This applies to any weapon over half
a meter long: axes, clubs, swords, shock batons, etc.
Whenever one character has a reach advantage over
another, they receive a +10 modifier for both attacking
and defending.

SCATTER
When you are using a blast weapon, you may still
catch your target in the blast radius even if you fail to
hit them directly. Weapons such as grenades must go
somewhere when they miss, and exactly where they
land may be important to the outcome of a battle. To
determine where a missed blast attack falls, the scatter
rules are called into play.
  To determine scatter, roll a d10 and note where the
die “points” (using yourself as the reference point).
This is the direction from the target that the missed
blast lands. The die roll also determines how far away
the blast lands, in meters. If the MoF on the attack is
over 30, this distance is doubled. If the MoF exceeds
60, the distance is tripled. This point determines the
epicenter of the blast; resolve the effects of damage
against anyone caught within its sphere of effect as
normal (see Blast Effect, p. 193).

SHOCK ATTACKS
Shock weapons use high-voltage electrical jolts to
physically stun and incapacitate targets. Shock weap-
ons are particularly effective against biomorphs and
pods, even when heavily armored. Synthmorphs, bots,
and vehicles are immune to shock weapon effects.
   A biomorph struck with a shock weapon must
make a DUR + Energy Armor Test (using their cur-
rent DUR score, reduced by damage they have taken).
If they fail, they immediately lose neuromuscular
 control, fall down, and are incapacitated for 1 Action
Turn per 10 full points of MoF (minimum of 3 Action
Turns). During this time they are stunned and inca-
pable of taking any action, possibly convulsing, suf-
fering vertigo, nausea, etc. After this period, they may
act but they remain stunned and shaken, suffering a
–30 modifier to all actions. This modifier reduces by
10 per minute (so –20 after 1 minute, –10 after 2 min-
utes, and no modifier after 3 minutes). Many shock
weapons also inflict DV, which is handled as normal.
   A biomorph that succeeds the DUR Test is still
shocked but not incapacitated. They suffer half the
listed DV and suffer a –30 modifier until the end of
the next Action Turn. This modifier reduces by 10 per
Action Turn. Modifiers from additional shocks are
not cumulative, but will boost the modifier back to
its maximum value.

SUBDUAL
To grapple an opponent in melee combat, you must
declare your intent to subdue before making the die
roll. Any appropriate melee skill may be used for the
attack; if wielding a weapon, it may be used as part of
the grappling technique. If you succeed in your attack
with an Excellent Success (MoS of 30+), you have suc-
cessfully subdued your opponent (for the moment, at
least). Grappling attacks do not cause damage unless
you roll a critical success (though even in this case you
can choose not to).
   A subdued opponent is temporarily restrained or
immobilized. They may communicate, use mental
skills, and take mesh actions, but they may not take
any physical actions other than trying to break free.
(At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may make small,
restrained physical actions, such as reaching for a
knife in their pocket or grabbing an item dropped a
few centimeters away on the floor, but these actions
should suffer at least a –30 modifier and may be no-
ticed by their grappler).
   To break free, a grappled character must take a
Complex Action and succeed in either an Opposed
Unarmed Combat Test or an Opposed SOM x 3 Test,
though the subdued character suffers a –30 modifier
on this test.

SUPPRESSIVE FIRE
A character firing a weapon in full-auto mode (p. 198)
may choose to lay down suppressive fire over an area
rather than targeting anyone specifically, with the
intent of making everyone in the suppressed area keep
their heads down. This takes a Complex Action, uses
up 20 shots, and lasts until the character’s next Action
Phase. The suppressed area extends out in a cone, with
the widest diameter of the cone being up to 20 meters
across. Any character who is not behind cover or who
does not immediately move behind cover on their
action is at risk of getting hit by the suppressive fire. If
they move out of cover inside the suppressed area, the
character laying down suppressive fire gets one free
attack against them, which they may defend against
as normal. Apply no modifiers to these tests except
for range, wounds, and full defense. If hit, the struck
character must resist damage as if from a single shot.

SURPRISE
Characters who wish to ambush another must seek to
gain the advantage of surprise. This typically means
sneaking up on, lying in wait, or sniping from a hard-
to-perceive position in the distance. Any time an am-
busher (or group of ambushers) attempts to surprise a

%%% txt/207.txt
target (or group of targets), make a secret Perception
Test for the ambushee(s). Unless they are alert for sur-
prises, this test should suffer the typical –20 modifier
for being distracted. This is an Opposed Test against
the ambusher(s) Infiltration skill. Depending on the
attacker’s position, other modifiers may also apply
(distance, visibility, cover, etc.).
   If the Perception Test fails, the character is surprised
by the attack and cannot react to or defend against it. In
this case, simply give the attacker(s) a free Action Phase
to attack the surprised character(s). Once the attackers
have taken their actions, roll Initiative as normal.
   If the Perception Test succeeds, the character is
alerted to something a split-second before they are
ambushed, giving them a chance to react. In this case,
roll Initiative as normal, but the ambushed character(s)
suffers a –30 modifier to the Initiative Test. The am-
bushed character may still defend as normal.
   In a group situation, things can get more compli-
cated when some characters are surprised and others
aren’t. In this case, roll Initiative as normal, with all
non-ambushers suffering the –30 modifier. Any charac-
ters who are surprised are simply unable to take action
on the first Action Phase, as they are caught off-guard
and must take a moment to assess what’s going on
and get caught up with the action. As above, surprised
characters my not defend on this first Action Phase.

TACTICAL NETWORKS
Tactical networks are specialized software programs
used by teams that benefit from the sharing of tacti-
cal data. They are commonly used by sports teams,
security outfits, military units, AR gamers, gatecrash-
ers, surveyors, miners, traffic control, scavengers, and
anyone else who needs a tactical overview of a situa-
tion. Firewall teams regularly take advantage of them.
   In game terms, tacnets provide specialized software
skills and tools to a muse or AI, as best fits their tac-
tical needs. These tools link together and share and
analyze data between all of the participants in the
network, creating a customizable entoptics display for
each user that summarizes relevant data, highlights
interactions and priorities, and alerts the user to mat-
ters that require their attention.
COMBAT TACNETS
The following list is a sample of a typical combat tacnet’s
features. Gamemasters are encouraged to modify and
expand these options as appropriate to their game:

  • Maps: Tacnets assemble all available maps and
    can present them to the user with a bird’s eye
    view or as a three-dimensional interactive, with
    distances between relevant features readily acces-
    sible. The AI or muse can also plot maps based
    on sensory input, breadcrumb positioning sys-
    tems (p. 332), and other data. Plotted paths and
    other data from these maps can be displayed as
    entoptic images or other AR sensory input (e.g.,
    a user who should be turning left might see a
    transparent red arrow or feel a tingling sensation
    on their left side).
  • Positioning: The exact positioning of the user and
    all other participants are updated and mapped
    according to mesh positioning and GPS. Likewise,
    the positioning of known people, bots, vehicles,
    and other features can also be plotted according
    to sensory input.
  • Sensory Input: Any sensory input available to a
    participating character or device in the network
    can be fed into the system and shared. This
    includes data from cybernetic senses, portable
    sensors, smartlink guncams, XP output, etc. This
    allows one user to immediately call up and access
    the sensor feed of another user.
  • Communications Management: The tacnet
    maintains an encrypted link between all users
    and stays wary both of participants who drop
    out or of attempts to hack or interfere with the
    communications link.
  • Smartlink/Weapon Data: The tacnet monitors the
    status of weapons, accessories, and other gear via
    the smartlink interface or wireless link, bringing
    damage, shortages, and other issues to the user’s
    attention.
  • Indirect Fire: Members of a tacnet can provide
    targeting data to each other for purposes of indi-
    rect fire (p. 195).
  • Analysis: The muses and AIs participating in
    the tacnet are bolstered with skill software and

%%% txt/208.txt
     databases that enable them to interpret incom-
     ing data and sensory feeds. Perhaps the most
     useful aspect of tacnets, this means that the
     muse/AI may notice facts or details individual
     users are likely to have overlooked. For example,
     the tacnet can count shots fired by opponents,
     note when they are likely running low, and
     even analyze sensory input to determine the
     type of weaponry and ammunition being used.
     Opponents and their gear can also be scanned
     and analyzed to note potential weaknesses, in-
     juries, and capabilities. If sensor contact with
     an opponent is lost, the last known location is
     memorized and potential movement vectors and
     distances are displayed. Opponent positioning
     can also identify lines of sight and fields of fire,
     alerting the user to areas of potential cover or
     danger. The tacnet can also suggest tactical ma-
     neuvers that will aid the user, such as flanking an
     opponent or acquiring better elevation.

  Many of these features are immediately accessible
to the user via their AR display; other data can be ac-
cessed with a Quick Action. Likewise, the gamemaster
decides when the muse/AI provides important alerts to
the user. At the gamemaster’s discretion, some of these
features may apply modifiers to the character’s tests.

TOUCH-ONLY ATTACK
Some types of attacks simply require you to touch your
target, rather than injure them, and are correspond-
ingly easier. This might apply when trying to slap them
with a dermal drug patch, spreading a contact poison
on their skin, or making skin-to-skin contact for the
use of a psi sleight. In situations like this, apply a +20
modifier to your melee attacks.

TWO-HANDED WEAPONS
Any weapon noted as two-handed requires two hands
(or other prehensile limbs) to wield effectively. This
applies to some archaic melee weapons (large swords,
spears, etc.) in addition to certain larger firearms and
heavy weapons. Any character that attempts to use
such a weapon single-handed suffers a –20 modifier.

WIELDING TWO OR MORE WEAPONS
It is possible for a character to wield two weapons
in combat, or even more if they are an octomorph or
multi-limbed synthmorph. In this case, each weapon
that is held in an off-hand suffers a –20 off-hand
weapon modifier. This modifier may be offset with the
Ambidextrous trait (p. 145).

EXTRA MELEE WEAPONS
The use of two or more melee weapons is treated as
a single attack, rather than multiple. Each additional
weapon applies +1d10 damage to the attack (up to a
maximum +3d10). If the character attacks multiple
targets with the same Complex Action (see Mul-
tiple Targets, p. 202), this bonus does not apply. The
attacker must, of course, be capable of actually wield-
ing the additional weapons. A splicer with only two
hands cannot wield a knife and a two-handed sword,
for example. Likewise, the gamemaster may ignore
this damage bonus for extra weapons that are too dis-
similar to use together effectively (like a whip and a
pool cue). Note that extra limbs do not count as extra
weapons in unarmed combat, nor do weapons that
come as a pair (such as shock gloves).
  A character using more than one melee weapon
receives a bonus for defending against melee attacks
equal to +10 per extra weapon  (maximum +30).

EXTRA RANGED WEAPONS
Similarly, an attacker can wield a pistol in each hand
for ranged combat, or larger weapons if they have
more limbs (an eight-limbed octomorph, for example,
could conceivably hold four assault rifles). These
weapons may all be fired at once towards the same
target. In this case, each weapon is handled as a sepa-
rate attack, with each off-hand weapon suffering a
cumulative off-hand weapon modifier (no modifier for
the first attack, –20 for the second, –40 for the third,
and –60 for the fourth), offset by the Ambidextrous
trait (p. 145) as usual.



PHYSICAL HEALTH
In a setting as dangerous as Eclipse Phase, characters
are inevitably going to get hurt. Whether your morph
is biological or synthetic, you can be injured by weap-
ons, brawling, falling, accidents, extreme environ-
ments, psi attacks, and so on. This section discusses
how to track such injuries and determine what effect
they have on your character. Two methods are used
to gauge a character’s physical health: damage points
and wounds.

DAMAGE POINTS
Any physical harm that befalls your character is mea-
sured in damage points. These points are cumulative,
and are recorded on your character sheet. Damage
points are characterized as fatigue, stun, bruises,
bumps, sprains, minor cuts, and similar hurts that,
while painful, do not significantly impair or threaten
your character’s life unless they accumulate to a signif-
icant amount. Any source of harm that inflicts a large
amount of damage points at once, however, is likely to
have a more severe effect (see Wounds, p. 207).
   Damage points may be reduced by rest, medical
care, and/or repair (see Healing and Repair, p. 208).

DAMAGE TYPES
Physical damage comes in three forms: Energy, Kinetic,
and Psi.

ENERGY DAMAGE
Energy damage includes lasers, plasma guns, fire, electro-
cution, explosions, and others sources of damaging energy.

%%% txt/209.txt
KINETIC DAMAGE
Kinetic damage is caused by projectiles and other
objects moving at great speeds that disperse their
energy into the target upon impact. Kinetic attacks
include slug-throwers, flechette weapons, knives, and
punches.

PSI DAMAGE
Psi damage is caused by offensive psi sleights like
Psychic Stab (p. 228).

DURABILITY AND HEALTH
Your character’s physical health is measured by their
Durability stat. For characters sleeved in biomorphs,
this figure represents the point at which accumu-
lated damage points overwhelm your character and
they fall unconscious. Once you have accumulated
damage points equal to or exceeding your Durability
stat, you immediately collapse from exhaustion and
physical abuse. You remain unconscious and may
not be revived until your damage points are reduced
below your Durability, either from medical care or
natural healing.
   If you are morphed in a synthetic shell, Durabil-
ity represents your structural integrity. You become
physically disabled when accumulated damage points
reach your Durability. Though your computer systems
are likely still functioning and you can still mesh, your
morph is broken and immobile until repaired.

DEATH
An extreme accumulation of damage points can
threaten your character’s life. If the damage reaches
your Durability x 1.5 (for biomorphs) or Durability x
2 (for synthetic morphs), your body dies. This known
as your Death Rating. Synthetic morphs that reach
this state are destroyed beyond repair.

DAMAGE VALUE
Weapons (and other sources of injury) in Eclipse
Phase have a listed Damage Value (DV)—the base
amount of damage points the weapon inflicts. This is
often presented as a variable amount, in the form of a
die roll; for example: 3d10. In this case, you roll three
ten-sided dice and add up the results (counting 0 as
10). Sometimes the DV will be presented as a dice roll
plus modifier; for example: 2d10 + 5. In this case you
roll two ten-sided dice, add them together, and then
add 5 to get the result.
  For simplicity, a static amount is also noted in
parentheses after the variable amount. If you prefer
to skip the dice rolling, you can just apply the static
amount (usually close to the mean average) instead.
For example, if the damage were noted 2d10 + 5 (15),
you could simply apply 15 damage points instead of
rolling dice.
  When damage is inflicted on a character, determine the
DV (roll the dice) and subtract the modified armor value,
as noted under Step 7: Determine Damage (p. 192).
WOUNDS
Wounds represent more grievous injuries: bad cuts and
hemorrhaging, fractures and breaks, mangled limbs,
and other serious damage that impairs your ability to
function and may lead to death or long-term damage.
  Any time your character sustains damage, compare
the amount inflicted (after it has been reduced by
armor) to your Wound Threshold. If the modified DV
equals or exceeds your Wound Threshold, you have
suffered a wound. If the inflicted damage is double
your Wound Threshold, you suffer 2 wounds; if
triple your Wound Threshold, you suffer 3 wounds;
and so on.
  Wounds are cumulative, and must be marked on
your character sheet.
   Note that these rules handle damage and wounds
as an abstract concept. For drama and realism,
gamemasters may wish to describe wounds in more
detailed and grisly terms: a broken ankle, a severed
tendon, internal bleeding, a lost ear, and so on. The
nature of such descriptive injuries may help the game-
master assign other effects. For example, a character
with a crushed hand may not be able to pick up a gun,
someone with excessive blood loss may leave a trail
for their enemies to follow, or someone with a cut eye
may suffer an additional visual perception modifier.
Likewise, such details may impact how a character is
treated or heals.

WOUND EFFECTS
Each wound applies a cumulative –10 modifier to all
of the character’s actions. A character with 3 wounds,
for example, suffers –30 to all actions.
  Some traits, morphs, implants, drugs, and psi allow
a character to ignore wound modifiers. These effects
are cumulative, though the maximum amount of
wound modifiers that may be negated is –30.
  Knockdown: Any time a character takes a wound,
they must make an immediate SOM x 3 Test. Wound
modifiers apply. If they fail, they are knocked down
and must expend a Quick Action to get back up. Bots
and vehicles must make a Pilot Test to avoid crashing.
  Unconsciousness: Any time a character receives 2
or more wounds at once (from the same attack), they
must also make an immediate SOM x 3 Test; wound
modifiers again apply. If they fail, they have been
knocked unconscious. Bots and vehicles that take 2 or
more wounds at once automatically crash (see Crash-
ing, p. 196).
  Bleeding: Any biomorph character who has suffered
a wound and who takes damage that exceeds their
Durability is in danger of bleeding to death. They
incur 1 additional damage point per Action Turn (20
per minute) until they receive medical care or die.

DEATH
For many people in Eclipse Phase, death is not the end
of the line. If the character’s cortical stack can be re-
trieved, they can be resurrected and downloaded into
a new morph (see Resleeving, p. 271). This typically

%%% txt/210.txt
 requires either backup insurance (p. 269) or the good
 graces of whomever ends up with their body/stack.
    If the cortical stack is not retrievable, the character
 still be re-instantiated from an archived backup (p.
 268). Again, this either requires backup insurance or
 someone who is willing to pay to have them revived.
    If the character’s cortical stack is not retrieved
 and they have no backup, then they are completely
 and utterly dead. Gone. Kaput. (Unless they happen
 to have an alpha fork of themselves floating around
 somewhere; see Forking and Merging, p. 273.)



 HEALING AND REPAIR
 Use the follow rules for healing and repairing dam-
 aged and wounded characters.

 BIOMORPH HEALING
 Thanks to advanced medical technologies, there are
 many ways for characters in biological morphs (in-
 cluding pods) to heal injuries. Medichine nanoware
 (p. 308) helps characters to heal quickly, as do nano-
 bandages (p. 333). Healing vats (p. 326) will heal even
 the most grievous wounds in a matter of days, and
 can even restore characters who recently died or have
 been reduced to just a head.
   Characters without access to these medical tools are
 not without hope, of course. The medical skills of a
 trained professional can abate the impact of wounds,
 and over time bodies will of course heal themselves.

 MEDICAL CARE
 Characters with an appropriate Medicine skill (such
 as Medicine: Paramedic or Medicine: Trauma Sur-
 gery) can perform first aid on damaged or wounded
 characters. A successful Medicine Test, modified as
 the gamemaster deems fit according to situational
 conditions, will heal 1d10 points of damage and will
 remove 1 wound. This test must be made within 24
 hours of the injury, and any particular injury may only
 be treated once. If the character is later injured again,
 however, this new damage may also be treated. Medi-
 cal care of this sort is not effective against injuries that
 have been treated with medichines, nanobandages, or
 healing vats.



                                                                  HEA

  a remote station, the wilds of Mars, or the like—may
  be forced to heal naturally if injured. Natural healing
  is a slow process that’s heavily influenced by a number
  of factors. In order for a character to heal wounds,
  all normal damage must be healed first. Consult the
  Healing table.

  SURGERY
 In Eclipse Phase, most grievous injuries can be han-
 dled by time in a healing vat (p. 326) or simply rest
 and recovery. In circumstances where a healing vat is
 not available, the gamemaster may decide that a par-
 ticular wound requires actual surgery from an intelli-
 gent being (whether a character or AI-driven medbot).
 Usually in this case the character will be incapable of
 further healing until the surgery occurs. The surgery
 is handled as a Medical Test using a field appropriate
 to the situation and with a timeframe of 1–8 hours. If
 successful, the character is healed of 1d10 damage and
 1 wound and recovers from that point on as normal.

  SYNTHMORPH AND OBJECT REPAIR
  Unlike biomorphs, synthetic morphs and objects do not
  heal damage on their own and must be repaired. Some
  synthmorphs and devices have advanced nanotech self-
  repair systems, similar to medichines for biomorphs (see
  Fixers, p. 329). Repair spray (p. 333) may also be used
  to conduct fixes and is an extremely useful option for
  non-technical people. Barring these options, technicians
  may also work repairs the old-fashioned way, using
  their skills and tools (see Physical Repairs, below). As a
  last resort, synthmorphs and objects may be repaired in
  a nanofabrication machine with the appropriate blue-
  prints (using the same rules as healing vats, p. 326).

  PHYSICAL REPAIRS
  Manually fixing a synthmorph or object requires a
  Hardware Test using a field appropriate to the item
  (Hardware: Robotics for synthmorphs and bots,
  Hardware: Aerospace for aircraft, etc.), with a –10
  modifier per wound. Repair is a Task Action with
  a timeframe of 2 hours per 10 points of damage
  being restored, plus 8 hours per wound. Appropriate



ING
AMAGE HEALING RATE              WOUND HEALING RATE
  1d10 (5) per day                     1 per week
1d10 (5) per 12 hours                  1 per 3 days
 1d10 (5) per 2 hours                   1 per day
 1d10 (5) per 1 hour                  1 per 12 hours

  double timeframe                  double timeframe

   triple timeframe                 no wound healing

%%% txt/211.txt
modifiers should be applied, based on conditions and
available tools. For example, utilitools (p. 326) apply
a +20 modifier to repair tests, while repair spray ap-
plies a +30 modifier.

REPAIRING ARMOR
Armor may be repaired in the same manner as Dura-
bility, however, wounds do not impact the test with
modifiers or extra time.



MENTAL HEALTH
   In a time when people can discard bodies and
replace them with new ones, trauma inflicted on
your mind and ego—your sense of self—is often
more frightening than grievous physical harm. There
are many ways in which your sanity and mental
wholeness can be threatened: experiencing physical
death, extended isolation, loss of loved ones, alien
situations, discontinuity of self from lost memories
or switching morphs, psi attack, and so on. Two
methods are used to gauge your mental health: stress
points and trauma.

STRESS POINTS
Stress points represent fractures in your ego’s in-
tegrity, cracks in the mental image of yourself. This
mental damage is experienced as cerebral shocks,
disorientation, cognitive disconnects, synaptic mis-
fires, or an undermining of the intellectual faculties.
On their own, these stress points do not significantly
impair your character’s functioning, but if allowed to
accumulate they can have severe repercussions. Ad-
ditionally, any source that inflicts a large amount of
stress points at once is likely to have a more severe
impact (see Trauma).
   Stress points may be reduced by long-term rest, psy-
chiatric care, and/or psychosurgery (see p. 214).

LUCIDITY AND STRESS
Your Lucidity stat benchmarks your character’s mental
stability. If you build up an amount of stress points
equal to or greater than your Lucidity score, your char-
acter’s ego immediately suffers a mental breakdown.
You effectively go into shock and remain in a catatonic
state until your stress points are reduced to a level
below your Lucidity stat. Accumulated stress points
will overwhelm egos housed inside synthetic shells or
infomorphs just as they will biological brains—the
mental software effectively seizes up, incapable of
functioning until it is debugged.

INSANITY RATING
Extreme amounts of built-up stress points can perma-
nently damage your character’s sanity. If accumulated
stress points reach your Lucidity x 2, your character’s
ego undergoes a permanent meltdown. Your mind is
lost, and no amount of psych help or rest will ever
bring it back.
STRESS VALUE
Any source capable of inflicting cognitive stress is given
a Stress Value (SV). This indicates the amount of stress
points the attack or experience inflicts upon a character.
Like DV, SV is often presented as a variable amount, such
as 2d10, or sometimes with a modifier, such as 2d10 +
10. Simply roll the dice and total the amounts to deter-
mine the stress points inflicted in that instance. To make
things easier, a static SV is also given in parentheses after
the variable amount; use that set amount when you wish
to keep the game moving and don’t want to roll dice.

TRAUMA
Mental trauma is more severe than stress points. Trau-
mas represent severe mental shocks, a crumbling of
personality/self, delirium, paradigm shifts, and other
serious cognitive malfunctions. Traumas impair your
character’s functioning and may result in temporary
derangements or permanent disorders.
  If your character receives a number of stress points
at once that equals or exceeds their Trauma Thresh-
old, they have suffered a trauma. If the inflicted stress
points are double or triple the Trauma Threshold, they
suffer 2 or 3 traumas, respectively, and so on. Trau-
mas are cumulative and must be recorded on your
character sheet.

TRAUMA EFFECTS
Each trauma applies a cumulative –10 modifier to all
of the character’s actions. A character with 2 traumas,
for example, suffers –20 to all actions. These modifiers
are also cumulative with wound modifiers.
   Disorientation: Any time a character suffers a
trauma, they must make an immediate WIL x 3 Test.
Trauma modifiers apply. If they fail, they are tempo-
rarily stunned and disoriented, and must expend a
Complex Action to regain their wits.
   Derangements and Disorders: Any time a character
is hit with a trauma, they suffer a temporary derange-
ment (see Derangements). The first trauma inflicts a
minor derangement. If a second trauma is applied,
the first derangement is either upgraded from minor
to a moderate derangement, or else a second minor
derangement is applied (gamemaster’s discretion).
Likewise, a third trauma may upgrade that derange-
ment from moderate to major or else inflict a new
minor. It is generally recommended that derangements
be upgraded in potency, especially when result from
the same set of ongoing circumstances. In the case of
traumas that result from distinctly separate situations
and sources, separate derangements may be applied.
   Disorder: When four or more traumas have been
inflicted on a character, a major derangement is up-
graded to a disorder. Disorders represent long-lasting
psychological afflictions that typically require weeks
or even months of psychotherapy and/or psychosur-
gery to remedy (see Disorders, p. 211).

%%% txt/212.txt
DERANGEMENTS
Derangements are temporary mental conditions that
result from traumas. Derangements are measured as
Minor, Moderate, or Major. The gamemaster and
player should cooperate in choosing which derange-
ment to apply, as appropriate to the scenario and
character personality.
   Derangements last for 1d10 ÷ 2 hours (round
down), or until the character receives psychiatric help,
whichever comes first. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
a derangement may last longer if the character has not
been distanced from the source of the stress, or if they
remain embroiled in other stress-inducing situations.
   Derangement effects are meant to be role-played.
The player should incorporate the derangement into
their character’s words and actions. If the gamemaster
doesn’t feel the player is stressing the effects enough,
they can emphasize them. If the gamemaster feels it is
appropriate, they may also call for additional modi-
fiers or tests for certain actions.

ANXIETY (MINOR)
You suffer a panic attack, exhibiting the physiological
conditions of fear and worry: sweatiness, racing heart,
trembling, shortness of breath, headaches, and so on.

AVOIDANCE (MINOR)
You are psychologically incapable with dealing with
the source of the stress, or some circumstance related
to it, so you avoid it—even covering your ears, curl-
ing up in a ball, or shutting off your sensors if you
have to.

DIZZINESS (MINOR)
The stress makes you light-headed and disoriented.

ECHOLALIA (MINOR)
You involuntarily repeat words and phrases spoken
by others.

FIXATION (MINOR)
You become fixated on something that you did wrong
or some circumstance that led to your stress. You
obsess over it, repeating the behavior, trying to fix it,
running scenarios through your head and out loud,
and so on.

HUNGER (MINOR)
You are suddenly consumed by an irrational yet
overwhelming desire to eat something—perhaps even
something unusual.

INDECISIVENESS (MINOR)
You are flustered by the cause of your stress, finding it
difficult to make choices or select courses of action.

%%% txt/213.txt
LOGORRHOEA (MINOR)
Your response to the trauma is to engage in excessive
talking and babbling. You don’t shut up.

NAUSEA (MINOR)
The stress sickens you, forcing you to fight down
queasiness.

CHILLS (MODERATE)
Your body temperature rises, making you feel cold,
and shivering sets in. You just can’t get warm.

CONFUSION (MODERATE)
The trauma scrambles your concentration, making
you forget what you’re doing, mix up simple tasks,
and falter over easy decisions.

ECHOPRAXIA (MODERATE)
You involuntarily repeat and mimic the actions of
others around you.

MOOD SWINGS (MODERATE)
You lose control of your emotions. You switch from
ecstasy to tears and back to rage without warning.

MUTE (MODERATE)
The trauma shocks you into speechlessness and a com-
plete inability to effectively communicate.

NARCISSISM (MODERATE)
In the wake of the mental shock, all you can think
about is yourself. You cease caring about those around
you.

PANIC (MODERATE)
You are overwhelmed by fear or anxiety and immedi-
ately seek to distance yourself from the cause of the
stress.

TREMORS (MODERATE)
You shake violently, making it difficult to hold things
or stay still.

BLACKOUT (MAJOR)
You operate on auto-pilot in a temporary fugue state.
Later, you will be incapable of recalling what hap-
pened during this period. (Synthetic shells and info-
morphs may call up memory records from storage.)

FRENZY (MAJOR)
You have a major freak out over the source of the
stress and attack it.

HALLUCINATIONS (MAJOR)
You see, hear, or otherwise sense things that aren’t
really there.
HYSTERIA (MAJOR)
You lose control, panicking over the source of the
stress. This typically results in an emotional outburst
of crying, laughing, or irrational fear.

IRRATIONALITY (MAJOR)
You are so jarred by the stress that your capacity for
logical judgment breaks down. You are angered by
imaginary offenses, hold unreasonable expectations, or
otherwise accept things with unconvincing evidence.

PARALYSIS (MAJOR)
You are so shocked by the trauma that you are effec-
tively frozen, incapable of making decisions or taking
action.

PSYCHOSOMATIC CRIPPLING (MAJOR)
The trauma overwhelms you, impairing some part of
your physical functioning. You suffer from an inexpli-
cable blindness, deafness, or phantom pain, or are sud-
denly incapable of using a limb or other extremity.

DISORDERS
Disorders reflect more permanent madness. In this
case, “permanent” does not necessarily mean forever,
but the condition is ongoing until the character has re-
ceived lengthy and effective psychiatric help. Disorders
are inflicted whenever a character has accumulated 4
traumas. The gamemaster and player should choose a
disorder that fits the situation and character.
   Disorders are not always “active”—they may
remain dormant until triggered by certain conditions.
While it is certainly possible to act under a disorder,
it represents a severe impairment to a person’s ability
to maintain normal relationships and do a job suc-
cessfully. Disorders should not be glamorized as cute
role-playing quirks. They represent the best attempts
of a damaged psyche to deal with a world that has
failed it in some way. Additionally, people in many
habitats, particularly those in the inner system, still
regard disorders as a mark of social stigma and may
react negatively towards impaired characters.
   Characters that acquire disorders over the course
of their adventures may get rid of them in one of two
ways, either through in-game attempts to treat them
(p. 214) or by buying them off as they would a nega-
tive trait (p. 153).

ADDICTION
Addiction as a disorder can refer to any sort of addic-
tive behavior focused toward a particular behavior or
substance, to the point where the user is unable to func-
tion without the addiction but is also severely impaired
due to the effects of the addiction. It is marked by a
desire on the part of the subject to seek help or reduce
the use of the addicting substance/act, but also by the
subject spending large amounts of time in pursuit of

%%% txt/214.txt
their addiction to the exclusion of other activities. This
is a step up from Addiction negative trait listed on p.
148—this is much more of a crippling behavior that
compensates for spending time away from the addic-
tion. Addictions are typically related to the trauma
that caused the disorder (VR or drug addictions are
encouraged).
   Suggested Game Effects: The addict functions in
only two states: under the influence of their addic-
tion or in withdrawal. Additionally, they spend large
amounts of time away from their other responsibili-
ties in pursuit of their addiction.

ATAVISM
Atavism is a disorder that mainly affects uplifts. It
results in them regressing to an earlier un- or partial-
ly-uplifted state. They may exhibit behaviors more
closely in line with their more animalistic forbears, or
they may lose some of their uplift benefits such as the
ability for abstract reasoning or speech.
   Suggested Game Effects: The player and gamemas-
ter should discuss how much of the uplift’s nature is
lost and adjust game penalties accordingly. It is im-
portant to note that other uplifts view atavistic uplifts
with something akin to horror and will usually have
nothing to do with them.

ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)
This disorder manifests as a marked inability to focus
on any one task for an extended period of time, and
also an inability to notice details in most situations.
Sufferers may find themselves starting multiple tasks,
beginning a new one after only a cursory attempt at
the prior task. ADHD suffers may also have a manic
edge that manifests as confidence in their ability to get
a given job done, even though they will quickly lose
all interest in it.
   Suggested Game Effects: Perception and related
skill penalties. Increased difficulty modifiers to task
actions, particularly as the action drags on.

AUTOPHAGY
This is a disorder that usually only occurs among up-
lifted octopi. It is a form of anxiety disorder character-
ized by self-cannibalism of the limbs. Subjects afflicted
with autophagy will, under stress, begin to consume
their limbs, if at all possible, causing themselves po-
tentially serious harm.
   Suggested Game Effects: Anytime an uplifted octopi
with this disorder is placed in a stressful situation they
must make a successful WIL x 3 Test or begin to con-
sume one of their limbs.

BIPOLAR DISORDER
Bipolar disorder is also called manic depression. It is
similar to depression except for the fact that the peri-
ods of depression are interrupted by brief (a matter of
days at most) periods of mania where the subject feels
inexplicably “up” about everything with heightened
energy and a general disregard for consequences. The
depressive stages are similar in all ways to depression.
The manic stages are dangerous since the subject
will take risks, spend wildly, and generally engage in
behavior without much in the way of forethought or
potential long term consequences.
  Suggested Game Effects: Similar to depression, but
when manic the character must make a WIL x 3 Test
to not do some action that may be potentially risky.
They will also try to convince others to go along with
the idea.

BODY DYSMORPHIA
Subjects afflicted with this disorder believe that they
are so unspeakably hideous that they are unable to
interact with others or function normally for fear of
ridicule and humiliation at their appearance. They
tend to be very secretive and reluctant to seek help
because they are afraid others will think them vain—
or they may feel too embarrassed to do so. Ironi-
cally, BDD is often misunderstood as a vanity-driven
obsession, whereas it is quite the opposite; people
with BDD believe themselves to be irrevocably ugly
or defective. A similar disorder, gender identity dis-
order, where the patient is upset with their entire
sexual biology, often precipitates BDD-like feelings.
Gender identity disorder is directed specifically at
external sexually dimorphic features, which are in
constant conflict with the patient’s internal psychi-
atric gender.
   Suggested Game Effects: Because of the nature of
Eclipse Phase and the ability to swap out and modify
a body, this is a fairly common disorder. It is suggested
that players with this suffer increased or prolonged
resleeving penalties since they are unable to fully
adjust to the reality of their new morph.

BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
This disorder is marked by a general inability to fully
experience one’s self any longer. Emotional states are
variable and often marked by extremes and acting
out. Simply put, the subject feels like they are losing
their sense of self and seeks constant reassurance
from others around them, yet is not fully able to act
in an appropriate way. They may also engage in im-
pulsive behaviors in an attempt to experience some
sort of feeling. In extreme cases, there may be suicidal
thoughts or attempts.
   Suggested Game Effects: The character needs to
be around others and will not be left alone, however
they also are not quite able to relate to others in a
normal way and may also take risks or make impul-
sive decisions.

DEPRESSION
Clinical depression is characterized by intense feelings
of hopelessness and worthlessness. Subjects usually
report feeling as though nothing they do matters and
no one would care anyway, so they are disinclined to

%%% txt/215.txt
attempt much in the way of anything. The character is
depressed and finds it difficult to be motivated to do
much of anything. Even simple acts such as eating and
bathing can seem to be monumental tasks.
  Suggested Game Effect: Depressives often lack the
will to take any sort of action, often to the point of re-
quiring a WIL x 3 Test to engage in sustained activity.

FUGUE
The character enters into a fugue state where they
display little attention to external stimuli. They will
still function physiologically but refrain from speak-
ing and stare off into the distance, unable to focus on
events around them. Unlike catatonia, a person in a
fugue state will walk around if lead about by a helper,
but is otherwise unresponsive. The fugue state is usu-
ally a persistent state, but it can be an occasional state
that is triggered by some sort of external stimuli simi-
lar to the original trauma that triggered the disorder.
   Suggested Game Effects: Characters in a fugue state
are totally non-responsive to most stimuli around
them. They will not even defend themselves if at-
tacked and will usually attempt to curl into a fetal
position if physically assaulted.

GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD)
GAD results in severe feelings of anxiety about nearly
everything the character comes into contact with.
Even simple tasks represent the potential for failure
on a catastrophic scale and should be avoided or mini-
mized. Additionally, negative outcomes for any action
are always assumed to be the only possible outcomes.
  Suggested Game Effects: A character with GAD will
be almost entirely useless unless convinced otherwise,
and then only for a short period of time. Another
character can attempt to use a relevant social skill to
coax the GAD character into doing what is required
of them. If the character with the disorder fails at the
task, however, all future attempts to coax them will
suffer a cumulative –10 penalty.

HYPOCHONDRIA
Hypochondriacs suffer from a delusion that they are
sick in ways that they are not. They will create dis-
orders that they believe they suffer from, usually to
get the attention of others. Often hypochondriacs will
inflict harm on themselves or even ingest substances
that will aid in producing symptoms similar to the
disorder they believe they have. These attempts to
simulate symptoms can and will cause actual harm to
hypochondriacs.
   Possible Game Effects: A subject that is hypochon-
driac will often behave as though they are under the
effects of some other disorder or physical malady.
This can be consistent over time or can be different
and ever changing. They will react with hostility to
claims that they are faking or not actually ill.
IMPULSE CONTROL DISORDER
Subjects have a certain act or belief that they must
engage in a certain activity that comes into their
mind. This can be kleptomania, pyromania, sexual
exhibitionism, etc. They feel a sense of building
anxiety whenever they are prevented from engaging
in this behavior for an extended period (usually sev-
eral times a day to weekly, depending on the impulse)
and will often attempt to engage in this behavior at
inconvenient or inappropriate times. This is differ-
ent from OCD in the sense that OCD is usually a
single contained behavior that must be engaged in to
reduce anxiety. Impulse control disorder is a variety
of behaviors and can be virtually any sort of highly
inappropriate action.
   Suggested Game Effects: Similar to OCD, if the
player doesn’t engage in the behavior they will grow
increasingly disturbed and suffer penalties to all ac-
tions until they are able to engage in the compulsion
that alleviates their anxiety.

INSOMNIA
Insomniacs find themselves unable to sleep, or unable
to sleep for an extended period of time. This is most
often due to anxiety about their lives or as a result
of depression and the accompanying negative thought
patterns. This is not the sort of sleeplessness that is
brought about as a result of normal stress but rather
a near total inability to find rest in sleep when it is
desired. Insomniacs may find themselves nodding off
at inopportune times, but never for long, and never
enough to gain any restful sleep. As a result, they
are frequently lethargic and inattentive as their lack
of sleep robs them of their edge and eventually any
semblance of alertness. Additionally, insomniacs are
frequently irritable due to being on edge and unable
to rest.
   Suggested Game Effects: Due to the lack of mean-
ingful sleep, insomniacs should suffer from blanket
penalties to perception related tasks or anything re-
quiring concentration or prolonged fine motor abilities.

MEGALOMANIA
A megalomaniac believes themselves to be the single
most important person in the universe. Nothing is
more important than the megalomaniac and every-
thing around them must be done according to their
whim. Failure to comply with the dictates of a mega-
lomaniac can often result in rages or actual physical
assaults by the subject.
  Suggested Game Effects: A character that has
megalomania will demand attention and has diffi-
culty in nearly any social situation. Additionally, they
may be provoked to violence if they think they are
being slighted.

%%% txt/216.txt
MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER
This is the development of a separate, distinct per-
sonality from the original or control personality.
The personalities may or may not be aware of each
other and “conscious” during the actions of the other
personality. Usually there is some sort of trigger that
results in the emergence of the non-control personality.
Most subjects have only a single extra personality, but
it is not unheard of to have several personalities. It
is important to note that these are distinct individual
personalities and not just crude caricatures of the Dr.
Jekyll/Mr. Hyde sort. Each personality sees itself as
a distinct person with their own wants, needs, and
motivations. Additionally, they are usually unaware
of the experiences of the others, though there is some
basic information sharing (such as language and core
skill sets).
   Suggested Game Effects: When the player is under
the effects of another personality, they should be
treated as an NPC. In some rare cases the player and
the gamemaster can work out the second personality
and allow the player to roleplay this. This does not
however constitute an entire new character that can
be “turned on” at will.

OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)
Subjects with OCD are marked by intrusive or in-
appropriate thoughts or impulses that cause acute
anxiety if a particular obsession or compulsion is not
engaged in to alleviate them. These obsessions and
compulsions can be nearly any sort of behavior that
must be immediately engaged in to keep the rising
anxiety at bay. Players and gamemasters are encour-
aged to come up with a behavior that is suitable.
Examples of common behaviors include repetitive
tics (touching every finger of each hand to another
part of the body, tapping the right foot twenty times),
pathological behaviors such as gambling or eating,
or a mental ritual that must be completed (reciting a
book passage).
   Suggested Game Effects: If the player doesn’t
engage in the behavior they will grow increasingly
disturbed and suffer penalties to all actions until they
are able to engage in the compulsion that alleviates
their anxiety.

POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
PTSD occurs as a result of being exposed to either
a single incident or a series of incidents where the
sufferer had their own life, or saw the lives of others,
threatened with death. These incidents are often
marked by an inability on the part of the victim, either
real or perceived, to do anything to alter the outcomes.
As a result, they develop an acute anxiety and fixation
on these incidents to the point where they lose sleep,
become irritated or easily angered, or are depressed
over feelings that they lack control in their own lives.
   Suggested Game Effects: Penalties to task actions,
also treat situations similar to the initial episodes that
caused the disorder as a phobia.
SCHIZOPHRENIA
While schizophrenia is generally acknowledged as a
genetic disorder that has an onset in early adulthood,
it also seems to develop in a number of egos that un-
dergo frequent morph changes. It has been theorized
that this is due to some sort of repetitive error in the
download process. Regardless, it remains a rare, yet
persistent danger of dying and being brought back.
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder where the sub-
ject loses their ability to discern reality from unreality.
This can involve delusions, hallucinations (often in
support of the delusions), and fragmented or disor-
ganized speech. The subject will not be aware of these
behaviors and will perceive themselves as functioning
normally, often to the point of becoming paranoid that
others are somehow involved in a grand deception.
   Suggested Game Effects: Schizophrenia represents
a total break from reality. A character that is schizo-
phrenic may see and hear things and act on those
delusions and hallucinations while seeing attempts
by their friends to stop or explain to them as part of
a wider conspiracy. Adding to this is the difficulty of
communicating coherently. Players that have become
schizophrenic are only marginally functional and
only for short periods of time until they have the
disorder treated.

STRESSFUL SITUATIONS
The universe of Eclipse Phase is ripe with experiences
that might rattle a character’s sanity. Some of these are
as mundane and human as extreme violence, extended
isolation, or helplessness. Others are less common, but
even more terrifying: encountering alien species, infec-
tion by the Exsurgent virus, or being sleeved inside a
non-human morph.

WILLPOWER STRESS TESTS
Whenever a character encounters a situation that
might impact their ego’s psyche, the gamemaster may
call for a (Willpower x 3) Test. This test determines if
the character is able to cope with the unnerving situa-
tion or if the experience scars their mental landscape.
If they succeed, the character is shaken but otherwise
unaffected. If they fail, they suffer stress damage (and
possibly trauma) as appropriate to the situation. A
list of stress-inducing scenarios and suggested SVs are
listed on the Stressful Experiences table, p. 215. The
gamemaster should use these as a guideline, modifying
them as appropriate to the situation at hand.
   Note that some incidents may be so horrific that a
modifier is applied to the character’s (Willpower x 3)
Test.

HARDENING
The more you are exposed to horrible or terrifying
things, the less scary they become. After repeated ex-
posure, you become hardened to such things, able to
shake them off without effect.

    Every time you succeed in a Willpower Test to avoid
 taking stress from a particular source, take note. If you
 successfully resist such a situation 5 times, you become
 effectively immune to taking stress from that source.
    The drawback to hardening yourself to such situa-
 tions is that you grow detached and callous. In order
 to protect yourself, you have learned to cut off your
 emotions—but it is such emotions that make you
 human. You have erected mental walls that will affect
 your empathy and ability to relate to others.
    Each time you harden yourself to one source of
 stress, your maximum Moxie stat is reduced by 1.
 Psychotherapy may be used to overcome such harden-
 ing, in the same way a disorder is treated.

 MENTAL HEALING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
 Stress is trickier to heal than physical damage. There
 are no nano-treatments or quick fix options (other
 than killing yourself and reverting to a non-stressed
 backup). The options for recuperating are simply natu-
 ral healing over time, psychotherapy, or psychosurgery.
                PSYCHOTHERAPY CARE

                Medicine: Psychiatry, Academics: Psychol-

                 or trauma with psychotherapy. This treat-

                 ment is a long-term process, involving

0                chosurgery (p. 229). AIs skilled in psycho-
und down)        therapy are also available.
                    Psychotherapy is a task action, with a
+2
                 timeframe of 1 hour per point of stress,
+5              8 hours per trauma, and 40 hours per
0                disorder. Note that this only counts the
+2               time actually spent in psychotherapy with
+3               a skilled professional. After each psycho-

                 surgery adds a +30 modifier to this test; at

und down)       Traumas may not be healed until all stress

+3                  When a trauma is healed, the derange-
 p. 366          ment associated with that trauma is
+2               eliminated or downgraded. Disorders are
                 treated separately from the trauma that
                 caused them, and may only be treated
                when all other traumas are removed.
      Gamemaster and players are encouraged to roleplay
    a character’s suffering and relief from traumas and
    disorders. Each is an experience that makes a profound
    impact on a character’s personality and psyche. The
    process of treatment may also change them, so in the
    end they may be a transformed from the person they
    once were. Even if treated, the scars are likely to remain
    for some time to come. According to some opinions,
    disorders are never truly eradicated, they are just eased
    into submission ... where they may linger beneath the
    surface, waiting for some trauma to come along.

   NATURAL HEALING
   Characters who eschew psychotherapy can hopefully
   work out the problems in their head on their own over
   time. For every month that passes without accruing
   new stress, the character may make a WIL x 3 Test. If
   successful, they heal 1d10 points of stress or 1 trauma
   (all stress must be healed first). Disorders are even more
   difficult to heal, requiring 3 months without stress or
   trauma, and even then only being eliminated with a
   successful WIL Test. As a result, disorders can linger
   for years until resolved with actual psychotherapy.

MIND HACKS■MIND HACKS■MIND HAC



 HACKS
  Though neuroscience has ascended to impressive
  pinnacles, allowing minds to be thoroughly scanned,
  mapped, and emulated as software, the transhuman
  brain remains a place that is complicated, not fully
  understood, and thoroughly messy. Despite a preva-
  lence of neural modifications, meddling with the seat
  of consciousness remains a tricky and hazardous
  procedure. Nevertheless, psychosurgery—editing the
  mind as software—remains common and widespread,
  sometimes with unexpected results.
     Likewise, even as the knowledge of neuroscientists
  grows on an exponential basis, some are discovering
  that minds are far more mysterious than they had ever
  imagined. During the Fall, scattered reports of “anom-
  alous activity” by individuals infected by one of the
  numerous circulating nanoplagues were discounted
  as fear and paranoia, but subsequent investigations
  by black budget labs has proven otherwise. Now, top-
  level confidential networks whisper that this infection
  inflicts intricate changes in the victim’s neural network
  that imbue them with strange and inexplicable abili-
  ties. The exact mechanism and nature of these abilities
  remains unexplained and outside the grasp of modern
  transhuman science. Given the evidence of a new
  brainwave type and the paranormal nature of this
  phenomenon, it is loosely referred to as “psi.”



  PSI
  In Eclipse Phase, psi is considered a special cognitive
  condition resulting from infection by the mutant—and
  hopefully otherwise benign—Watts-Macleod strain
  of the Exsurgent virus (p. 367). This plague modifies
  the victim’s mind, conferring special abilities. These
  abilities are inherent to the brain’s architecture and
  are copied when the mind is uploaded, allowing the
  character to retain their psi abilities when changing
  from morph to morph.

  PREREQUISITES
  To wield psi, a character must acquire the Psi trait (p.
  147) during character creation. It is theoretically also
  possible to acquire the use of psi in game via infec-
  tion by the Watts-MacLeod strain; see The Exsurgent
  Virus, p. 362.
     Psi ability is considered an innate ability of the
  ego and not a biological or genetic predisposition of
  the morph. While psi researchers do not understand
  how it is possible to transfer this ability via uploads,
  backups, and farcasting, it has been speculated that
  all components of an async’s ego are entangled on a
  quantum level, or that they possess the ability to en-
  tangle themselves or form a unique conformation or
  alignment as a whole even after they have been copied,
  up-, or downloaded. This speculated entanglement
■MIND HACKS■MIND HACKS■MIND H

 process is also thought to be the origin of the impair-
 ment that asyncs experience when adapting to a new
 morph (see below).

 MORPHS AND PSI
 Asyncs require a biological brain to draw on their
 abilities (the brains of uplifted animals count). An
 async whose ego is downloaded into an infomorph or
 fully computerized brain (synthmorphs) has no access
 to their abilities as long they remain in that morph.
   Asyncs inhabiting a pod morph may use psi, but
 their abilities are restricted as pod brains are only
 partly biological. Pod-morphed asyncs suffer a –30
 modifier on all tests involving the use of psi sleights
 and the impact from using sleights would be doubled.

 MORPH ACCLIMATIZATION
 Async minds undergo extra difficulty adjusting to new
 morphs. For 1 day after the character has resleeved,
 they will suffer the effects of a single derangement
 (p. 210). The gamemaster and player should choose a
 derangement appropriate to the character and story.
 Minor derangements are recommended, but at the
 gamemaster’s discretion moderate or major derange-
 ments may be applied. No trauma is inflicted with
 this derangement.

 MORPH FEVER
 Asyncs find it irritating and traumatizing to endure life
 as an infomorph, pod, or synthmorph for long periods
 of time. This phenomenon, known as morph fever,
 might cause temporary derangements and trauma to
 the asyncs’ ego, possibly even to the grade of perma-
 nent disorders. If stored or held captive as an active
 infomorph (i.e. not in virtual stasis), the async might
 go insane if not psychologically aided by some sort of
 anodyne program or supporting person during storage.
   In game terms, asyncs take 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up)
 points of mental stress damage per month they stay
 in a pod, synthmorph or infomorph form without
 psychological assistance by a psychiatrist, software,
 or muse.

 PSI DRAWBACKS
 There are several drawbacks to psi ability:

• The variant Exsurgent strain that endows psi ability
  rewires the character’s brain. An unfortunate side
  effect to this change is that asyncs acquire a vulner-
  ability to mental stress. Reduce the async’s Trauma
  Threshold by 1.
• The mental instability that accompanies psi infec-
  tion also tends to unhinge the character’s mind.
  Asyncs acquires one Mental Disorder negative trait
  (p. 150) for each level they have of the Psi trait

%%% txt/223.txt
  without receiving any bonus CP. The gamemaster
  and player should agree on a disorder appropriate
  to the character. This disorder may be treated over
  time, according to normal rules (see Mental Healing
  and Psychotherapy, p. 215).
• Characters with the Psi trait are also vulnerable to
  infection by other strains of the Exsurgent virus.
  The character suffers a –20 modifier when resisting
  Exsurgent infection (p. 362).
• Critical failures when using psi tend to stress the
  async’s mind. Each time a critical failure is rolled
  when making a sleight-related test, the async suffers
  a temporary brain seizure. They suffer a –30 modi-
  fier and are incapable of acting until the end of the
  next Action Turn. They must also succeed in a WIL
  + COG Test or fall down.

PSI SKILLS AND SLEIGHTS
Transhuman psi users can manipulate their egos and
otherwise create effects that can often be neither
matched nor mimicked by technological means. To use
these abilities, they train their mental processes and
practice cognitive algorithms called sleights, which
they can subconsciously recall and use as necessary.
Sleights fall into two categories: psi-chi (cognitive
enhancements, p. 223) and psi-gamma (brainwave
reading and manipulation, p. 225). Psi-chi sleights are
available to anyone with the Psi trait (p. 147), but psi-
gamma sleights are only available to characters with
the Psi trait at Level 2. In order to use these sleights,
the async must be skilled in the Control (p. 178), Psi
Assault (p. 183), and/or Sense skills (p. 184), as ap-
propriate to each sleight.

ROLEPLAYING ASYNCS
Any player who chooses to play an async should keep
the origin of their abilities in mind: Watts-MacLeod
strain infection. The character may not be aware of
this source, but they undoubtedly know that they un-
derwent some sort of transformation and have talents
that no one else does. If unaware of the infection, they
have likely learned to keep their abilities secret lest
they be ridiculed, attacked, or whisked away to some
secret testing program. Learning the truth about their
nature could even be the starting point of a campaign
and/or their introduction to Firewall. If they know the
truth, however, the character must live with the fact
that they are the victim of a nanoplague likely spread
by the TITANs that may or may not lead to complica-
tions, side effects, or other unexpected revelations in
their future.
   Gamemasters and players should make an effort
to explore the nature of this infection and how the
character perceives it. As noted previously, asyncs are
often profoundly-changed people. The invasive and
alien aspect of their abilities should not be lost on
them. For example, an async might conceive of their
psi talents as a sort of parasitic entity, living off their
sleights, or they might feel that using these powers
puts them in touch with some sort of fundamental
substrate of the universe that is weird and terrifying.
Alternately, they could feel as if their personality was
melded with something different, something that
doesn’t belong. Each async is likely to view their situ-
ation differently, and none of them pleasantly.

USING PSI
Using psi—i.e., drawing on a certain sleight to pro-
cure some kind of effect—does not always require a
test. Each sleight description details how the power
is used.

ACTIVE PSI
Active psi sleights must be “activated” to be used.
These sleights usually require a skill test. Sleights that
target other sentient beings or life forms are always
Opposed Tests, while others are handled as Success
Tests. The level of concentration required to use these
sleights varies, and so may call for a Quick, Complex,
or Task Action. Active sleights also cause strain (p.
223) to the async. Most psi-gamma sleights fall into
this category.

PASSIVE PSI
Passive psi sleights encompasses abilities that are con-
sidered automatically active and subconscious. They
rarely require an action to be activated and require
no effort or strain by the psi user. Passive sleights typi-
cally add bonuses to various activities or allow access
to certain abilities rather than calling for some kind of
skill test. Most psi-chi sleights fall into this category.

PSI RANGE
Sleights have a Range of either Self, Touch, or Close.
   Self: These sleights only affect the async.
  Touch: Sleights with a Touch range may be used
against other biological life, but the async must have
physical contact with the target. If the target avoids
being touched, this requires a successful melee attack,
applying the touch-only +20 modifier. This attack
does not cause damage, and is considered part of the
same action as the psi use.
   Close: Close sleights involve interaction with other
biological life from a short distance. The optimal dis-
tance is within 5 meters. For each meter beyond that,
apply a –10 modifier to the test.
   Psi vs. Psi: Due to the nature of psi, sleights are
more effective against other psi users. Sleights with
a range of Touch may be used from a Close range
against another async. Likewise, a sleight with a Close
range may be used at twice the normal distance (10
meters) when wielded on another async.

TARGETING
Synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles may not be targeted
by psi sleights, as they lack biological brains. Pods—
with brains that are half biological and half com-
puter—are less susceptible and receive a +30 modifier

%%% txt/224.txt
when defending against psi use. Note that infomorphs
may never be targeted by psi sleights as psi is not ef-
fective within the mesh or simulspace.
   Multiple Targets: An async may target more than
one character with a sleight with the same action, as
long as each of them can be targeted via the rules
above. The psi character only rolls once, with each of
the defending characters making their Opposed Tests
against that roll. The psi character suffers strain (p.
223) for each target, however, meaning that using psi
on multiple targets can be extremely dangerous.
   Animals and Less Complex Life Forms: Psi works
against any living creature with a brain and/or
nervous system. Against partially-sentient and par-
tially-uplifted animals, it suffers a –20 modifier and
increases strain by +1. Against non-sentient animals,
it suffers a –30 modifier and increases strain by +3. It
has no effect on or against less complex life forms like
plants, algae, bacteria, etc.
   Factors and Aliens: At the gamemaster’s discretion,
psi sleights may not work on alien creatures at all, de-
pending on their physiology and neurology. If it does
work, it is likely to suffer at least a –20 modifier and
+1 strain.

OPPOSED TESTS
Psi that is used against another character is resisted
with an Opposed Test. Defending characters resist with
WIL x 2. Willing characters may choose not to resist.
Unconscious or sleeping characters cannot resist.
   If the psi-wielding character succeeds and the de-
fender fails, the sleight affects the target. If the psi user
fails, the defender is unscathed. If both parties suc-
ceed in their tests, compare their dice rolls. If the psi
user’s roll is higher, the sleight bypasses the defender’s
mental block and affects the target; otherwise, the
sleight fails to affect the defender’s ego.

TARGET AWARENESS
The target of a psi sleight is aware they are being
targeted any time they succeed on their half of the
Opposed Test (regardless on whether the async
rolls higher or not). Note that awareness does not
necessarily mean that the target understands that psi
abilities are being used on them, especially as most
people in Eclipse Phase are unaware of psi’s existence.
Instead, the target is simply likely to understand that
some outside influence is at work, or that something
strange is happening. They may suspect that they
have been drugged or are under the influence of some
strange technology.
  Targets who fail their roll remain unaware.

PSI FULL DEFENSE
Like full defense in physical combat (p. 198), a de-
fender may spend a Complex Action to rally and con-
centrate their mental defenses, gaining a +30 modifier
to their defense test against psi use until their next
Action Phase.

%%% txt/225.txt
CRITICALS
If the defender rolls a critical success, the character
attempting to wield psi is temporarily locked out of
the target’s mind. The psi user may not target that
character with sleights until an appropriate “reset”
period has passed, determined by the gamemaster.
   If the async rolls a critical failure, they suffer tempo-
rary incapacitation as their mind dysfunctions in some
harsh and distressing ways (see Psi Drawbacks, p. 221).
   If a psi user rolls a critical success against a de-
fender, or the defender rolls a critical failure, double
the potency of the sleight’s effect. In the case of psi at-
tacks, the DV can be doubled or mental armor can be
bypassed. Alternately, when using Psi Assault (p. 183),
the targeted character may be in danger of infection
by the Watts-Macleod strain (p. 362).

MENTAL ARMOR
The Psi Shield sleight (p. 228) provides mental armor,
a form of neural hardening against psi-based attacks.
Like physical armor, this mental armor reduces the
amount of damage inflicted by a psi assault.

DURATION
Psi sleights have one of four durations: constant, in-
stant, temporary, or sustained.
   Constant: Constant sleights are always “on.”
   Instant: Instant sleights take effect only in the
Action Phase in which they are used.
   Temporary: Temporary sleights last for a limited
duration with no extra effort from the async. The
temporary duration is determined by the async’s WIL
÷ 5 (round up) and is measured in either Action Turns
or minutes, as noted. Strain for the sleight is applied
immediately when used, not at the end of the duration.
   Sustained: Sustained sleights require active effort
to maintain for as long as the async wants to keep
it active. Sustaining a sleight requires concentration,
and so the async suffers a –10 modifier to all other
skill tests while the sleight is sustained. The async
must also stay within the range appropriate to the
sleight, otherwise the sleight immediately ends. More
than one sleight may be sustained at a time, with a
cumulative modifier. Strain for the sleight is applied
immediately when used, not at the end of the dura-
tion. At the gamemaster’s discretion, sleights that are
sustained for long periods may incur additional strain.

STRAIN
The use of psi is physically (and sometimes psycho-
logically) draining to a psi user. This phenomenon is
known as strain, and manifests as fatigue, exhaustion,
pain, neural overload, cardiovascular stress, and
adynamia (loss of vigor). Though strain has only
rarely been known to actually kill an async, the use
of too much active psi can be life-threatening in some
circumstances.
   In game terms, every active sleight has a Strain
Value of 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) DV. Every active sleight
lists a Strain Value Modifier that modifies this amount.
For example, a sleights with a Strain Value Modifier
of –1 inflicts (1d10 ÷ 2) –1 DV.
   If the damage points suffered from strain exceed
the character’s Wound Threshold, they may inflict a
wound just like other damage (see Wounds, p. 207).


           Matric is investigating a disappearance, so he
           decides to use his Qualia sleight to boost his
           Intuition while hunting for clues. That psi-chi
           sleight takes only a Quick Action to initiate and
           requires no test. Matric’s WIL is 25, so the dura-
           tion of this temporary sleight is 5 Action Turns (25
           ÷ 5 = 5). The sleight’s Strain modifier is –1, so
           he is facing (1d10 ÷ 2) –1 DV. He rolls a 1, so he
           takes no strain at all!
              Later on, Matric finds himself in a life-or-death
           struggle with a kidnapper. Lucky for Matric,
           they’re in a melee, so he’s close enough to try
 EXAMPLE




           and touch his opponent. On his Action Phase, he
           makes an Unarmed Combat Test with a +20 mod-
           ifier (for a touch-only attack) and succeeds. This
           allows him to try and use his Psychic Stab sleight.
           He rolls his Psi Assault of 57 against the target’s
           WIL x 2 (32). His target is in a worker pod morph,
           however, which is less susceptible to psi, so he
           receives a +30 modifier (32 + 30 = 62). Matric
           rolls a 32 and the worker pod a 64—Matric wins!
           For damage, he rolls 1d10 + (WIL ÷ 10). His WIL
           is 25, so that’s 1d10 + 3. He rolls a score a 7 and
           inﬂicts 10 (7 + 3) points of damage. The worker
           pod screams in pain, suffering a wound from the
           psychic assault.


PSI-CHI SLEIGHTS
Psi-chi sleights are async abilities that speed up cogni-
tive informatics (internal information processing) and
enhance the user’s perception and cognition.

AMBIENCE SENSE
       PSI TYPE:    Passive        ACTION:    Automatic
   RANGE:      Self        DURATION: Constant
This sleight provides the async with an instinctive
sense about an area and any potential threats nearby.
The async receives a +10 modifier to all Investigation,
Perception, Scrounging, and Surprise Tests.

COGNITIVE BOOST
       PSI TYPE:    Active         ACTION:    Quick
       RANGE:       Self           DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: –1
The async can temporarily elevate their cognitive
performance. In game terms, Cognition is raised by 5
for the chosen duration. This boost to Cognition also
raises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.

%%% txt/226.txt
DOWNTIME
  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Task (min. 4 hours)
  RANGE:      Self          DURATION:   Sustained
  STRAIN MOD: 0
This sleight provides the async with the ability
to send the mind into a fugue-state regenerative
downtime, during which the character’s psyche is
repaired. The async must enter the downtime for
at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals
1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements,
and disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For
all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during
downtime, completely oblivious to the outside
world. Only severe disturbances or physical shock
(such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon)
will bring the async out of it.

EMOTION CONTROL
  PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
  RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Constant
Emotion Control gives the async tight control
over their emotional states. Unwanted emotions
can be blocked out and others embraced. This has
the benefit of protecting the async from emotional
manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight or
Intimidation skill tests. The async receives a +30
modifier when defending against such tests.

ENHANCED CREATIVITY
  PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
  RANGE:     Self         DURATION: Constant
An async with Enhanced Creativity is more imagi-
native and more inclined to think outside the box.
Apply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativ-
ity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity can
sometimes seem strange and different, manifesting
in odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork.

  PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
  RANGE:       Self         DURATION: Constant
Filter allows the async to filter out out distractions
and eliminate negative situational modifiers from
distraction, up to the gamemaster’s discretion.

GROK
  PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
  RANGE:      Self          DURATION:   Instant
  STRAIN MOD: –1
By using the Grok sleight, the async is able to
intuitively understand how any unfamiliar object,
vehicle, or device is used simply by looking at and
handling it. If the character succeeds in a COG x 2
Test, they achieve a basic ability to use the object,
vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre.
This sleight does not provide any understanding of
the principles or technologies involved—the psi user
simply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called
for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the
device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices,
and/or tests the character is defaulting on—it does not
apply to devices the character is familiar with).

HIGH PAIN THRESHOLD
   PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic
   RANGE:       Self        DURATION: Constant
This sleight allows the async to block out, ignore, or
otherwise isolate pain. The async reduces negative
modifiers from wounds by 10.

HYPERTHYMESIA
   PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic
    RANGE:      Self         DURATION: Constant
Hyperthymesia grants the async a superior auto-
biographical memory, allowing them to remember the
most trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be
asked a random date and recall the day of the week
it was, the events that occurred that day, what the
weather was like, and many seemingly trivial details
that most people would not be able to recall.

INSTINCT
   PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic
    RANGE:      Self        DURATION: Constant
Instinct bolsters the async’s subconscious ability to
gauge a situation and make a snap judgment that
is just as accurate as a careful, considered decision.
For Task Actions that involve analysis or planning
alone (typically Mental skill actions), the async may
reduce the timeframe by 90% without suffering a
modifier. For Task Actions that involve partial analy-
sis/planning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30%
without penalty.

MULTITASKING
   PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic
   RANGE:     Self         DURATION: Constant
The async can handle vast amounts of information
without overload and can perform more than one
mental task at once. The character receives an extra
Complex Action each Action Phase that may only be
used for mental or mesh actions.

PATTERN RECOGNITION
   PSI TYPE:   Passive      ACTION:   Automatic
    RANGE:     Self         DURATION: Constant
The character is adept at spotting patterns and corre-
lating the non-random elements of a jumble—related
items jump out at them. This is useful for translating
languages, breaking codes, or find clues hidden among
massive amounts of data. The character must have

%%% txt/227.txt
a sufficiently large sample enough time to study, as
determined by the gamemaster. This might range from
a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman lan-
guage to a few days of investigating inscriptions left
by long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching
a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by
reading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a
+20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investiga-
tion, Research, or cod-breaking Tests (note that this
does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to
decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to
more easily learn new languages, reducing the training
time by half.

PREDICTIVE BOOST
   PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:    Automatic
    RANGE:     Self        DURATION: Constant
The Bayesian probability machine features of the
async’s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing
their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of
events around them as they unfold in real-time and
update those predictions as information changes.
In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense
for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the
character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve
predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters
the async’s decision-making in combat situations by
making the best course of action more clear, and so
provides a +10 bonus to both Initiative and Fray Tests.

QUALIA
   PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Quick
   RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: –1
The async can temporarily increase their intuitive
grasp of things. In game terms, Intuition is raised by
5 for the chosen duration. This boost to Intuition also
raises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.

SAVANT CALCULATION
   PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:    Automatic
     RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Constant
The character possesses an incredible facility with
intuitive mathematics. They can do everything from
calculate the odds exactly when gambling to predict-
ing precisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land
by observing the landscape and local wind currents.
The character specializes in calculation involving the
activity of complex chaotic systems and so can calcu-
late answers that even the fastest computers could not,
including things like patterns of rubble distribution
from an explosion. However, this mathematic facility
is largely intuitive, so the character does not know the
equations they are solving, they merely know the solu-
tion to the problem.
   This sleight also provides a +30 modifier to any
skill tests involving math (which the character is cal-
culating, not a computer).
SENSORY BOOST
   PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Quick
   RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: –2
An async uses this sleight to increase their natural or
augmented sensory perception (sight, audio, smell,
augmented) by enhanced cerebral processing, grant-
ing a +20 bonus modifier on sensory-based Perception
Tests.

SUPERIOR KINESICS
   PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:    Automatic
    RANGE:     Self          DURATION: Constant
The async acquires more insight into people’s emo-
tive signals, gestures, facial expressions, and body
language when it comes time to predict the person’s
emotional state, intent, or reactions. Apply a +10
modifier to Kinesics Skill Tests.

TIME SENSE
   PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Automatic
   RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: –1
An async with this ability can slow down his per-
ception of time, making everything appear to move
in slow motion or at reduced speed. In game terms,
this sleight grants the async a Speed of +1. This extra
Action Phase, however, can only be spent on mental
and mesh actions.

UNCONSCIOUS LEAD
   PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:    Automatic
   RANGE:      Self          DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: +0
This sleight allows the async to override their con-
sciousness and let their unconscious mind take point.
While in this state, the async’s conscious mind is only
dimly aware of what is transgressing, and any memo-
ries of this period will be hazy at best. The advantage
is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and
so the async’s Speed is boosted by +1. The character
remains aware and active, but is incapable of com-
plex communication or other mental actions and is
motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than
conscious thought. Though it is recommended that
the player retain control of their character while using
Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to
direct the character’s actions as they see fit.

PSI-GAMMA SLEIGHTS
  Psi-gamma sleights deal with contacting (reading
and communicating) and influencing the function of
biological minds (egos within a biomorph, but also
including animal life). Psi-gamma is only available to
characters with Level 2 of the Psi trait.
  Most psi-gamma use is handled as an Opposed Test
between the async and the target (p. 222).

ALIENATION
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)
    STRAIN MOD: +0             SKILL:    Psi Assault
Alienation is an offensive sleight that create a sense of
disconnection between an ego and its morph—similar
to that experienced when resleeved into a new body.
The ego finds their body cumbersome, strange, and
alien, almost like they are a prisoner within it. If the
async beats the target in an Opposed Test, treat the
test as a failed Integration Test (p. 272) for the target.
This effect lasts for the sleight’s duration.

CHARISMA
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Quick
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Minutes)
    STRAIN MOD: –1           SKILL:   Control
The async uses this sleight to influence the target’s
mind on a subconscious level, so that the target per-
ceives them to be charming, magnetic, and persuasive.
If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they
gain a +30 modifier on all subsequent Social Skill
Tests for the chosen duration.

CLOUD MEMORY
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Minutes)
    STRAIN MOD: –1             SKILL:   Control
Cloud Memory allows the async to temporarily dis-
rupt the target’s ability to form long-term memories. If
the async wins the Opposed Test, the target’s memory-
saving ability is negated for the duration. The target
will retain short-term memories during this time, but
will soon forget anything that occurred while this
sleight was in effect.

DEEP SCAN
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: +1            SKILL:    Sense
Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought
Browse (p. 228), made to extract information from the
targeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the
async telepathically invades the target’s mind and can
probe it for information. For every 10 full points of MoS
the async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece
of information. Each item takes one full Action Turn to
retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The
target is aware of this mental probing, though they will
not know what information the async acquired.

DRIVE EMOTION
   PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:        Touch       DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)
    STRAIN MOD: –1            SKILL:   Control
This sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas
of the target’s brain related to emotion. This allows
the async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific
emotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async
beats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in ac-
cordance with the emotion for the duration and under
certain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties
(up to +/–30), as determined by the gamemaster. For
example, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation
Test modifier against a target imbued with fear.

EGO SENSE
   PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:        Close       DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)
     STRAIN MOD: –1           SKILL:   Sense
Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and
location of other sentient and biological life forms
(i.e., egos) within the async’s range. To detect these
life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, op-
posed by each life form within range. The async may
suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and
insects, similar to the modifier applied for target-
ing them in ranged combat (see p. 193); likewise, a
modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be
applied. If successful, the async has detected that the
life form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will
ascertain another piece of information regarding the
detected life: direction from async, approximate size,
type of creature, distance from async, etc. The async
will know if the target moves, if they do so during the
sleight’s duration.

EMPATHIC SCAN
   PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Quick
   RANGE:        Close       DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: –2             SKILL:    Sense
Empathic Scan enables the async to sense the target’s
base emotions. If the async wins the Opposed Test,
they intuitively feel the target’s emotional current state
for as long as the sleight is sustained. At the gamemas-
ter’s discretion, this knowledge may provide a modifier
(up to +30) for certain Social skill tests.

IMPLANT MEMORY
   PSI TYPE:     Active      ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:        Touch       DURATION:   Instant
   STRAIN MOD:   +0          SKILL:      Control

%%% txt/229.txt
An async using this sleight can implant a memory
of up to an hour’s length inside the target’s mind.
This memory very obviously does not belong to the
target—there is no way they will confuse it for one
of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but
to place one of the async’s memories in the target’s
mind so that the target can access it just like any other
memory. This can be useful for “archiving” important
data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspec-
tive, or simply making a “data dump” for the target
to peruse. Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test
against unwilling participants. At the gamemaster’s
discretion, particularly traumatic memories might
inflict mental stress on the recipient (p. 215).

IMPLANT SKILL
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

     STRAIN MOD: +0          SKILL:   Control
Similar to Implant Memory, this sleight allows the
async to impart some of their expertise and implant it
into the target’s mind. For the duration of the sleight,
the target benefits when using that skill. If the async’s
skill is between 31 and 60, the target receives a +10
bonus. If the async’s skill is 61+, the target receives
a +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test
against unwilling participants. In some cases, the
target has been known to use the skill with the async’s
flair and mannerisms.

MIMIC
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Quick
    RANGE:      Close        DURATION:   Instant
   STRAIN MOD: +0         SKILL:   Sense
In a setting where changing your body and face is
not unusual, people learn to recognize habits and
personality quirks more often. The async must use
this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test.
If successful, the async acquires an “imprint” of the
target’s mind that they can take advantage of when
impersonating that ego. The async then receives a +30
bonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the
target’s behavior and social cues.

MINDLINK
   PSI TYPE:     Active                 ACTION:     Quick
   RANGE:        Touch                  DURATION:   Sustained
   STRAIN MOD:                SKILL:
                 +1/target after first  Control
Mindlink allows two-way mental communication
with a target. This may be used on more than one
target simultaneously, in which case the async can act
as a telepathic “server,” so that everyone mindlinked
with the async may also telepathically communicate
with each other (via the async, however, so they
overhear). Language is still a factor in mindlinked
communications, but this barrier may be overcome by
transmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sen-
sations. Mindlink requires an Opposed Test against
unwilling participants.

OMNI AWARENESS
   PSI TYPE:     Active                 ACTION:     Quick
   RANGE:        Close                  DURATION: Temp (Minutes)

    STRAIN MOD: –1           SKILL:    Sense
An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to
other biological life that is observing them. During
this sleight’s duration, the async makes a Sense Test
that is opposed by any life that has focused their at-
tention on them within the sleight’s range; if success-
ful, the async knows they are being watched, but not
by whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Per-
ception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does
not register partial attention or fleeting attention, or
simple perception of the async, it only notices targets

%%% txt/230.txt
who are actively observing (even if they are concealing
their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a
tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.

PENETRATION
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Quick
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Instant
     STRAIN MOD: 1 per AP point SKILL:  Psi Assault
Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with
any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill.
It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an op-
ponent by concentrating their psi attack. Every point
of Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts
1 point of strain. The maximum AP that may be ap-
plied equals the async’s Psi Assault skill divided by 10
(round down).

PSI SHIELD
    PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
    RANGE:      Self         DURATION: Constant
Psi Shield bolsters the async’s mind to psi attack and
manipulation. If the async is hit by a psi attack, they
receive WIL ÷ 5 (round up) points of armor, reducing
the amount of damage inflicted. They also receive a
+10 modifier when resisting any other sleights.

PSYCHIC STAB
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION:   Instant
    STRAIN MOD: +0           SKILL:    Psi Assault
Psychic Stab is an offensive sleight that seeks to inflict
physical damage on the target’s brain and nervous
system. Each successful attack inflicts 1d10 + (WIL ÷
10, round up) damage. Increase the damage by +5 if
an Excellent Success is scored.

SCRAMBLE
    PSI TYPE:   Passive       ACTION:     Automatic
   RANGE:      Self       DURATION: Constant
Scramble allows the async using the sleight to hide
from another async using the Ego Sense or Omni
Awareness sleights. Apply a +30 modifier to the de-
fending async’s Opposed Test.

SENSE BLOCK
    PSI TYPE:   Active        ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch         DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

    STRAIN MOD: –1            SKILL:   Psi Assault
Sense Block disables and short circuits one of the tar-
get’s sensory cortices (chosen by the async), interfering
with and possibly negating a specific source of sensory
input for the chosen duration. If the async beats the
target in the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –30
modifier to Perception Tests with that sense equal (dou-
bled to –60 if the async scores an Excellent Success).
SPAM
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION: Temp (Action Turns)

     STRAIN MOD: +0            SKILL:    Psi Assault
The sleight allows the async to overload and flood one
of the target’s sensory cortices (chosen by the async),
 spamming them with confusing and distracting sen-
 sory input and thereby impairing them. If the async
wins the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –10 modi-
fier to all tests the duration of the sleight (doubled to
–20 if the async scores an Excellent Success).

STATIC
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Close        DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: +0           SKILL:    None
The async generates an anti-psi jamming field, imped-
ing any use of ranged sleights within their range. All
such ranged sleights suffer a –30 modifier. This sleight
has no effect on self or touch-range sleights.

SUBLIMINAL
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION:   Instant
    STRAIN MOD: +2           SKILL:    Control
The Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence
the train of thought of another person by implement-
ing a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind
of the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the
recipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was
their own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short
and simple; as a rule of thumb, the gamemaster may
only suggestions encompassed by a short sentence
(for example: “open the airlock,” or “hand over the
weapon”). At the gamemaster’s discretion, the target
may receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are
immediately life threatening (“jump off the bridge”)
or that violate their motivations or personal strictures.
Suggestions do not need to be carried out immediately,
they may be implanted with a short trigger condition
(“when the alarm goes off, ignore it”).

THOUGHT BROWSE
    PSI TYPE:   Active       ACTION:     Complex
    RANGE:      Touch        DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: –1          SKILL:   Sense
Thought Browse is a less-intrusive form of mind
reading which scans the target’s surface thoughts for
certain “keywords” like a particular word, phrase,
sound, or image chosen by the async. Rather than dig-
ging through the target’s ego as with the Deep Scan
sleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a
target has a particular person, place, event, or thing
in mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to
draw conclusions without the need to invade the mind

%%% txt/231.txt
 directly. Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing
 the async to continue scanning the target’s thoughts
 over time. The async must beat the target in an Op-
 posed Test for each scanned item.



 PSYCHOSURGERY
 Given the reach of neuroscience in the time of
 Eclipse Phase, it is easy to think of the mind as
 programmable software, as something that can be
 reverse-engineered, re-coded, upgraded, and patched.
 To a large degree, this is true. Aided by nanotechnol-
 ogy, genetics, and cognitive science, neuroscientists
 have demolished numerous barriers to understand-
 ing the mind’s structure and functions, and even
 made great leaps in unveiling the true nature of
 consciousness. Genetic tweaks, neuro-mods, and
 neural implants offer an assortment of options for
 improving the brain’s capabilities. The transhuman
 mind has become a playground—and a battlefield.
 Nanovirii unleashed during the Fall infected mil-
 lions, altering their brains in permanent ways, with
 occasional outbreaks still occurring a decade later.
 Cognitive virii roam the mesh, plaguing infomorphs
 and AIs, reprogramming mind states. An “infectious
 idea” is now a literal term.
    In truth, mind editing is not an easy, safe, and
 error-proof process—it is difficult, dangerous, and
 often flawed. Neuroscience may be light years
 ahead of where it was a century ago, but there are
 many aspects of the brain and neural functions
 that continue to confound and elude even the
 brightest experts and AIs. Technologies like nano-
 neural mapping, uploading, digital mind emulation,
 and artifi cial intelligence are also comparatively
 in their infancy, being mere decades old. Though
 transhumanity has a handle on how to make these
 processes work, it does not always fully understand
 the underlying mechanisms.
    Any neurotech will tell you that mucking around
 in the mind’s muddy depths is a messy business.
 Brains are organic devices, molded by millions of
 years of unplanned evolutionary development. Each
 is grown haphazardly, loaded with evolutionary

   leftovers, and randomly modified by an unlimited
   array of life events and environmental factors. Every
   mind features numerous mechanisms—cells, con-
   nections, receptors—that handle a dizzying array
   of functions: memory, perception, learning, reason-
   ing, emotion, instinct, consciousness, and more. Its
   system of organization and storage is holonomic,
   diffused, and disorganized. Even the genetically-
   modified and enhanced brains of transhumans are
   crowded, chaotic, cross-wired places, with each
   mind storing its memories, personality, and other
   defining features in unique ways.
     What this means is that though the general ar-
   chitecture and topography of neural networks can
   be scanned and deduced, the devil is in the details.
   Techniques used to modify, repair, or enhance one
   person’s mind are not guaranteed equal success
   when applied to another’s brain. For example, the
   process by which brains store knowledge, skills, and
   memories results in a strange chaining process where
   these memories are linked and associated with other
   memories, so attempts to alter one memory can
   have adverse affects on other memories. In the end,
   minds are slippery and dodgy things, and attempts
   to reshape them rarely go as planned.

   THE PROCESS OF PSYCHOSURGERY
   Psychosurgery is the process of selective, surgical altera-
   tion of a transhuman mind. It is a separate field from
   neural genetic modification (which alters genetic code),
   neuralware implantation (adding cybernetic or biotech
   inserts to the brain or nervous system), or brain hacking
   (software attacks on computer brains, neural inserts, and
   infomorphs), though they are sometimes combined.
      Psychosurgery is almost always performed on a
   digital mind-state, whether that be a real-time emula-
   tion, a backup, or a fork. In most cases, the subject’s
   mind-state is copied via the same technology and pro-
   cess as uploading or forking, and run in a simulspace.
   The subject need not be willing, and in these cases
   the subject’s permissions are restricted. Numerous
   psychosurgery simulspace environments are available,
   each custom-designed for facilitating specific psy-
   chosurgical goals and programmed with a thorough
   selection of psychotherapy treatment options.

   The actual process of psychosurgery breaks down
into several stages. First is diagnosis, which can
involve the use of several neuro-imaging techniques
on morphed characters, mapping synaptic connec-
tions, and building a neurochemical model. It can
also involve complete psychological profiling and
psychometric behavioral testing, including personal-
ity tests and simulspace scenario simulations. Digital
mind-states can be compared to records of people
with similar symptoms in order to identify related
information clusters. This analysis is used to plan
the procedure.
   The actual implementation of psychosurgical al-
teration can involve several methods, depending on
the desired results. Applying external modules to the
mind-state is often the best approach, as it doesn’t
meddle with complicated connections and new inputs
are readily interpreted and assimilated. For treat-
ments, mental health software patches compiled from
databases of healthy minds are matched, customized,
and applied. Specialized programs may be run to
stimulate certain mental processes for therapeutic
purposes. Before an alteration is even applied, it may
first be performed on a fork of the subject and run at
accelerated speeds to evaluate the outcome. Likewise,
multiple treatment choices may be applied to time-ac-
celerated forks this way, allowing the psychosurgeon
to test which is likely to work best.
   Not all psychosurgery is performed for the subject’s
benefit, of course. Psychosurgery can be used to inter-
rogate or torture prisoners, erase memories, modify
behavior, or inflict crippling impairments. It is also
sometimes used for legal punishment purposes, in
an attempt to impair criminal activity. Needless to
say, such methods are often brute-forced rather than
fine-tuned, ignoring safety parameters and sometimes
resulting in detrimental side effects.
PSYCHOSURGERY MECHANICS
In game terms, psychosurgery is handled as a Task
Action requiring an Opposed Test. The psychosurgeon
rolls Psychosurgery skill against the target’s WIL x 3.
Apply modifiers as appropriate from the Psychosur-
gery Modifiers table.
   If the psychosurgeon succeeds and the subject fails,
the psychosurgery is effective and permanent. The
alteration becomes a permanent part of the subject’s
ego, and will be copied when uploaded (and some-
times when forking).
   If both sides succeed but the psychosurgeon rolls
higher, the psychosurgery is effective but temporary. It
lasts for 1 week per 10 points of MoS.
   If the subject rolls higher, or if the psychosurgeon
fails their roll, the attempt does not work.
   The timeframe listed for psychosurgical procedures
is according to the patient’s subjective point of view.
Since most subjects are treated in a simulspace, time
acceleration may drastically reduce the amount of
real-time such a procedure requires (see Defying Na-
ture’s Laws, pp. 240–241).

MENTAL STRESS
Psychosurgery is a modification to the transhuman
mind, and sometimes to the actual person that resides
in that mind. It is unsurprising then that psychosur-
gery places stress on the subject’s mental state and
sometimes even inflicts mental traumas.
   Each psychosurgery option lists a Stress Value
(SV) that is infl icted on the subject regardless of
the tests’ success or failure. If the psychosurgeon
achieves an Excellent Success (MoS 30+), this stress
is halved (round down). If the psychosurgeon rolls
a Severe Failure (MoF 30+), the stress is doubled.
Alternately, a Severe Failure could result in unin-
tended side effects, such as affecting other behav-
iors, emotions, or memories.

%%% txt/233.txt
   If a critical success is rolled, no stress is applied at
all. If a critical failure is rolled, however, an automatic
trauma is applied in addition to the normal stress.
   Some psychosurgery conditions may also affect the
SV, as noted on the Psychosurgery Modifiers table.

ROLEPLAYING MIND EDITS
Many of the changes incurred by psychosurgery are
nebulous and difficult to pin down with game me-
chanics. Alterations to a character’s personality and
mind-state are often better handled as roleplaying fac-
tors anyway. This means that players should make a
real effort to integrate any such mental modifications
into their character’s words and actions, and game-
masters should ensure that a character’s portrayal
plays true to their mind edits. Some psychosurgical
mods can be reflected with ego traits, while others
might incur modifiers to certain tests or in certain
situations. The gamemaster should carefully weigh a
brain alteration’s effects, and apply modifiers as they
see appropriate.

PSYCHOSURGERY PROCEDURES
  The following alterations may be accomplished
with psychosurgery. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
other mind-editing procedures may be attempted,
using these as a guideline.

BEHAVIORAL CONTROL
    TIMEFRAME:   1 week
                 Limit/Boost –10; Block/Encourage –20,
    PM:
                 Expunge/Enforce –30
    SV:         (1d10 ÷ 2, round up)
Commonly used for criminal rehabilitation, behavioral
control attempts to limit, block, or expunge a specific
behavior from the subject’s psyche. For example, a
murderer may be conditioned against acts of aggres-
sion, or a kleptomaniac might be restricted from steal-
ing. Some people seek this adjustment willingly, such
as socialite glitterati who restrict their desire to eat, or
an addict who cuts out their craving for a fix.
   Behavioral control can also be applied as an un-
leashing or reinforcement. A companion may desire
to eliminate their sexual inhibitions, for example, or
a hypercorp exec may boost his commitment to place
work above all else.
  A character will simply feel compelled to avoid
a behavior that is limited (perhaps suffering a –10
modifier), but will find it quite difficult to pursue a be-
havior that is blocked (requiring a WIL x 3 Test, and
suffering a –20 modifier). They will find themselves
completely incapable of initiating a behavior that is
expunged, and if forced into the behavior will suffer
a –30 modifier and (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) points of
mental Stress.
   Likewise, a character will feel compelled to pursue a
behavior that is boosted, and will find it hard to avoid
 engaging in a behavior that is encouraged (requiring a
 WIL x 3 Test to avoid). They will have no choice but
 to engage in enforced behaviors, and will suffer (1d10
 ÷ 2, round up) points of mental Stress if prevented
 from doing so.

 BEHAVIORAL MASKING
      TIMEFRAME:   1 week
      PM:          –20
      SV:       1d10 ÷ 2, round up
    Given the ability to switch bodies, many security
 and law enforcement agencies have resorted to per-
 sonality and behavioral profiling as a means of iden-
 tifying people even when they resleeve. Though such
 systems are far from perfect, someone’s unconscious
 habits and quirks could potentially give them away.
 Characters who wish to elude identification in this
 way may undergo behavioral masking, which seeks
 to alter and change the character’s unconscious habits
 and social cues. Apply a +30 modifier when defending
 against such identification systems and Kinesics Tests.

 DEEP LEARNING
      TIMEFRAME:   Skill Learning Time +2
      PM:          +20
     SV:        1
    Using tutorial programs, memory reinforcement
 protocols, conditioning tasks, and deep brain stimula-
 tion, the subject’s learning ability is reinforced, allow-
 ing them to learn new skills more quickly.

 EMOTIONAL CONTROL
      TIMEFRAME:   1 week
                   Limit/Boost –10; Block/Encourage –20,
      PM:
                   Expunge/Enforce –30
      SV:      (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) + 2
    Similar to behavioral control, emotional control
 seeks to modify, enhance, or restrict the subject’s
 emotional responses. Some choose these modifica-
 tions willingly, such as limiting sadness in order to
 be happier, or encouraging aggression in order to be
 more competitive. Mercenaries and soldiers have been
 known to expunge fear. Follow the same rules as given
 for Behavioral Control.

%%% txt/234.txt
INTERROGATION
    TIMEFRAME:   Variable (gamemaster discretion; 1 week default)
    PM:          +30
    SV:       1d10
  Psychosurgery can be used for interrogative pur-
poses via the application of mental torture and ma-
nipulation. A successful Psychosurgery Test applies a
+30 modifier to the Intimidation Test for interrogation.

MEMORY EDITING
    TIMEFRAME:   1 week (2 weeks adding/replacing)
    PM:          –10 (willing) or –30 (forced)
    SV:       (1d10 ÷ 2, round up)
   By monitoring memory recall (forcibly invoked
if necessary), psychosurgeons can identify where
memories are stored in the brain and target them for
removal. Memory storage is complex and diffused,
however, and often linked to other memories, so re-
moving one memory may affect others (gamemaster
discretion).
  Adding or replacing memories is a much more com-
plicated operation and requires that such memories be
copied from someone who has experienced them or
manufactured with XP software. Even when success-
fully implanted, fake memories may clash with other
(real) memories unless those are also erased.

PERSONALITY EDITING
    TIMEFRAME:   1 week
    PM:          Minor –10; Moderate –20, Major –30
    SV:        (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) + 3
   Possibly the most drastic psychosurgery procedure,
personality editing involves altering the subject’s core
personality traits. The personality factors that may be
modified is almost unlimited, including traits such as
openness, conscientiousness, altruism, extroversion/
introversion, impulsiveness, curiosity, creativity, con-
fidence, sexual orientation, and self-control, among
others. These traits may be enhanced or reduced to
varying degrees. The effect is largely reflected by role-
playing, but the gamemaster may apply modifiers as
they see fit.

PSYCHOTORTURE
    TIMEFRAME:   Variable
    PM:          +30
    SV:       1d10 SV per day
  Psychotorture is mental manipulation for the simple
intention of causing pain and anguish, reflected in
game terms as mental stress and traumas. Prolonged
torture can lead to serious mental disorders or worse.
PSYCHOTHERAPY
    TIMEFRAME:   Variable
    PM:          +0
    SV:        0
  Therapeutic psychosurgery is beneficial for charac-
ters suffering from mental stress, traumas, and disor-
ders. A successful Psychosurgery Test applies a +30
modifier to mental healing tests, as noted on p. 215.

SKILL IMPRINTS
    TIMEFRAME:   1 week per +10
    PM:          +0
    SV:        1 per +10
  Skill imprinting is the use of psychosurgery to insert
skill-set neural patterns in the subject’s brain, tempo-
rarily boosting their ability. Skill imprints are artificial
boosts, however, degrading at the rate of –10 per day.
No skill may be boosted higher than 60.

SKILL SUPPRESSION
    TIMEFRAME:   1 day per –10
    PM:          –10
    SV:       1 per +10
  Skill suppression attempts to identify where skills
are stored in the brain and then block or remove
them. The subject’s skill is impaired and may be lost
entirely.

TASPING
    TIMEFRAME:   1 day
    PM:          +10
    SV:         1
   Tasping is the use of deep brain stimulation tech-
niques to tickle the mind’s pleasure centers. Though
this procedure is often used for therapeutic purposes
for patients suffering from depression or other mental
illnesses, the intent with tasping is to overload the
subject into a prolonged state of almost unendurable
bliss. Such stimulation is highly addictive, however, so
character’s exposed to it for any length of time (over
1 hour, subjective) are likely to pick up the Addiction
trait (p. 148). Some criminal organizations have been
known to use tasping addiction and rewards as a
means of controlling those under their thrall.

               Futura was a joint initiative spearheaded by    d

           proven the feasibility of Accelerated Life Ex-      ca

           used both older subjects and a lesser amount        fa

 ESH■THE MESH■THE MESH■THE MESH



MESH
   Before the Fall, humanity interfaced with each other
   through the internet, interconnected networks that
   served as the technical backbone for the evolv-
   ing world wide web. While it began as a electronic
   medium for retrieving information from various
   sources (replacing even older paper-based info-
   sources), succeeding generations emphasized digital
   communities and hosted services such as networking
   sites, wikis, blogs, and folksonomies. These facili-
   tated openness, collaboration, and sharing, thereby
   laying the groundwork for a modern, interconnected
   information society. Further stages emphasized wire-
   less interaction, geolocation, and semantic web ap-
   proaches and achieved quantum leaps in the realm
   of user interaction with the advent of brain-computer
   interfaces, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality
   (VR), and experience playback (XP).
      This environment, coupled with the exponential
   growth of processing power and memory storage, cre-
   ated an evolutionary path for the development of intel-
   ligent agents—designed to augment human informa-
   tion processing—that then transformed into artificial
   intelligences (AIs) in the following decades. While these
  “weak” AIs did not possess the full range of human
   cognitive abilities, tended towards overspecialization,
   and were restrained by programmed limitations, the
   digital evolution toward artificial general intelligences
   (AGIs)—”strong” AIs with intelligence capabilities
   that equaled or exceeded human abilities—could not
   be halted. From this point it was but a matter of time
   before so-called seed AI would come into existence,
   machine minds capable of recursive self-improvement,
   leading to an exponential growth in intelligence. Un-
   fortunately for humanity, the TITANs were the result.
      Even before the Fall, however, the internet of old
   was transforming into something new. Instead of con-
   necting via central servers, users were wirelessly link-
   ing to each other, creating a decentralized intermeshed
   network of handheld devices, personal computers,
   robots, and electronic devices. Users were online all of
   the time and connected with everything and everyone
   around them in a ubiquitous computing environment.
  This was especially true of those participating in
   humanity’s expansion into space. Disconnected from
   the internet due to distance and light-speed commu-
   nication lags, these users were nevertheless connected
   with all of the people and objects in their nearby
   environment or habitat, creating local wireless mesh
   networks. Thus was the mesh born, taking the place
   of the old internet of earth, lost during the Fall.



  MESH CAPABILITIES
  The mesh, as it exists in Eclipse Phase, is only possible
  thanks to major developments made in computer and
  communication technologies and nanofabrication.

 Wireless radio transmitters and receivers are so unob-
 trusively tiny that they can literally be factored into
 anything. As a result, everything is computerized and
 connected, or at least tagged with a radio frequency
 ID (RFID) chip. Even food is tagged with edible chips,
 complete with expiration date and nutritional content.
 Other communications mediums, such as laser and
 microwave links, add to the information flow.
    Data storage technology has advanced to such high
 levels that even an individual user’s surplus storage
 capacity can maintain an amount of information
 easily surpassing the entire 20th-century internet.
 Lifeloggers can literally record every moment of their
 life and never fear about running out of room. The
 amount of data that people carry around in the mesh
 inserts in their head or in portable ecto personal com-
 puters is staggering.
    Processing capabilities also exist at hyper-efficient
 levels. Even massive supercomputers are a thing of the
 past when modest handheld devices can fulfill almost
 all of your needs, even while simultaneously running a
 personal AI assistant, downloading media, uploading
 porn, and scanning thousands of newsfeeds. Within
 the mesh network, devices that near their processing
 limits simply share the burden with devices around
 them, creating a massively distributed framework that
 in some ways is like an entire supercomputer to itself,
 shared by everyone.
    Similarly, transmission capacity now far exceeds
 most citizens’ definition of need. Anyone born within
 the last several generations has always lived in a world
 in which hyper-realistic, multi-sensory media of nearly
 any length is available for instantaneous download
 or upload from anywhere. Massive databases and
 archives are copied back and forth with ease. Band-
 width is such a non-issue that most people forget it ever
 was. In fact, given the sheer amount of data available,
 finding the information or media you’re looking for
 takes considerably longer than downloading it. The
 mesh is also never down. As a decentralized network,
 if any one device is taken offline, connections merely
 route around it, finding a path via the thousands if not
 millions of available nodes. Similarly, the entire mesh
 behaves like a peer-to-peer network, so that large trans-
 fers are broken into manageable chunks that take inde-
 pendent routes. In fact, most users maintain personal
 torrent archives that are publicly accessible and shared.
    Private networks still exist, of course. Some are
 physically walled away behind closed-access wired net-
 works or even wireless-inhibiting infrastructure that
 keep a network isolated and contained. Most, however,
 operate on top of the public mesh, using encrypted
 tunneling protocols that provide private and secure
 communications over unsecured networks. In other
 words, these private networks are part of the mesh
 along with everything else, but only the participants

 MESHING TECHNOLOGIES
 Almost all biomorphs in the solar system are equipped
 with basic mesh inserts (p. 300)—implanted personal
 computers. These implants are grown in the brain via
 non-intrusive nanosurgery. The processor, wireless
 transceiver, storage devices, and other components
 are directly wired to the user’s cerebral neuronal cells
 and cortical centers responsible for language, speech,
 and visual perception among others. Thought-to-
 communication emulations (so called transducing)
 enables the user to control the implant just by think-
 ing and to communicate without vocalizing. Input
 from the mesh inserts is transmitted directly into the
 brain and sometimes perceived as augmented reality,

   overlaid on the user’s physical senses. In a similar
   vein, the mesh inserts installed in synthmorphs and
   pods are directly integrated with their cyberbrains
   (creating a potential security concern as cyberbrains
   are vulnerable to hacking).
      External devices called ectos (p. 325) are also
   used to access the mesh, though these are growing
   increasingly rare given the prevalence of mesh inserts.
   Ecto interface options include haptic interfaces like
   touch-display controls, bracelets or gloves that detect

   keyboards), eye tracking and blink control, body

of news, media, discourse, knowledge, environmental
data, business, and culture. Transhumans embrace
the mesh as a tool for exchange, communication,
and participation with other users, both local and far
away. As such, the mesh is an up-to-date, authoritative
source on all transhuman knowledge and activities.
   Not everything online is available for free, of course,
except perhaps in the autonomist zones. Quite a bit of
proprietary data is kept off the grid in secure storage
or sequestered away in private networks. Some of this
is for sale, and heavily encumbered with digital restric-
tions—software, media, nanofabrication blueprints,
skillsofts, etc. A thriving open source movement offers
free and open source alternatives to much proprietary
data, however, and numerous digital piracy groups
deal out cracked versions of proprietary material,
despite pressure from some authorities. Other data is
simply secured from competitive interests (hypercorp
research projects) or is an extremely private affair,
such as ego backups.

SPIMES
Along with the accumulated data of transhuman
affairs, the mesh is also cluttered with information
derived from untold numbers of wireless-capable sen-
sor-enabled devices that continuously update the mesh
with their location, sensor recordings, and other data.
Colloquially called “spimes,” these location-aware,
environment-aware, self-logging, self-documenting
objects broadcast their data to anyone who cares to
listen. Since visual, auditory, and other sensors are
absurdly tiny and inexpensive, they are ubiquitously
incorporated into nearly every object or product a
person might wear, apply, use, or internalize. This
allows almost any user to reach out through the mesh
and gather environmental data and ambient sensor
recordings from a specific location (or at least public
locales—private areas typically block such signals or
slave them to a local AI that filters their output).

SURVEILLANCE, PRIVACY, AND SOUSVEILLANCE
While spimes are easily trackable, they also con-
tribute to an environment of universal surveillance.
Between spimes, microsensors, ubiquitous security
systems, and the recording capabilities of the mesh
inserts used by almost everyone, just about every-
thing is recorded. Factor in the availability of mesh-
tracking, facial recognition, rep/social networks, and
other data mining software, and it rapidly becomes
clear that privacy is an outdated concept. Special
considerations must be embraced by anyone that
seeks to mask their identity or cover their movements.
Alternately, off-the-shelf looks common with some
morphs (especially synthmorphs and pods) allow a
user to blend in with the masses.
   Though in part this may seem an Orwellian sur-
veillance nightmare, the abundance of recording
tech actually works as “sousveillance” (watching
from below), serving a role in making everything
transparent and putting checks on abuses of power.

%%% txt/241.txt
Authoritarian regimes tread carefully, as they are also
universally monitored, despite their attempts to con-
trol information flow. Many people also willing par-
ticipate in this open “participatory panopticon.” With
nearly infinite storage capacity, dedicated lifeloggers
record every moment of their lives and share it for
others to experience.



INTERFACING: AR, VR, AND XP
Mesh media is accessed using one of three protocols:
augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), or expe-
rience playback (XP).

AUGMENTED REALITY
 Most users perceive data from the mesh as aug-
 mented reality—information overlaid on the user’s
 physical senses. For example, computer-generated
 graphics will appear as translucent images, icons,
 or text in the user’s field of vision. While visual AR
 data—called entoptic data—is the most common,
 other senses may also be used. AR is not limited
 to visuals, however, and can also include acoustic
 sounds and voices, odors, tastes, and even tactile
 sensations. This sensory data is high-resolution and
 seemingly “real,” though it is usually presented as
 something ghostly or otherwise artificial so as not
 to be confused with real-world interactions (and
 also to meet safety regulations).
   User interfaces are customized to the user’s prefer-
 ences and needs, both graphically and content-wise.
 Filters allow users to access the information they
 are interested in without needing to worry about
 extraneous data. While AR data is typically placed
 in the user’s normal field of vision, entoptics are not
 actually limited by this and may be viewed in the
“mind’s eye.” Nevertheless, icons, windows and other
 interaction prompts can be layered, stacked, toggled,
 hidden, or shifted out of the way if necessary to in-
 teract with the physical world.

AVATARS
Every mesh represents themselves online via a digi-
tal avatar. Many people use digital representations
of themselves, whereas other prefer more iconic
designs. This may be an off-the-shelf look or a
customized icon. Libraries of avatars may also be
employed, enabling a user to switch their represen-
tation according to mood. Avatars are what other
users see when they deal with you online—i.e., how
you are represented in AR. Most avatars are ani-
mated and programmed to reflect the user’s actual
mood and speech, so that the avatar seems to speak
and have emotions.

E-TAGS
Entoptic tags are a way for people to “tag” a physical
person, place, or object with a piece of virtual data.
These e-tags are stored in networks local to the tagged
item, and move with the item if it changes location.
INFORMATION AT
YOUR FINGERTIPS
The following information is always available for m
mesh users in a normal habitat:

LOCAL CONDITIONS
• Local maps showing your current location, annotated with
  local features of personal interest (according to your perso
  preferences and filters) and your distance from them/direct
  to them. Details regarding private and restricted areas (gov
  ment/hypercorp areas, maintenance/security infrastructure,
  are usually not included.
• Current habitat life support (climate) conditions including
  atmosphere composition, temperature.
• Current solar system and habitat orbit maps with trajectory
  plots, communication delays.
• Local businesses/services, directions, and details.

LOCAL MESH
• Public search engines, databases, mesh sites, blogs, forums
  archives, along with new content alerts.
• Syndicated public newsfeeds in a variety of formats, filtered
  according to your preferences.
• Sensor/spime (mostly audio-visual) feeds from any public a
  of the habitat.
• Private network resources (including tactical nets).
• Automatic searches for new online references to your nam
  and other subjects of interest.
• E-tags pertaining to local people, places, or things.
• Facial/image recognition searches of public mesh/archives
  match a photo/vid still.

PERSONAL INFORMATION
• Morph status indicators (medical and/or mechanical): blood
  pressure, heart rate, temperature, white cell count, nutrient
  levels, implant status and functionality, etc.
• Location, functionality, sensor feeds, and status reports of y
  possessions (via sensors and transmitters in these possessi
• Access to one’s life-spanning personal audio-visual/XP arch
• Access to one’s life-spanning personal file archive (music, s
  ware, media, documents, etc.).
• Credit account status and transactions.

SOCIAL NETWORKS
• Communications account status: calls, messages, files, etc.
• Reputation score and feedback.
• Social network status, friend updates.
• Updated event calendar and alerts.
• The public social network profiles of those around you.
• The location and status of those nearby and involved in the
  same AR games as you.

%%% txt/242.txt
 E-tags are viewable in AR, and can hold almost any
 type of data, though short notes and pictures are the
 most common. E-tags are often linked to particular
 social networks or circles within that network, so that
 people can leave notes, reviews, memorabilia media,
 and similar things for friends and colleagues.

 SKINNING
 Since reality can be overlaid with entoptics of hyper-
 real quality, modern users can “skin” their reality by
 modifying their perceptual input. Environments around
 them may be modified to fit their particular tastes or
 mood. Need your spirits boosted? Pull up a skin that
 makes it seems like your outdoors, with the sun shining
 down, the sounds of gentle surf in the background, and
 butterflies drifting lazily overhead. Pissed off? Be com-
 forted as flames engulf the walls and thunder grumbles
 ominously in the distance. It is not uncommon for
 people to go about their day, accompanied by their own
 personal soundtrack that only they can hear. Even ol-
 factory and taste receptors can be artificially stimulated
 to experience sensations like the smell of roses, fresh air,
 or freshly-baked pastries. While originally developed
 to make “space food” less distasteful and as a method
 to counter space-induced cabin fever for those that
 weren’t born in space, vast archives of aromas, tastes,
 and environments are available for download.
    Skins do not need to be kept private, they may
 also be shared with others via the mesh. Tired of
 your cramped habitat cubicle? Decorate it with a

AR censorware is also common in some communities
with strict religious or moral convictions.

VIRTUAL REALITY
Virtual reality overrides the user’s physical senses and
places them inside an entirely computer-generated
environment called a simulspace. While AR is used
for all common day activities and interactions, VR is
used mainly for recreation (gaming, virtual tourism,
escapism), socializing, meeting (when face-to-face
meetings are not possible), and training. Dedicated
networks with high-capacity information processing
are required to render and run large and complex
hyper-real simulspaces with many users, and these
are often hard-wired for additional stability. Smaller
simulspaces capable of hosting a smaller amount of
users can be run on a smaller distributed network of
linked devices. Many infomorphs and AIs effectively
reside within simulspaces, and some transhumans
have sworn off the physical world altogether.

      great lengths to make sure that everyone had access to the
      detection signatures and countermeasures—and we mean ev-

      and open source security software released in the past decade.
      Every habitat in the system—well, every one with a lick of
      sense anyway—employs such measures in their chokepoints
      and mesh infrastructure.

      Yes. The problem is that the Exsurgent virus and similar TITAN

      we mostly eradicated them from our networks, new versions
      periodically pop up, using some new trick to get past the
      Firewall scans and wreak havoc. Our warning and outbreak
      response system has it down to a science, and such instances
      are usually contained.

      Well, there’s always the chance that variants are still skipping
      around out there, under our radar. What’s worse to contemplate,
      though, is that we may get another major outbreak that spreads
      to multiple habitats before we can contain it. That might get
      very, very bad, very, very quickly.

DEFYING NATURE’S LAWS
A plethora of simulspace environments are available,
ranging from simulations of real places to historical
recreations to fantastic worlds representing almost
every genre imaginable. All of these simulations are
bolstered by the fact that possible scenarios are not
bound by the laws of nature. The fundamental forces
of reality and nature, like gravitation, electromag-
netism, atmosphere, temperature, etc., are program-
mable in VR, allowing for environments that are
completely unnatural, such as escheresque simulspace
where gravity is relative to position. These domain
rules may be altered and manipulated according to
the whim of the designer.
  Time itself is an adjustable constant in VR, though
deviation from true time has its limits. So far, tran-
shuman designers have achieved time dilation up to
60 times faster or slower than real time (roughly one
minute equaling either one hour or one second). Time
slowdown is far more commonly used, granting more
time for simulspace recreational activities (more time,
more fun!), learning, or work (economically effective).
Time acceleration, on the other hand, is extremely
useful for making long distance travel through space
more tolerable.

ACCESSING SIMULSPACES
Most simulspaces can be accessed through the mesh
just like any other node. Since VR takes over the
user’s sensorium, however, and sometimes involves
time perception dilation, users are cut off from other
mesh-delivered sensory input and interacting directly
with other nodes. Instead, outside mesh interactions
are routed through the simulspace’s interface (mean-
ing that a character may browse the mesh, communi-
cate with others, etc. from inside a simulspace, if the
domain rules allow it).
   Since physical senses are overridden when a user
accesses VR, most people prefer to rest their body
in a safe and comfortable environment while in the
simulspace. Body-fitting cushions and couches help
users relax and keep them from cramping up or in-
juring themselves if they happen to thrash around.
In case of long-term virtual sojourns (for instance,
during space travel), morphs are normally retained
in tanks that sustain them in terms of nutrition and
oxygen. Many VR entertainment and game networks
offer dedicated and hardwired physical VR cafes
with private pods. Visitors rent a pod and physically
jack in, using either access jacks or an ultrasonic
trode net that reads and transmits brain patterns
when placed on the head.
  When accessing a simulspace, the user first enters
an electronic buffer “holding space” known as a
white room. Here the user chooses a customizable
avatar-like persona to represent them in the simul-
space, called a simulmorph. From this point, the user
immerses themself in the virtual reality environment,
effectively becoming their simulmorph.
EXPERIENCE PLAYBACK
Every morph with mesh inserts has the capability
to transmit or record their experiences, a form of
technology called experience playback, or XP. Since
the first programs were developed that provide a
simple interface to “snapshot” ones experiences, it
has become extremely popular to share XP with
friends and social networks, or with the online public
at large.
   The level of experiences depends on how much of
the recorded sensory perception is kept when the clip
is made. Full XP includes exteroceptive, interoceptive,
and emotive tracks. Exteroceptive tracks include the
traditional senses of sight, smell, hearing, touch, and
taste that process the outside world. Interoceptive
tracks include senses originating within the body, such
as balance, a sense of motion, pain, hunger and thirst,
and a general sense of the location of one’s own body
parts. Emotive tracks include the whole spectrum of
emotions which can be aroused in a transhumans.
Due to the biological requirements (neuronal and
endocrine systems) of expressing emotions, hardcore
XP aficionados deem only the experience in and from
biomorphs as the real deal.



MESH USES
There are many reasons people use the mesh. The
foremost is communication: voice and video calls
(typically displaying avatars rather than actual
video), electronic messaging (e-mail, instant mes-
saging, microblogging), and file and data transfers.
Socializing is also key, handled via social and reputa-
tion networks, personal profiles, lifelogging, chats
and conferences (both AR and VR), and discussion
groups and forums. Information gathering is also
at the top, whether its browsing the popular Solar-
chive or other databases and directories, tapping
the latest newsfeeds, browsing mesh sites, tracking
your friends, taking lessons in VR, or looking up just
about anything conceivable. Recreation rounds out
the pack, covering everything from gaming (AR and
VR) to experiencing other people’s lives (XP) to VR
tourism and club-hopping.

PERSONAL AREA NETWORKS
Since everything a person carries is meshed, most
people maintain personal area networks that route
all of these devices through their mesh inserts or ecto,
which acts as a hub. This is both a security measure,
ensuring they maintain control over their own acces-
sories, and a convenience factor, as it focuses all of the
controls in one place.

VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS
Virtual private networks (VPNs) are communica-
tions networks tunneled through the mesh, which
are dedicated for a specific group of people. The
primary use of VPNs is to create privacy and secu-
rity for its users, and so they typically use security

%%% txt/244.txt
features such as ego authentication and public key
encryption. VPNs are regularly used to mesh mobile
offices into a corporate network or mesh people to-
gether who work on or contribute a certain project.
Other VPNs—particularly social networks and rep
networks—operate with minimal security features,
simply serving as a network of specific users within
the mesh and making it easier to keep in touch,
transfer information, make updates, and so on. Most
VPNs come as specialized software suites that run
custom environmental software that integrates into
the user’s normal mesh interface and AR.

SOCIAL NETWORKS
Social networks are the fabric of the mesh, weaving
people together. They are the means by which most
people keep in contact with their friends, colleagues,
and allies, as well as current events, the latest trends,
new memes, and other developments in shared
interests. They are an exceptionally useful tool for
online research, getting favors, and meeting new
people. In some cases, they are useful for reaching
or mobilizing masses of people (as often illustrated
by anarchists and pranksters). There are thousands
of social networks, each serving different cultural
and professional interests and niches. Most social
networks allow users to feature a public profile to
the entire mesh and a private profile that only those
close to them can access.
  Reputation plays a vital part in social networks,
serving as a measure of each person’s social capital.
Each person’s reputation score is available for lookup,
along with any commentary posted by people who
favored or disfavored them and rebuttals by the user.
Many people automate their reputation interactions,
instructing their muse to automatically ping some-
one with a good review after a positive action and
to likewise provide negative feedback to people with
whom the interaction went poorly.

MOBILE OFFICES
Due to the lack of office space and the wireless ac-
cessibility of most information, most businesses
now operate virtually, with few or no fixed offices
or even assets. Instead, individuals have become their
own mobile office. Bit-pushers and bureaucrats like
hypercorp executives, clerical workers, accountants,
and researchers—as well as innovators like artists,
writers, engineers, and designers—work wherever
they want to.
  The most prominent example of this phenomenon
are the bankers of the Solaris hypercorp. Each em-
ployee acts as a mobile one-person banking office,
managing transactions via Solaris’s robust VPN.
   On rare occasions, office environments are run
in simulspace with time dilation to maximize effi-
ciency. Since this requires the workers to access a
centralized wired network and leave their bodies
unattended while accessing simulspace, however, it
requires an extra level of physical security that is
typical only of some governmental installations and
corporate habitats.



ISLANDS IN THE NET
In the time of Eclipse Phase, information can become
outdated quite fast, and the accessibility of new infor-
mation depends on your location. It’s easy to keep up-
to-date on your local habitat/city or planetary body,
but keeping current on events elsewhere is typically
reliant on the speed of light.
   If you happen to be in a station in the Kuiper Belt,
on the edge of the solar system 50 astronomical units
from the terrestrial inner planets, waiting on a mes-
sage from Mars, the signal carrying the message will
be roughly seven hours old when it reaches you. Of
course it will only reach you that fast if you are using
quantum farcast, which is only limited by the speed
of light (not to mention rare and expensive in most
habitats). If you are not using a quantum farcaster,
the signal may take even longer and is prone to in-
terference and noise, deteriorating the quality and
possibly losing some of the content, especially over
major distances. Whenever you start dealing with
communication between habitats, you have to factor
in the light-speed lag, the amount of time it takes
even the fastest transmission to reach you. This lag
works both ways, so trying to hold a conversation
with someone just 5 light-seconds away means that
you’re waiting at least 10 seconds to get the reply
to whatever you just said. For this reason, AR and
VR communications are almost always conducted lo-
cally, while standard messaging is used for nonlocal
communications. For detailed discussions, it is often
simpler to send a fork of yourself (p. 273) to have the
conversation and then return.
  Quantum-entanglement communicators (p. 314)
are one solution to this light-speed lag, although a
burdensome and expensive one. QE comms allow
for faster-than-light communication to an entangled
communicator, though each transmission uses up a
precious amount of quantum-entangled bits, which
are in limited supply.
  Transmissions made between habitats almost
always occur via each station’s massive data relays,
where they are then distributed into the local mesh.
This bottleneck is often used by authoritarian habitats
to monitor data transmissions and even filter or censor
certain public non-encrypted content. Some messages
are also prioritized over others, potentially meaning
further delays.

%%% txt/245.txt
   The method of transmission between habitats also
sometimes matters. Radio and neutrino broadcasts
can be intercepted by anyone, whereas tight-beam
laser or microwave links are specifically used as a
point-to-point method that minimizes interception
and eavesdropping. The use of quantum farcasting
using neutrino systems is completely secure, however,
and is the most frequently-used intra-habitat link.
   What these lags, bottlenecks, and prioritizations
mean is that some news and data takes a particularly
long-time to trickle from one local mesh network to
another, passing slowly from habitat to habitat. This
means that there are always gradients of information
available to different local mesh networks, typically
depending on proximity and the importance of the
information. Some data even gets lost along the way,
never making it further than a habitat or two before
it is lost in the noise. The only way to retrieve such
information is to track it down to its source.

DARKCASTS
“Darkcasts” are ranged communications that go out-
 side of legal and approved channels. Since certain hab-
 itats have strict regulations on transmission content,
 forking, egocasting, infomorphs, muse abilities, and
AGI code, underworld groups like the ID crew profit
 by offering illegal data transmission services. Primarily
 used for censored data and banned content (like illegal
XPs or malware), local organized crime factions also
 often offer egocasting services complete with resleev-
 ing and leasable morphs, allowing egos that prefer
 discretion to enter or leave a habitat without drawing
 attention. Though such authorities hunt down these
 darkcast networks whenever they get a chance, many
 habitats have a sophisticated darkcast infrastructure
 that makes use of decoys, temporary communications
 lines, relays, and regular transmitter relocation—not
 to mention judicious bribing and blackmailing.
MESH ABUSES
As with all things, the mesh has its darker side. At
the basic level, this amounts to flamewar-starting
trolls, stalkers, or griefers whose intent is to mess
with others for a laugh. At the more organized level,
it expands to illicit or criminal enterprises that utilize
the mesh, such as selling black/snuff/porn XPs, ille-
gal software, pirated media, or even egos. The most
infamous threats—thanks both to the Fall and to
the continuous sensationalism applied by media and
stern authorities—are, of course, malware and hack-
ers. Given the capabilities of modern hackers and the
vulnerability of many habitats—where damage to life
support systems could kill thousands—the threat may
not be over-exaggerated.

HACKERS
Whether individuals who are genuinely interested
in exploring new technologies and seeking ways to
break them in order to make them better, hacktiv-
ists who utilize the mesh in order to undermine the
power of authorities, or “black hats” who seek to
circumvent network security for malicious or crimi-
nal intent, hackers are a permanent fixture of the
mesh. Unauthorized network break-ins, infiltration
of VPNs, muse subversion, cyberbrain hijacking, data
theft, cyber-extortion, identity fraud, denial of service
attacks, electronic warfare, spime hijacking, entoptic
vandalism—these are all common occurrences on the
mesh. Thanks to smart and adaptive exploit programs
and assisting muses, even a moderately skilled hacker
can be a threat.
   In order to counter hacking attempts, most people,
devices, and networks are protected by a mix of
access control routines, automated software intru-
sion prevention systems, encryption, and layered
firewalls, typically overseen by the user’s muse who
plays the role of active defender. Extremely sensitive

%%% txt/246.txt
systems—such as space traffic control, life support,
power systems, and hypercorporate research facili-
ties—are usually limited to isolated, tightly-controlled,
heavily-monitored, hard-wired networks to minimize
the risk of intrusion from snoopers and saboteurs.
various countermeasures may be applied against
such intruders, ranging from locking them out of the
system to tracking them back and counterhacking.

MALWARE
The number of worms, virii, and other malware pro-
grams that ripped through computer systems during
the Fall was staggering. Many of these were part of
the netwar systems prepared by old Earth nation-states
and corporations and unleashed on their enemies.
Others were products of the TITANs, subversive pro-
grams that even the best defenses had trouble stopping.
Even 10 years later, many of these are still reappearing,
brought back to life by the accessing of some long-
forgotten data cache or the accidental infection of a
scavenger mucking through old ruins. New ones pop
every day, of course, many of them programmed by
criminal hacker outfits, while others that enter circu-
lation are modifications and variations of suspected
TITAN designs, perhaps implying that certain parties
are intentionally tinkering with this code and releasing
it into the wild. Rumors and whispers circulate that
some of these TITAN worms are even more potent and
frightening than previously hinted at, with stunning
adaptive capabilities and intelligence. These rumors
are steadfastly denied by authority figures and security
experts ... who then quietly turn around and do their
best to ensure that their own networks remain safe.



AI S AND INFOLIFE
Self-aware helper programs were originally designed
and realized to augment transhuman cognitive abili-
ties. These specialized-focus AIs were then developed
into the more complete, independent digital conscious-
nesses known as AGIs. The further evolution of these
digital life forms into seed AIs unfortunately led to the
emergence of the TITANs and then the Fall. This cre-
ated a rift in transhuman society as fear and prejudice
turned popular opinion against unrestricted AGIs, an
attitude of mistrust that still lingers to this day.

AI S
The term AI is used to refer to narrow, limited-focus
AIs. These digital minds are expert programs with pro-
cessing capabilities equal to or even exceeding that of
a transhuman mind. Though they have a personality
matrix with individual identities and character, and
though they are (usually) conscious and self-aware,
their overall complexity and capabilities are limited.
The programmed skills and abilities of AIs are typi-
cally very specific in scope and aligned towards a par-
ticular function, such as piloting a vehicle, facilitating
mesh searches, or coordinating the functions of some
habitat sub-system. Some AIs, in fact, can only barely
be considered sapient, and their emotional program-
ming is usually narrow or non-existent.
  AIs have a number of built-in safety features and
programmed limitations. They must serve and obey the
instructions of authorized users within their normal
functioning parameters and (in the inner system at
least) must also obey the law. They lack self-interest
and self-initiative, though they have limited empathy
and may be programmed to anticipate the needs and
desires of users and pre-emptively take action on
their behalf. Perhaps most importantly, however, is
that their psychological programming is specifically
based on universal human modes of thought and an
understanding and support of transhuman goals
and interests. This is part of an initiative to engineer
so-called “friendly AIs,” who are programmed with
sympathy towards transhumanity and all life and seek
out their best interests.
   In most societies, basic AIs are considered “things”
or property rather than people and are accorded no
special rights.

MUSES
Muses are a specific type of AI designed to function
as a personal aide and companion. Most people in
Eclipse Phase have grown up with a muse at their
virtual side. Muses tend to have a bit more personality
and psychological programming than standard AIs and
over time they build up an extensive database of their
user’s preferences, likes and dislikes, and personality
quirks so that they may more effectively be of service
and anticipate needs. Muses generally have names
and reside within the character’s mesh inserts or ecto,
where they can manage the character’s personal area
network, communications, data queries, and so on.

AGIS
AGIs are complete and fully operational digital con-
sciousnesses, self-aware and capable of intelligent
action at the same level as any transhuman. Most have
full autonomy and the capacity for self-improvement
by a processing similar to learning—a slow optimi-
zation and expansion of their code that features
programmed limitations to prevent it from achiev-
ing the self-upgrading capabilities of seed AIs. They
have more fully-rounded personalities and emotional/
empathic abilities than standard AIs, due in part to
a development process where they are literally raised
within a VR simulation analogous to the rearing of
transhuman children, and so are more fully socialized.
As a result, they have a fairly human outlook, though
some deviation is to be expected, and sometimes is
apparent in great degrees. Despite this attempt to hu-
manize AGIs, they do not have the same evolutionary
and biological origins that transhumans have, and so
their social responses, behavior, and goals are some-
times off-mark or decidedly different.
  AGIs bear the social stigma of their non-biological
origin and are often met with bias and mistrust. Some
habitats have even outlawed AGIs or subject them to

  strict restrictions, forcing such infolife to hide their
  true natures or illegally darkcast to enter habitats or
  stations. AGI mind programming emulates transhu-
  man brain patterns sufficiently well that they can be
  sleeved into biomorphs if they choose.

  SEED AI
  Due to the capability for unlimited self-upgrading,
  seed AIs have the capacity to grow into god-like
  digital entities far beyond the level of transhumans
  or AGIs. They require massive processing power and
  are always increasing in complexity due to a continual
  metamorphosis of their code. Seed AIs are too com-
  plex to be downloaded into a physical morph, even
  a synthetic one. Even their forks require impressive
  processing environments, so doing so is rare. In fact,
  most seed AIs require the capacities of hard-wired
  networks to survive.
    The only seed AIs known to the public are the
  infamous TITANs who are widely regarded as being
  responsible for the Fall. In truth, the TITANs were
  not the first seed AIs and will probably not be the last.
  There are no publicly known TITANs (or other seed
  AIs) currently residing in the solar system, despite
  circulating rumors of damaged TITANs who were left
  behind on Earth, speculated TITAN activity under the
  clouds of Venus, or whispers of new seed AIs hidden
  away in secret networks on the edges of the system.

  TRANSHUMAN INFOMORPHS
  For thousands of infugees, embodying a digital form
  is their only choice. Some of these are locked away
  in mesh-separated virtual holding areas or even inac-
  tive storage, locked up by habitats who didn’t have
   NON-STANDARD AIS
   AND AGIS
   Not all AIs and AGIs were programmed and de
   signed to adhere to human modes of thought
   and interests. Such creations are illegal in some
   jurisdictions, as they are considered a potential
   threat. Several hypercorps and other groups have
   initiated research into this field, however, with
   varying results. In some cases these digital minds
   are so different from human mindsets that com
   munication is is impossible. In others, enough
   crossover exists to allow limited communication
   but such entities are invariably quite strange.
      Rumors persist that some AIs began their
   life as transhuman backups or forks, who were
   then heavily edited and pruned down to AI
   level intelligences.                            ■



enough resources to handle them. Others are impris-
oned inside simulspaces, killing time in whatever way
they choose until an opportunity to resleeve comes
their way. Quite a few are free to roam the mesh, in-
teracting with physically-sleeved transhumans, keep-
ing up with current events, and sometimes even form-
ing activist political blocs to campaign for infomorph
rights or interests. Still others find or are forced into
virtual careers, slaving away in the digital sweatshops
of hypercorps or criminal syndicates. A few find com-
panions who are willing to bring them along in their
ghostrider module and become an integral part of
their lives, much like a muse.
   Some transhumans willingly choose the infomorph
lifestyle, either for hedonism (custom simulspace and
VR games until the end of time), escapism (loss of a
loved ones leads them to write off physical concerns
for awhile), freedom (go anywhere the mesh takes
you—some have even beamed copies of themselves to
far distant solar systems, hoping someone or something
will receive their signal when they arrive), experimen-
tation (forking and merging, running simulations, and
weirder things), or because it is ensured immortality.



EVERYDAY MESH MECHANICS
Everyone (and everything) is meshed in Eclipse Phase.
The following rules and concerns apply to standard
mesh use. Note that various mesh-related terms are
explained, along with other Eclipse Phase concepts,
under Terminology, p. 25.

MESH INTERFACE
Characters have a choice of which interface to use, the
entoptic interface of basic mesh inserts or the haptic
interface of an ecto.
  The basic mesh inserts used by most users allows
them to interact with AR, VR, XP, and the mesh at the

%%% txt/248.txt
speed of thought. This is the default method of mesh
use and suffers no modifiers. They are, however, more
prone to visual and operative impairments (virtual il-
lusions, denial-of-service effects) when hacked.
  Characters who use the haptic interface of an ecto,
however, suffer a slight delay on their mesh activities
due to manual toggling, physical controls, and physi-
cal interaction with virtual controls. In game terms,
the use of haptics imposes a –10 skill modifier to
all mesh tests where timing is rushed (particularly
combat and or any sort of mesh use under pressure).
Additionally, increase the timeframe for mesh-based
Task Actions by +25% when interfacing via haptics.
On the positive side, ectos can be easily removed and
discarded if compromised—for this reason, many
hackers and security-conscious users use an ecto in
addition to their mesh inserts, routing all high-risk
traffic through the ecto as an extra line of defense.

MESH ID
Every mesh user (and, in fact, every device) has a
unique code called their mesh ID. This ID distin-
guishes them from all other users and devices, and is
the mechanism by which others can find them online,
like a combination phone number, email address, and
screen name. Mesh IDs are used in almost all online in-
teractions, which are often logged, meaning that your
activities online leave a datatrail that can be tracked
(p. 251). Fortunately for Firewall sentinels and others
who value their privacy, their are ways around this
(see Privacy and Anonymity, p. 252). AIs, AGIs, and
infomorphs also each have their own unique mesh ID.

ACCOUNTS AND ACCESS PRIVILEGES
Devices, networks (such as PANs, VPNs, and hard-
wired networks), and services require that every user
that accesses them does so with an account. The
account serves to identify that particular user, is
linked to their mesh ID, and determines what access
privileges they have on that system. There are four
types of accounts: public, user, security, and admin.

PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
Public accounts are used for systems that allow
access (or access to parts of their system) to anyone




  ELITE EXPLOITS
  The mesh gear quality rules allow for players
  and gamemasters to make a distinction between
  software tools, separating the open-source,
  stock-repertoire exploit tools of amateur hackers
  from cutting-edge military-grade penetration
  wares. While many characters will simply buy or
  otherwise acquire such programs, a hacker with
  the do-it-yourself ethic is likely going to want
  to design their own personalized applications,
  based on their playbook of closely-guarded in-
  trusion/counterintrusion methods.
     To reﬂect the efforts a hacker character makes
  by designing, coding, and modifying their own
  customized personal arsenals, they may make a
  Task Action Programming Test with timeframe
  of 2 weeks. If they succeed, they upgrade one
  of their software tools by one level of quality
  (i.e., from +0 to +10). Multiple Programming
  Tests can be made to enhance a program, but for
  each level add the target modifier as a negative
  modifier to the test (so upgrading a +0 suite to
  +10 is a –10 modifier on the Programming Test).
     Similarly, at the gamemaster’s discretion, soft-
  ware tools—particularly exploits—may degrade
  in quality over time, reﬂecting that they have
  become outdated. As a general rule, such pro-
  grams should degrade in quality about once
  every 3 months.                                 ■

%%% txt/249.txt
on the mesh. Public accounts do not require any sort
of authentication or login process, the user’s mesh ID
is enough. These accounts are used to provide access
to any sort of data that is considered public: mesh
sites, forums, public archives, open databases, social
network profiles, etc. Public accounts usually have
the ability to read and download data, and some-
times to write data (forum comments, for example),
but little else.

USER ACCOUNTS
User accounts are the most common accounts. User
accounts require some form of authentication (p. 253)
to access the device, network, or service. Each user ac-
count has specific access privileges allotted to it, which
are tasks the user is allowed to perform on that system.
For example, most users are allowed to upload and
download data, change basic content, and use the
standard features of the system in question. They are
not, however, usually allowed to alter security features,
add new accounts, or do anything that might impact
the security or functioning of the system. As some sys-
tems are more restrictive than others, the gamemaster
decides what privileges each user account provides.

SECURITY ACCOUNTS
Security accounts are intended for users that need
greater rights and privileges than standard users, but
who don’t need control over the entire system, such
as security hackers and muses. Security access rights
usually allow for reading logs, commanding security
features, adding/deleting accounts, altering the data of
other users, and so on.

ADMIN ACCOUNTS
Admin accounts provide complete control over the
system. Characters with admin rights can do every-
thing security accounts can, plus they can shut down/
reboot the system, alter access rights of other users,
view and edit all log files and statistics, and stop or
start any software available on the system.

MESH GEAR QUALITY
Not all gear is created equal, and this is especially true
of computers and software, where new innovations
are made on a daily basis. Keeping up-to-date with
the last specs isn’t too difficult, but on occasion the

   characters will get their hands on some old relic or
   find themselves in secluded or decrepit places with
   local systems and gear that aren’t up to date. Likewise,
   they may acquire some cutting-edge gear straight
   from the labs or may run up against a state-of-the-art
   installation with next-generation defenses. To reflect
   this, mesh tests can be modified according to the state
   of the hardware or software being used, as noted on
   the Mesh Gear Modifiers table
  .
   COMPUTER CAPABILITIES
   Computerized electronics can be broken down into
   three simple categories: peripherals, personal comput-
   ers, and servers. In game terms, all are collectively
   referred to as devices.

   PERIPHERALS
   Peripherals are micro-computerized devices that don’t
   need the full processing power and storage capacity of
   a personal computer, but benefit from online network-
   ing and other computerized functions. Peripherals may
   run software, but the gamemaster may decide that too
   many programs (10+) will degrade the system’s perfor-
   mance. AIs and infomorphs are incapable of running
   on peripherals, though they may access them. Peripher-
   als only have public and user accounts (users accounts
   include security and admin functions; see p. 247).
     Common peripherals include: spimes, appliances, most
   cybernetic implants, individual sensors, and weapons.

   PERSONAL COMPUTERS
   Personal computers account for a wide range of com-
   puter types, but essentially account for anything that
   has the capabilities evolved from generations and gen-
   erations of personal computers to meet an everyday
   user’s needs. Most personal computers are portable
   and tailored for use by multiple users at a time. Per-
   sonal computers may run one AI or infomorph at a
   time. They may not run simulspace programs.
     Common personal computers include: mesh inserts,
   ectos, and vehicles.

   SERVERS
   Servers have much greater processing power and
   data management capabilities than personal comput-
   ers. They are capable of handling hundreds of users,
   multiple AIs and infomorphs, and they may run


MODIFIERS

%%% txt/250.txt
simulspace programs. Though few are portable, some
of them come close.

SOFTWARE
A wide manner of software is available for mesh users,
from firewalls and AIs to hacking and encryption tools
to tacnets and skillsofts. These programs are listed on
p. 331 of the Gear chapter. Like other gear, software
may enable a character to perform a task they could
not otherwise. The quality of the software may also be
a factor, applying a modifier as appropriate (see Mesh
Gear Quality, p. 247).
   Some software is equipped with digital restrictions
to prevent it from being copied and shared with others.
These restrictions may be defeated, but it is a time-con-
suming task, requiring a Task Action Programming Test
with a timeframe of 2 months. Thanks to the efforts
of the open source movement and numerous individual
software pirates, however, quite a bit of software is
available free or online. The availability of pirated soft-
ware or freeware will depend on the local habitat and
legalities. Finding it may be a matter of a simple search,
or it may require some use of reputation to find some-
one who has it. Usually there is at least one local crime
syndicate that is willing to help you out—for a price.

SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY
In most instances, software compatibility is not going
to be an issue for characters. Gamemasters who like
it as a plot device, however, can introduce compat-
ibility problems in certain cases, whether this is done
to increase drama, slow the characters down, or create
obstacles that they must overcome. Such incompat-
ibilities are more likely to arise when dealing with
outdated systems or devices, or at least ones that are
unlikely to have the latest patches and software up-
dates. Incompatibilities can also be used as a drawback
to acquiring software from untrustworthy sources.
   Conflicting software issues are going to have one of
two effects. Either the software will simply not work
with certain devices, or it will inflict a –10 to –30
modifier due to instabilities and glitches. If the game-
master allows it, a character may reduce this penalty
by patching up the software, requiring a successful
Programming Task Action (1 day). For every 10 points
of MoS, reduce the incompatibility modifier by 10.

TRAFFIC FILTERS AND MIST
Mesh networks and AR are overrun with yottabytes of
information. Though mesh inserts and ectos can deal
with a lot of data traffic in terms of bandwidth and
processing power, using filters to weed out unwanted
traffic is quite simply a necessity. This is especially true
of AR, where unwanted entoptics can clutter your
vision and distract you. Nevertheless, entoptic spam of
many flavors—advertisements, political screeds, porn,
scams—do their best to bypass these filters, and in
many areas the amount of unfiltered entoptics can be
overwhelming—a phenomenon colloquially referred
to as “mist.”
  At the gamemaster’s discretion, mist can interfere
with a user’s sensory perceptions. This modifier can
range from –10 to –30, and in some cases might be
so distracting as to affect all of a character’s actions.
To lift the data fog, a character or muse must adjust
their filter settings by succeeding in an Interfacing Test
modified by the mist modifier. Alternately, the charac-
ter can completely disable AR input, but this is likely
to impede them in other ways.

SLAVING DEVICES
   For ease of use, as well as for privacy and security
purposes, one or more devices may be slaved to each
other. One device (usually the character’s mesh inserts
or ecto) takes the role of master, while the other
device(s) takes the role of slave. All traffic to and
from slaved devices is routed through the master. This
allows a slaved device to rely on the master’s security
features and active monitoring. Anyone that wants to
connect to or hacked into a slaved device is rerouted
to the master for authentication and security scrutiny.
Slaved devices automatically accept commands from
their master device. This means that a hacker who
penetrates a master system can legitimately access
and issue commands to a slaved device, assuming their
access privileges allow for it.
   PANs are typically formed by slaving all of a char-
acter’s devices to their ecto or mesh inserts. Similarly,
individual components of a security system (doors,
sensors, etc.) are usually slaved to a central security
node that serves as a chokepoint for anyone hoping
to hack the system. The same is often true for other
networks and facilities.

ISSUING COMMANDS
Characters may issue commands to any slaved device
or teleoperated bot (see Shell Remote Control, p. 196)
with a Quick Action. Each command counts separately,
unless the character is issuing the same command to
multiple devices/drones.

DISTANCE LAG
Anytime you extend your communications over great
distances, you run into the risk of time lags. Most
communications are restricted to “local” for this
reason, which generally means your local habitat
and any others within 50,000 kilometers. On plan-
etary bodies like Mars, Venus, Luna, or Titan, “local”
encompasses all of the habitats and linked mesh net-
works on that planetary body.
  If a character is searching the mesh beyond their
local area, the most efficient way is to transmit a search
AI (usually a copy of your muse) or a fork to the non-
local area, which will then run its search and return
completed results. This process does, however, add to
the time of transmission to the timeframe (i.e., search-
ing the mesh of a station 10 light-minutes away adds
20 minutes to the search as the search is transmitted
over and the results are transmitted back). Since long-
distance communications are sometimes interfered with

or bumped for higher-priority items, the gamemaster
can increase this time at their discretion. If the research
involves correlation and fine-tuning the search param-
eters based on data accumulated from different locals,
the timeframe may be exponentially increased due to
the need for back-and-forth interaction.
   If the character is simply communicating with or
accessing non-local networks, an appropriate time lag
must be introduced between communications and ac-
tions. The effects of this lag are largely up to the game-
master, as fitting current distances and other factors.

ACCESSING MULTIPLE DEVICES
Meshed characters may connect to and interact with
numerous devices, networks, and services simulta-
neously. There is no penalty for doing this, but the
character may only focus on one system at a time. In
other words, you may only interact with one system
at a time, though you may also switch between them
freely, even within the same Action Phase. You could,
for example, spend several Quick Actions to send a
message with your ecto, tell your spime oven at home
to start cooking dinner, and look up a friend’s updated
profile on a social network. You may not, however,
hack into two separate systems simultaneously.
   Note that you may send the same command to
multiple slaved devices or teleoperated drones with
the same Quick Action, as noted above.



ONLINE RESEARCH
The Research skill (p. 184) represents a character’s
ability to track down information in the mesh. Such
information includes any type of digitized data: text,
pictures, vids, XP, sensor feeds, raw data, software, etc.
This data is culled from all manner of sources: blogs,
archives, databases, directories, social networks, rep
networks, online services, forums, chat rooms, torrent
caches, and regular mesh sites of all kinds. Research
is conducted using various public and private search
engines, both general and specialized, as well as data
indices and search AIs.
   Research has other uses as well. Hackers use it
when looking for specific information on a network or
device on which they have intruded. Likewise, since
everyone inevitably uses and interacts with the mesh,
Research skill is also a way to identify, backtrack, and/
or gather information on people as long as they have
not hidden their identity, worked anonymously, or
covered their identity with a shroud of disinformation.

SEARCH CHALLENGES
Due to the sheer amount of data available, find-
ing what you’re looking for may sometimes seem a
daunting task. Thankfully, information is fairly well
organized, thanks to the hard work of “spider” AIs
that cruise the mesh and constantly update data and
search indices. Additionally, information on the mesh
is tagged with semantics, meaning that it’s presented
with code that allows a machine to understand the
context of that information as well as a human reader
would. This helps AIs and search software correlate
data more efficiently. So finding the data is usually not
as difficult as analyzing it and understanding it. Find-
ing specialized or hidden info or correlating data from
multiple sources is usually the real challenge.
  Perhaps a larger issue is the amount of incorrect data
and misinformation online. Some data is simply wrong
(mistakes happen) or outdated, but the nature of the
mesh means that such things can linger on for years
and even propagate far and wide as they are circulated
without fact-checking. Likewise, given the amount of



  SEARCH CAPABILITIES
  Online research in Eclipse Phase is not the same
  as just googling something. Here are five ways in
  which it is vastly improved:
     Pattern Recognition: Biometrics and other forms
  of pattern recognition are efficient and intelligent.
  It is not only possible to run image recognition
  searches (in real-time, via all available spimes
  and sensor feeds), but to search for patterns such
  as gait, sounds, colors, emotive displays, traffic,
  crowd movement, etc. Kinesics and behavioral
  analysis even allow sensor searches for people
  exhibiting certain behavioral patterns, such as sus-
  picious loitering, nervousness, or agitation.
     Metadata: Information and files online come
  with hidden data about their creation, alteration,
  and access. A photo’s metadata, for example,
  will note what gear it was taken on, who took
  it, when, and where, as well as who accessed it
  online, though such metadata may be easily
  scrubbed or anonymized.
     Data Mash-Ups: The combination of abundant
  computing, archived data, and ubiquitous public
  sensors enable intriguing correlations to be
  drawn from data that is mined and collated. In
  the midst of a habitat emergency such as a ter-
  rorist bombing, for example, the ID of everyone
  in the vicinity could be scanned, compared to
  data archives to separate out those who have a
  history of being in the vicinity at that particular
  time, with those remaining checked against
  databases of criminal/suspect history and their
  recorded actions analyzed for unusual behavior.
     Translation: Real-time translation of audio and
  video is available from open source translation bots.
     Forecasting: A significant percentage of what
  people do on any day or in response to certain situ-
  ations conforms to routines, enabling easy behav-
  ioral prediction. Muses take advantage of this to
  anticipate needs and provide whatever is desired
  at the right moment and in the right context. The
  same logic applies to actions by groups of people,
  such as economics and social discourse, making pre-
  dictions markets a big deal in the inner system. ■

%%% txt/252.txt
transparency in modern society, some entities actively
engage in disinformation spreading in order to clut-
ter the mesh with enough falsehoods that the truth is
hidden. Two factors help to combat this, the first being
that data sources themselves have their own reputation
scores, so that untrustworthy or disreputable sources
can be identified and ranked lower in search results.
Second, many archives take advantage of crowdsourc-
ing—that is, harnessing the collaborative power of
mesh users (and their muses) everywhere—to verify
data integrity so that these sites are dynamic and
self-correcting.

HANDLING SEARCHES
Online research is often a crucial element of Eclipse
Phase scenarios, as characters take to the mesh to
research backgrounds and uncover clues. The follow-
ing suggestions present a method of handling research
that does not rely solely on dice rolls and integrates it
with the flow of the plot.
   First, common and inconsequential information
should be immediately available without requiring
a roll at all. Most characters rely on their muses to
handle searches for them, passing on the results while
the character focuses on other things.
   For searches that are more detailed, difficult, or
central to the plot, a Research Test should be called
for (made either by the character or their muse).
This test indicates the process of finding links to
and/or accumulating all data that may in fact be
relevant to the search topic. This test should be
modified as appropriate to the obscurity of the topic,
ranging from +30 for common and public topics
to –30 for obscure or unusual intel. This initial
search has a timeframe of 1 minute. If successful, it
turns up enough data to give the character a basic
overview, perhaps with cursory details. The game-
master should use the MoS to determine the depth
of the data provided on this initial excursion, with
an Excellent Success providing some bonus details.
Similarly, a Severe Failure (MoF 30+) may result in
the character working with data that is incorrect or
intentionally misleading.
   The next step is not so much accumulating links
and data as it is analyzing and understanding the in-
formation acquired. This requires another Research
Test, again modified by the obscurity of the topic. If
the gamemaster allows it, complementary skills (p.
173) may apply to this test, providing bonus modi-
fiers (for example, an understanding of Academics:
Chemistry would help research the effects of a
strange drug). Muses may also perform this task,
though their skills are typically inferior. As above,
success determines the quality and depth of the
analysis, with an Excellent Success providing the full
story and potential related issues and a Severe Fail-
ure marking completely incorrect assumptions. The
timeframe for this phase of research largely depends
on two factors: the amount of data being analyzed
and the importance to the storyline. Gamemasters

%%% txt/253.txt
need to carefully measure out their distribution of
intel and clues to players. Give them too much too
soon, and they may spoil the plot. Fail to give them
enough, and they may get frustrated or pursue dead
ends. Timing is everything.

REAL-TIME SEARCHES
Characters may also set up ongoing mesh scans that will
alert them if any relevant information comes up new or
updated, or is somehow changed. This is a task usually
assigned to muses for continuous oversight. Whenever
such data arises, the gamemaster secretly makes a Re-
search Test, modified by the obscurity of the topic. If
successful, the update is noted. If not, it is missed, though
the gamemaster may allow another test if and when the
topic reaches a wider range of circulation or interest.

HIDDEN DATA
It is important to remember that not everything can
be found online. Some data may only be acquired (or
may be more easily gotten) by asking the right people
(see Networking, p. 286). Information that is consid-
ered private, secret, or proprietary will likely be stored
away behind VPN firewalls, in off-mesh hardwired
networks, or in private and commercial archives. This
would require the character to gain access to such
networks in order to get the data they need (assuming
they even know where to look).
   It’s worth noting that some entities send out AIs
into the mesh with the intent of finding and erasing
data they’d rather hide, even if this requires hacking
into systems to alter such information.



SCANNING, TRACKING,
AND MONITORING
Most users leave traces of their physical and digital
presence all throughout the mesh. Accounts they access,
devices with which they interact, services they use, ent-
optics they perceive—all of these keep logs of the event,
and some of these records are public. Simply passing
nearby some devices is enough to leave a trail, as near-
field radio interactions are often logged. This electronic
datatrail can be used to track a user, both to ascertain
their physical location or to note their online activities.

WIRELESS SCANNING
To interface with a wireless device or network, whether
to establish a connection or for other purposes, the
target device/network must be located first. To locate
an active node, it’s wireless radio transmissions must be
detected. Most wireless devices automatically scan for
other devices in range (see Radio and Sensor Ranges, p.
299) as a matter of course, so no test is required. This
means that it’s trivial for any character to pull up a
list of the wireless devices and networks around them,
along with associated mesh IDs. Likewise, a muse or
device can be instructed to alert the user when a new
signal (or a specific user) comes into range.
   Detecting stealth signals (p. 252), however, is a bit
more challenging. To detect a stealthed signal, the scan-
ning party must actively search for such signals, taking
a Complex Action and making an Interfacing Test with
a –30 modifier. If successful, they detect the hidden emis-
sions. If the character aiming for stealth engages in active
countermeasures, also requiring a Complex Action, then
an Opposed Interfacing Test is called for (with the –30
modifier still applying to the scanning party).
   For covert devices that are only transmitting in
short bursts, wireless detection is only possible during
the short period the burst transmission is being made.

PHYSICAL TRACKING
Many users willingly allow themselves to be physically
tracked via the mesh. To them, this is a useful feature—
it allows their friends to find them, their loved ones to
know where they are, and for authorities to come to
their aid in the event of some emergency. Finding their
location is simply a matter of looking them up in the
local directory, no test required (assuming you know
who they are). Mesh positioning is accurate to within
5 meters. Once located, the position of the target can
be monitored as they move as long as they maintain
an active wireless connection to the mesh.

TRACKING BY MESH ID
An unknown user’s physical location can also be
tracked via their online mesh activity—or more spe-
cifically, by their mesh ID (p. 246). Network security
will often trace intruders this way and then dispatch
security squads to bring them in. To track an unknown
user by their mesh ID alone requires a Research Test.
If successful, they have been tracked to their current
physical location (if still online) or last point of in-
teraction with the mesh. If the character is in privacy
mode (p. 252), a –30 modifier applies.

TRACKING BY BIOMETRICS
Given the existence of so many spimes and public
cameras and sensors, people may also be tracked by
their facial profile alone using facial recognition soft-
ware. This software scans accessible video feeds and
attempts to match it to a photo of the target. Given
the sheer volume of cameras, however, and the typical
range of false-positives and false-negatives, finding
the target often boils down to luck. Priority can be
given to cameras monitoring major thoroughfares, to
narrow the search, but this risks missing the target if
they avoid heavy traffic areas. The success of searches
of this nature is best left to gamemaster fiat, but a
Research Test can also be called for, modified ap-
propriately by the range of the area being watched,
whenever there is a chance the target may be spotted.
  Other biometric signatures may also be used for
tracking this way, though these are usually less avail-
able than cameras: thermal signatures (requires infra-
red cameras), walking gait, scent (requires olfactory
sensors), DNA (requires DNA scanners), etc. Each
biometric scan requires a separate type of software.

%%% txt/254.txt
DIGITAL ACTIVITY TRACKING
Tracking someone’s online activities (meshbrowsing,
entoptic interactions, use of services, messaging, etc.)
is slightly more difficult, depending on what exactly
you’re after. Gathering information on a user’s public
mesh activities—social network profiles, public
forums posts, public lifelogging, etc.—is handled just
like standard online research (p. 249).

TRACKING BY MESH ID
A more investigate search can attempt to use the
target’s mesh ID (p. 246), using it as a sort of digital
fingerprint to look up where else they’ve been online.
This primarily involves checking access/transaction
logs, which are not always publicly accessible. This
sort of search requires a Research Test, handled as a
Task Action with a timeframe of 1 hour.

SNIFFING
Wireless radio traffic is broadcast through the air (or
space), meaning that it can be intercepted by other wire-
less devices. “Sniffing” involves the capture and analysis
of data traffic flowing through the wireless mesh.
   To eavesdrop on wireless communications, you need
a sniffer program (p. 331) and you must be within
radio range (p. 299) of the target (alternately, you can
access a device that is within radio range of the target,
and sniff from that location). To capture the informa-
tion you must succeed in an Infosec Test. If successful,
you capture data traffic from any targeted devices in
range. Note that sniffing does not work on encrypted
traffic (including VPNs and anything else using public
key cryptography) as the results are gibberish. Quan-
tum encrypted communications cannot be sniffed.
   Once you have the data, finding the information
you’re looking for can be a challenge. Handle this as
a standard Research Test (p. 245).

REMOTE SNIFFING VIA MESH ID
Finally, a mesh ID may also be actively monitored
to see what mesh activity it engages in. This requires
special sniffer software (p. 331) and a Research Test.
If successful, the monitoring will provide information
on that user’s public mesh activities (how much is
determined by the gamemaster and the MoS), such
as which sites they access, who they message, etc. It
will not, however, uncover anything that is encrypted
(unless the encryption is broken) or anything that
takes place on a VPN (unless the VPN is hacked first),
though it will show that encrypted communications
and/or VPN use are taking place.



PRIVACY AND ANONYMIZATION
Given how easily mesh activities are monitored, many
users pursue privacy and anonymization options.

PRIVACY MODE
Characters who go into privacy mode hide their online
presence and activities from others to a limited degree.
The exact settings are adjustable, but typically involve
masking their social profiles and presence to other
users in the immediate vicinity, like having an unlisted
phone number. Privacy mode can also be used to limit
the use of mesh IDs and other data in access and
transaction logs, applying a –30 modifier to attempts
to research or track them by their online activity.

STEALTHED SIGNALS
Another tactic that can be taken for privacy is to
stealth the wireless radio signals you emit. This
method uses a combination of spread-spectrum signals,
frequency hopping, and modulation to make your
radio transmissions harder to detect with scanning (p.
251). Stealthing your signals is either a passive activity
(Automatic Action, –30 modifier on Interface Tests to
locate the signal) or an active one (Complex Action,
requires an Opposed Test to locate).

ANONYMIZATION
Anonymization takes the issue of privacy a bit further.
The user does not just hide their mesh ID, but they
actively use false mesh IDs and take other measures to
reroute and obfuscate their datatrail. Anonymization
is a necessity both for clandestine operatives and those
engaging in illicit mesh activities.

FALSE MESH IDS
The easiest method of making mesh activities anony-
mous is to set your muse to supply false mesh IDs in
online transactions. Though illegal in many jurisdic-
tions, this is an easy task for any character or muse to
do. Multiple false IDs are used, making it extremely dif-
ficult for anyone to tie all of the user’s activities together.
   This method makes it extremely difficult for anyone
to track the user’s online actions. Someone attempting
to track the character via these false mesh IDs must
beat them in an Opposed Test, pitting their Research
skill with a –30 modifier against the character’s (or
more likely, their muse’s) Infosec skill. This is a Task
Action with a base timeframe of 1 hour, adjusted
higher according to the amount of activity they hope
to track. If successful, the tracker manages to dig
together enough correlating evidence and records of
false IDs to get a picture of the character’s activities
(how thorough this picture is depends on their MoS).
If the fail, the anonymous character has effectively
camouflaged themselves in the mesh.
   Actively monitoring a character who is fluctuating
their mesh ID with a sniffer program, or physically
tracking them via the mesh, is next to impossible, as
the continual shifting of IDs and intentional decoys
make it too difficult to keep up.

ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT SERVICES
A number of people—not just criminals, hackers, and
secret agents—have an interest in keeping some of
their affairs anonymous. To meet this demand, various
online service vendors offer anonymous accounts for
messaging and credit transfers. Some of these vendors

%%% txt/255.txt
are legit business (in places where it is legal), some
are criminals operating illegally, others are hacktivists
promoting the privacy meme, and still others are hy-
percorps or other organizations offering such services
internally to their own staff/membership.
   The interaction between the vendor and user is
encrypted and anonymous, with no logs kept, so even
if the vendor’s servers are hacked, an intruder will
not find any leads. While some anonymous accounts
are established for regular use, the truly paranoid use
(multiple) one-time accounts for maximum security.
One-time accounts are used for a single message (in-
coming or outgoing) or credit transaction, and then
are securely erased.
   Tracking an anonymous account is a practical
impossibility, and something that only an extremely
resourceful organization employing a systematic and
expensive effort could attempt.

DISPOSABLE ECTOS
Another option for those seeking privacy and se-
curity is to simply use disposable ectos. Using this
method, all activity is routed through a specific ecto
(using its mesh ID), the ecto is used for a limited
period (until it gets hot), and then it is simply dis-
carded or destroyed.



MESH SECURITY
Given the lessons of the Fall and the very real risk still
posed by hackers, virii, and similar threats, network
security is taken extremely seriously in Eclipse Phase.
Four methods are typically used: authentication, fire-
walls, active monitoring, and encryption.

AUTHENTICATION
Most devices, networks (PANs, VPNs, etc.), and ser-
vices require some kind of authentication (a process
by which a system determines whether the claimed
identity of a user is genuine) before they grant an ac-
count and access privileges (p. 246) to a user. There
are several different ways for a system to authenticate
a user. Some are more reliable and secure than others,
but for the most part, the more secure the method, the
higher the operational expenses.
   Account: If you have access to an account on one
system, this may give you automatic access to related
systems or subsystems. This is typical of slaved devices
(p. 248), where access to the master automatically
grants you access to slaves.
   Mesh ID: Some systems accept mesh IDs as authen-
tication. This is extremely common with most public
systems, which merely log the mesh ID of any user
that wishes access. Other systems will only allow
access to specific mesh IDs, but these are vulnerable
to spoofing (p. 255).
   Passcode: This is a simple string of alphanumeric
characters or logographic symbols, submitted in an
encrypted format. Anyone with the passcode can
access the account.
   Biometric Scan: This calls for a scan of one or more
of the user’s biometric signatures (fingerprint, palm
print, retinal scan, DNA sample, etc.). Popular before
the Fall, such systems have fallen out of use as they
are impractical with synthmorphs or users that fre-
quently resleeve.
   Passkey: Passkey systems call for some of encrypted
code that is either hardwired into a physical device
(that is either implanted or physically jacked into
an ecto) or extracted from specialized software. Ad-
vanced passkeys combine hardwired encryption with
physical nanotech etching to create a unique key. To
access such systems, the passkey must either be ac-
quired or somehow spoofed.
   Ego Scan: This system authenticates the user’s ego
ID (p. 279).
   Quantum Key: Quantum key systems rely on the un-
breakable encryption of quantum cryptography (p. 254).

FIREWALLS
Firewalls are software programs (sometimes hard-
wired into a device) that intercept and inspect all traf-
fic to and from a protected network or device. Traffic
that meets specified criteria that designates it as safe
is passed through, whereas all other traffic is blocked.
In Eclipse Phase, every network and device can be
assumed to have a firewall by default. Firewalls are
the main obstacle that an intruder must overcome, as
discussed under Intrusion Tests, p. 255.
   Like other gear, firewalls come in varying quality
levels and so may apply modifiers to certain tests.

ACTIVE MONITORING
Instead of relying on authentication and firewalls
alone, secure systems are actively monitored by a se-
curity hacker or a muse. These digital security guards
inspect network traffic using a number of software
tools and applications that flag conspicuous events.
Active surveillance makes intrusions more difficult,
since the interloper must beat the monitoring hacker/
AI in an Opposed Test (see Intrusion, p. 254). Active
monitoring also includes monitoring any devices
slaved to the monitored system.
   Characters may actively monitor their own PANs if
they so choose, though this requires a moderate level
of attention (count as a Quick Action). It is far more
common for a muse to actively guard a user’s PAN.

ENCRYPTION
Encryption is an exceptionally effective extra layer of
security. There are two types of encryption commonly
used in Eclipse Phase: public key cryptosystems and
quantum cryptography.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTO
In public key cryptosystems, two keys are generated
by the user, a public key and a secret key. The public
key is used to encrypt messages to that user, and is
made freely available. When messages are encrypted
using that public key, only the secret key—controlled

%%% txt/256.txt
by the user—can decrypt them. Public key crypto is
widely used both for encrypting data traffic between
two users/networks/devices and for encrypting
files. Due to the strength of the public key system
algorithms, such crypto is essentially unbreakable
without a quantum computer (see Quantum Code-
breaking, p. 254).

QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
Quantum key distribution systems use quantum me-
chanics to enable secure communications between two
parties by generating a quantum key. The major advan-
tage of transmitting information in quantum states is
that the system itself instantly detects eavesdropping
attempts as quantum systems are disturbed by any sort
of external interference. In practical terms, this means
that quantum encrypted data transfers are unbreakable
and attempts to intercept automatically fail. Note that
quantum crypto doesn’t work for basic file encryption,
its only use is in protecting communication channels.
   While quantum key systems have an advantage over
public key systems, they are both more expensive and
less practical. In order to generate a quantum key,
the two communications devices must be entangled
together on a quantum level, in the same location,
and then separated. So quantum key encrypted
communications channels require some setup effort,
especially if long distances are involved. Since the
implementation of quantum cryptographic protocols
is an extraordinary expense, it is usually only adopted
for major high-security communications links.

BREAKING ENCRYPTION
What this means is that encrypted communications
lines and files are very safe if using public key systems,
and that data transfers are absolutely safe if using
quantum crypto. Gamemasters should take note, how-
ever: while this may be useful to player characters, it
may also hinder them. If the characters need to get at
something that is encrypted, they’re going to need to
figure out some way to get the secret key’s passcode.
Common methods include the old standbys of bribery,
blackmail, threats, and torture. Other options involve
espionage or social engineering to somehow acquire
the passcode. Hackers could also find some other
method to compromise the system and gain inside
access, bypassing the encryption entirely.

QUANTUM CODEBREAKING
As noted above, quantum computers can also be used
to break public key encryption. This requires an Infosec
Task Action Test with a +30 modifier and a timeframe
of 1 week (once started, the quantum computer finishes
the job on its own; the user does not need to provide
constant oversight). Gamemasters should feel free to
modify this timeframe as fits the needs of their game.
Note that quantum computers cannot break quantum-
encrypted communications, only encrypted files.



INTRUSION
The art of intrusion lies in penetrating a device’s secu-
rity. The best methods involve infiltrating a system qui-
etly, without catching a watchdog’s attention, by using
exploits—code glitches, flawed security protocols—to
create a path circumventing the target’s defenses. When
called for, however, a hacker can toss aside pretenses
and attempt to brute-force their way in.

PRECONDITIONS
In order to hack a device, the hacker needs to establish
a direct connection to the target computer system. If
the hacker is making a direct wireless connection to
the target, the target system must be wireless-capable
and within range (p. 299), and the hacker must know
the target is there (see Wireless Scanning, p. 251). If
the system is hard-wired, the hacker must physically
jack in by using a regular jacking port or somehow
tapping into a cable that carries the network’s data
traffic. If the hacker is accessing the target through the

%%% txt/257.txt
mesh, the target system must be online and the hacker
must know it’s mesh ID (p. 246) or otherwise be able
to track it down (p. 251).

CIRCUMVENTING AUTHENTICATION
Rather than hacking in, an intruder can try to sub-
vert the authentication system used to vet legitimate
users. The easiest manner of doing this is to somehow
acquire the passcode, passkey, or whatever authentica-
tion method the target uses (p. 253). With this in hand,
no test is necessary to access the system; the hacker
simply logs in just like a legitimate user and has all of
the normal access privileges of that user.
   Lacking a passcode, the hacker can try to subvert
the authentication system in one of two other ways:
spoofing or forgery.

SPOOFING AUTHENTICATION
Using this method, the hacker attempts to disguise
their signals as coming from the legitimate, authen-
ticated user, rather than from themself. If successful,
the system is fooled by this masquerade, accepting the
hacker’s commands and activity as if they came from
a legitimate user. Spoofing is more difficult to pull off,
but is very effective when it works.
   To spoof a legitimate user, the hacker must be using
both sniffer and spoofing software (p. 331). The
hacker must then monitor a connection between the
legitimate user and the target system, and succeed
in an Infosec Test to sniff the traffic between them
(p. 252). Apply a –20 modifier if the user has secu-
rity account privileges, –30 if they have admin rights
(p. 247). If the connection is encrypted, this will fail
unless the hacker has the encryption key.
   Armed with this data, the hacker then uses it to
disguise their signals. This requires an Infosec Test,
modified by the quality of the system’s firewall and
the hacker’s spoofing program. If successful, com-
munications sent by the hacker are treated as coming
from the legitimate user.

FORGING AUTHENTICATION
Biometric and passkey systems used for authentication
(p. 253) can potentially be forged hackers who are
able to get a look at the originals. The means and tech-
niques for doing so differ, and are beyond the scope of
this book, but successfully forging such systems would
allow a hacker to log in as the legitimate user.




 THE HACKING SEQUENC
 1. Defeat the Firewall
 2. Bypass Active Security
    a. Hacker Wins with Excellent Success, Defender
    b. Hacker Succeeds, Defender Fails
    c. Both Succeed
    d. Defender Succeeds, Hacker Fails
     INTRUSION TESTS
     Hacking into a node is a time-consuming task. The
     target system must be carefully analyzed and probed
     for weaknesses, without alerting its defenses. Depend-
     ing on the type of security in place, more than one test
     may be called for.
       Hackers require special exploit software (p. 331) to
     take advantage of security holes, but software does
     not a hacker make. What really counts is Infosec skill
     (p. 180), which is the ability to use, modify, and im-
     provise exploits to their full advantage.

     DEFEATING THE FIREWALL
     Lacking a passcode, the hacker must break in the old-
     fashioned way: discreetly scanning the target, look for
     weaknesses, and take advantage of them. In this case
     the hacker takes their exploit software and makes an
     Infosec Test. This is handled as a Task Action with a
     timeframe of 10 minutes. Various modifiers may apply,
     such as the quality of the exploit software, the quality
     of the Firewall, or the alertness of the target system. The
     gamemaster may also modify the timeframe, shortening
     it to reflect systems that are cookie-cutter common with
     known security flaws or raising it as fitting for a top-of-
     the-line system with still-unreleased defenses.
        By default, a hacker trying to break in this way is
     pursuing standard user access rights (p. 247). If the
     hacker wishes to obtain security or admin privileges on
     the system, apply a –20 or –30 modifier, respectively.
         If the Infosec Test succeeds, the intruder has invaded
     the system without triggering any alarms. If the system is
     actively monitored (p. 253), they must now avoid detec-
     tion by that watchdog (see below). If there is no active
     monitor, the intruder gains the status of Covert (see In-
     truder Status, p. 256). If the intruder scored an Excellent
     Success, however, their status is Hidden (p. 256).
         Probing: Players may choose to take the time (p.
     116) when probing the target for weakness and ex-
     ploits. In fact, this is a common procedure when a
     hacker wants to ensure success.

     BYPASSING ACTIVE SECURITY
     If a system is also actively monitored (p. 253), the
     hacker must avoid detection. Treat this as a Variable
     Opposed Infosec Test between the intruder and the
     monitor. The outcome depends on both rolls:
        If only the intruder succeeds, the hacker has ac-
     cessed the node without the monitor or the system

noticing. The hacker has acquired Covert status (p.
256). If the hacker scored an Excellent Success, their
status is Hidden (p. 256).
   If only the monitor succeeds, the hacking attempt
is spotted and the monitor may immediately lock the
hacker out of the system before they manage to fully
break in. The intruder may try again, but the monitor
will be vigilant for further intrusions.
   If both succeed, the intruder has gained access but
the monitor is aware that something strange is going
on. The hacker acquires Spotted status.
   If both fail, continue to make the same test on each
of the hacker’s Action Phases, until one or both succeed.

INTRUDER STATUS
Intruder status is a simple way of measuring an
invader’s situation when they are intruding upon
a system. This status has an impact on whether the
hacker has caught any attention or if they managed
to remain unobtrusive. Status is first determined when
the intruder access the system, though it may change
according to events.
  Note that intruder status is a separate matter from
account access privileges (p. 246). The latter represents
what a user can legally do on a system. The former
indicates how aware the system is of the hacker’s true
nature as an intruder.

HIDDEN
An intruder with Hidden status has managed to silent-
ly sneak into the system without anyone noticing. The
system’s security is totally unaware of their presence
and may not act against them. In this case, the hacker
is not using an account so much as they are exploit-
ing a flaw in the system that grants them a nebulous,
behind-the-scenes sort of presence in the system. The
hacker effectively has admin access rights, but does
not show up as an admin-level user in logs or other
statistics. Hidden characters receive a +30 modifier on
any efforts to subvert the system.

COVERT
An intruder with Covert status has accessed the
system in a manner that doesn’t attract any unusual
attention. For all intents and purposes, they appear
to be a legitimate user with whatever access rights
they sought. Only extensive checking will turn up any
abnormalities. The system is aware of them, but does
not consider them a threat.

SPOTTED
Spotted status indicates that the system is aware of an
anomaly or intrusion but hasn’t zeroed in on the in-
truder yet. The hacker appears to be a legitimate user
with whatever access rights they sought, but this will
not hold up under close scrutiny. The system goes on
passive alert (inflicting a –10 modifier to the hacker’s
activities on that system) and may engage the hacker
with passive countermeasures (p. 257).
LOCKED
Locked status means that the intruder—including their
datatrail—has been pinned down by system security.
The hacker has access and account privileges, but they
have been flagged as an interloper. The system is on
active alert (inflicting a –20 modifier on the hacker’s ac-
tions) and may launch active countermeasures (p. 257)
against the intruder.

CHANGING STATUS
An intruder’s status is subject to change according to
their actions and the actions of the system.

UPGRADING STATUS
A hacker can attempt to improve their status in order
to better protect themself. This requires a Complex
Action and an Infosec Test. If the hacker has Spotted
status, this is an Opposed Test between monitor and
intruder. If the hacker wins and scores an Excellent
Success (MoS of 30+), they have upgraded their status
by one level (for example, from Covert to Hidden).
Intruders with Locked status may not upgrade.

ZEROING IN
A security hacker or muse that is actively monitoring
a system can take a Complex Action and attempt to
hone in on a Spotted intruder. An Opposed Infosec Test
is made between both parties. If the system’s defender
wins, the hacker is downgraded to Locked status.

FAILING TESTS
Any time an intruder scores a Severe Failure (MoF
30+) on a test involving manipulating the system, they
are automatically downgraded one status level (from
Covert to Spotted, for example). If a critical failure
is rolled, they immediately give themselves away and
achieve Locked status.

BRUTE-FORCE HACKING
Sometimes a character simply doesn’t have time to do
the job right, and they need to hack in now or never.
In this case the hacker engages the target system im-
mediately, head on, without taking any time to pre-
pare an attack. The hacker simply brings all of their
software exploit tools to bear, throwing them at the
target and hoping that one works. This is handled as
an Infosec Test, but as a Task Action with a timeframe
of 1 minute (20 Action Turns). The hacker receives
a +30 modifier on this test. Many hackers choose to
rush the job (see Task Actions, p. 120), in order to cut
this time even shorter.
  The drawback to brute-force hacking is that it imme-
diately triggers an alarm. If the system is actively moni-
tored, the hacker must beat the monitor in an Opposed
Infosec Test or be immediately locked out as soon as
they break in. Even if they succeed, the hacker has
Locked status and is subject to active countermeasures.

%%% txt/259.txt
INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES
If an intruding hacker fails to penetrate a system’s
defenses (i.e., they are Spotted or Locked, see p. 256),
then the system goes on alert and activates certain
defenses. The nature of the applied countermeasures
depends on the capabilities of the system, the abilities
of its security defender(s), and the policy of its owner/
admins. While some nodes will simply seek to kick
the intruder out and keep them shut out, others will
actively counterattack, seeking to track the intruder
and potentially hack the intruder’s own PAN.

SECURITY ALERTS
Security alerts come in two flavors: passive and active.

PASSIVE ALERT
Passive alerts are triggered when an intruder hits Spot-
ted status. The system immediately flags a visual or
acoustic cue to anyone actively monitoring the system
and possibly the owner or admins. It immediately
launches one or more passive countermeasures (see
below). Depending on the system, extra security hack-
ers or AIs may be brought in to help investigate. If the
intruder is not encountered again or located within a
set time period (usually about 10 minutes), the alarm
is deactivated and the event is logged as an anomaly.
Depending on the security level of the system, some-
one may analyze the logs at some point and try to
ascertain what happened—and prevent it from hap-
pening again.
   All intruders suffer a –10 modifier for tests involv-
ing a system that is on passive alert.

ACTIVE ALERT
An active alert is triggered when an intruder hits
Locked status. The system immediately alerts the
owners, admins, and monitoring security agents.
Additional security assets (hackers and AIs) may be
called in. The system also launches active countermea-
sure against the intruder (see below). Active alerts are
maintained for as long as the intruder is present, and
sometimes for a lengthy period afterwards just in case
the hacker returns.

PASSIVE COUNTERMEASURES
Passive countermeasures are launched as a precaution
whenever an intruder acquires Spotted status.

LOCATE INTRUDER
A security hacker or AI monitoring a system may at-
tempt to track down the source of the passive alert.
See Zeroing In, p. 256.

RE-AUTHENTICATE
When a passive alert is triggered, a firewall can be set
to re-authenticate all active users, starting with the
most recent. At the beginning of the next Action Turn,
everyone on the system must take an action to log
back in. For intruders, this means making an Infosec
Test, modified by –10 for the passive alert, to satisfy
the system that they are a legitimate user.

REDUCE PRIVILEGES
As a protective measure, some systems will immedi-
ately reduce access privileges available to standard
users, and sometimes security users as well. One
common tactic is to protect all logs, backing them up
and making sure no one has rights to delete them.

ACTIVE COUNTERMEASURES
Active countermeasures can only be launched if the
intruder has acquired Locked status.

COUNTERINTRUSION
A security hacker or guardian AI can proactively
defend a system by attacking the intruder’s source. For
this to occur, the intruder must first be successfully
traced (p. 251). Once this occurs, the security forces
can then launch their own intrusion on the hacker’s
home ecto/mesh inserts and/or PAN.

LOCKOUT
A system that has locked onto an intruder may also
attempt to lock them out. Lockout is an attempt to
remove the compromised account, sever the connec-
tion between the two, and dump the hacker from
the system.
   Lockout must be initiated by someone with secu-
rity or admin privileges. An Opposed Infosec Test is
made, with the intruder suffering a –20 modifier for
being Locked. If the character defending the system
succeeds, the intruder is immediately ejected from
the system and the account they used will be placed
on quarantine or deleted. That account will not be
usable again until a security audit approves it and
replaces the authentication. Any attempt to access
the system from the same mesh ID as the intruder
automatically fails.

REBOOT/SHUTDOWN
Perhaps the most drastic option for dealing with an
interloper is to simply shut down the system. In this
case, the system closes all wireless connections (if it
has any), logs off any users, terminates all processes,
and shut itself down—thereby locking out the intruder.
The disadvantage, of course, is that the system must
interrupt its activities. For example, shutting down
your mesh inserts or ecto means losing all communica-
tion with teammates, access to augmented reality, and
control over slaved/linked devices.
   Initiating a reboot/shutdown is only a Complex
Action, but the actual process of shutdown takes
anywhere from 1 Action Turn (personal devices) to 1
minute (large hardwired networks with multiple users),
determined by the gamemaster. Rebooting a system
takes the same amount of time to get started again.

%%% txt/260.txt
TRACE
For high-security systems, a popular countermeasure
is to track the infiltrator’s physical location via their
mesh ID (see Physical Tracking, p. 251). In most cases,
habitat physical security is subsequently alerted and
forwarded the position to take care of the criminal.

WIRELESS TERMINATION
An alternative to shutdown or rebooting is simply to
sever all wireless connections by shutting down the
wireless capabilities of the system. The system will
lose all active connections, but any intruders will be
dumped. Wireless termination is a Complex Action to
initiate and completes at the end of that Action Turn.
Re-starting wireless connectivity takes 1 Action Turn.




  JOINT HACKING/
  SECURING
  Hacking will sometimes involve teams of attack-
  ers and/or teams of defenders. A hacker might
  be backed up by their muse or another team
  member with moderate Infosec skills. Hard
  networks are often defended and monitored
  by teams of highly-skilled security hackers and
  AIs. When intruding in or defending a computer
  system, operators must decide whether to act
  individually or in concert.
     Each approach has its tradeoffs. A team that
  chooses to breach or maintain a system’s security
  as a team effort must allocate one character (usu-
  ally the team member with the highest Infosec
  skill) as the primary actor (see Teamwork, p. 117).
  Each additional character and muse adds a +10
  modifier for each test (up to the maximum +60
  modifier) but cannot spend time on other actions
  than those performed by the team leader. When
  acting in concert, teams may switch team leaders
  at any time, in case group members are special-
  ized for certain tasks.
     Alternately, both intruding and defending
  teams may choose to act individually but for a
  joint goal. Each hacker must make intrusions
  on their own, with individual repercussions for
  detection and counterintrusion, which runs the
  risk of affecting all intruders if any one is Spotted
  or Locked. On the other hand, a team of intrud-
  ers can pursue multiple actions simultaneously in
  a coordinated manner and may temporarily over-
  whelm available security. The same holds true for
  system defenders, who may accomplish more by
  splitting their actions, leaving some to monitor
  while others launch counterintrusion attacks and
  other countermeasures.                              ■

%%% txt/261.txt
SUBVERSION
Once an intruder has successfully invaded a device
or network, they can pursue whatever tasks they are
interested in, as fitting that particular system. Depend-
ing on the type of account the intruder hacked, they
may or may not have access privileges to do what
they want to do. If their access rights allow it, the
activity is handled like that of a legitimate user and
no test is called for (unless the activity itself calls for
some kind of test, such as Research). For example, a
hacker who infiltrates a habitat’s security system with
a security account can monitor cameras, deactivate
sensors, review recorded surveillance footage, and so
on, as any legitimate user with security right would be
allowed to do.
   Engaging in any sort of activity for which you
don’t have access rights is more difficult and requires
hacking the system. This typically requires an Infosec
Success Test, modified by the difficulty of the action
as noted on the Subversion Difficulties table. In most
cases this in not an Opposed Test even if the system is
actively monitored, unless specifically stated otherwise.
Failing such tests, however, will result in a change of
the hacker’s intruder status (see Failing Tests, p. 256).
   Examples for different types of system subversion
are given in the Subversion Examples sidebar. This
is not an exhaustive list, however, and gamemasters
and players are encouraged to improvise game effects
in case an action has not been explicitly described.

AUGMENTED REALITY ILLUSIONS
A hacker who has infiltrated an ecto, mesh inserts, or
some other device with an AR interface may inject
different kinds of visual, auditory, tactile, and even
emotional illusions into the augmented reality of
the device’s user, depending on the type of interface
used. How the hacked user will respond to the illu-
sion depends on a number of factors, such as whether
they are aware of the intruder (i.e., the hacker has
Spotted or Locked status), what type of interface they
are using (entoptic or haptic), and how realistic the
illusion is.
   The best illusions are, of course, crafted in advance,
using the best image and sensory manipulation tools
available. Such illusions are hyper-realistic. Anyone
making a Perception Test to identify them as fake

suffers a –10 to –30 modifier (gamemaster’s discre-
tion). An eclectic collection of software programs
offer a diverse range of AR illusions.
   Hackers may also improvise illusions on the
fly, usually by patching in sensor data from others
sources, though this is more difficult and more easily
spotted (typically adding a +10 to +30 modifier to
Perception Tests). The advantage is that the hacker
can modify the illusion in reaction to the user’s ac-
tions or environmental factors on the fly. AR illusion
software, however, also offers some template illusions
that can be modified and controlled in real-time via a
connected interface.
   Whenever a user is bombarded with AR illusions, the
gamemaster should make a secret Perception Test to see
if they spot the deception. Even if they do, however, the
character may still react to them. Almost anyone will
duck when they see an object suddenly flying at their
face, as their body reacts on its own before the brain
comprehends that it’s an illusion and not a threat.
   Aside from their deceptive value, illusions can be
used to distract users or otherwise impair their percep-
tive faculties. For example, dark illusory clouds can
obscure vision, ear-wrenching high-volume noises can
make people cringe, and a persistent tickling sensation
might drive anyone crazy. Such effects can apply a –10
to –30 modifier to Perception Tests and other actions,
but the user can also adjust their filters and/or turn
their AR off if necessary.

BACKDOORS
A backdoor is a method of bypassing a system’s normal
authentication and security features. It enables a hacker
to sneak into a system by exploiting a flaw (which can
take the form of an installed program or modification
to an existing program or hardware device) that was
integrated into the system previously, either by themself
or another hacker (who shared the backdoor).
   To install a backdoor, the hacker must successfully
infiltrate the system and succeed in both a Program-
ming and an Infosec Test (or an Opposed Infosec Test
if the system is actively monitored). The Programming
Test determines how well the backdoor is crafted and
hidden within system processes, while the Infosec Test
represents incorporating it into the system without se-
curity noticing. Modify the Programming Test by –20
if the hacker wants to have security privileges when
using the backdoor, –30 for admin.
   Once installed, using a backdoor requires no test to
access the system—the hacker simply logs on as if they
were a legitimate user, gaining Covert status. Anyone
who is aware of a backdoor’s details may use it.
   How long the backdoor lasts depends on many fac-
tors and is largely up to the gamemaster. Backdoors
are only likely to be spotted during complete security
audits, so more paranoid systems are likely to detect
them earlier. Security audits may also occur when an
intruder is Spotted but never Locked. Security audits
are a Task Action with a timeframe of 24 hours. The
character conducting the audit makes an Infosec
Test to spot the back door. If the backdoor’s installer
scored an Excellent Success on their Programming
Test, this Infosec Test suffers a –30 modifier.

CRASHING SOFTWARE
Intruders can attempt to crash software programs
by killing the processes that run them. This requires a
Complex Action and an Infosec Test. Note that some
software is set to immediately respawn, but this can take
from 1 Action turn to 1 minute, depending on the system.
   Hackers may crash AIs, AGIs, and even infomorphs
this way, but the process is more difficult. In this case,
an Opposed Infosec Test is made against the target,
who is immediately aware they are under attack. Two
consecutive tests must succeed in order to crash an AI,
three in order crash an AGI or infomorph. If successful,
the AI/infomorph immediately reboots, which generally
takes 3 Action Turns, longer if the gamemaster chooses.

ELIMINATING INTRUSION TRACES
Hackers who have avoided being Locked may attempt
to clean up all traces of their intrusion before they
exit a system. This involves erasing incriminating data
in the access and security logs, and otherwise hiding
any evidence of system tampering. This requires a
Complex Action and an Infosec Test, or an Opposed
Infosec Test if the system is actively monitored. If suc-
cessful, the intruder has wiped anything that might be
used to track them down later, such as mesh ID, etc.

HACKING VPNS
Virtual private networks (VPNs) are more challeng-
ing to hack than standard devices. Because they exist
as an encrypted network within the mesh, accessing
channels of communication within a VPN is all but
impossible with the encryption key. This means any
attempt to sniff the VPN traffic is also impossible
with the key.
  The only way to hack a VPN is to hack into a
device that is part of the VPN and running the VPN
software. Once an intruder has access to such a device,
they can attempt to access the VPN. The account the
hacker has compromised may have VPN privileges, in
which case they are in. If not, they must hack access,
requiring an Infosec Test with a Minor modifier (–10).
   Once access to the VPN is acquired, the hacker may
treat the VPN like any other network. They may hack
other devices on the VPN, sniff VPN traffic, track
other users on the VPN, research data hidden away
on the VPN, and so on.

SCRIPTING
A script is a simple program—a batch of instructions—
that a hacker can embed in a system to be executed at
a later pre-scheduled time or upon a certain trigger
event, even without the hacker being present. When
activated, the script will undertake a number of system
operations limited by the abilities of the operating
system and the access rights the hacker had when
they implemented the script in the system. Scripts are

%%% txt/263.txt
a great way for a hacker to subvert a system without
necessarily being in danger when they do it.
   Scripts can be programmed on the fly or prepro-
grammed. When composing the script, the character
must detail what system operations the set will call
for, in what order and at what times (or at what trig-
ger steps). The script cannot contain more steps/tasks
than the character’s Programming skill ÷ 10 (round
down). To program a script, the character must suc-
ceed in a Programming Test with a timeframe deter-
mined by the gamemaster.
   To load the script, the character must have suc-
cessfully intruded in the system and must succeed
in an Infosec Test (or an Opposed Infosec Test if the
system is actively monitored). If successful, the script
is loaded into the system and will run as programmed.
   Once the script is activated, it carries out the pre-
programmed sequence of actions. The programmer’s
Infosec skill is used for any tests those actions call for.
   Inactivated scripts may be detected in a security
audit, just like backdoors (p. 260).


           Sarlo has infiltrated a security system and wants
           to arrange it so that a particular security sensor
           deactivates and a door unlocks at a set time, al-
           lowing his team to infiltrate a high-security area.
           He creates a script that will activate at 2200 hours
           with the following steps:
           1) At 2200 hours, disable security sensor
           2) Then unlock door
 EXAMPLE




           3) At 2230 relock door
           4) Then re-enable security sensor
           5) Eliminate traces
              This script has 5 steps, which Sarlo can handle
           with his Programming skill of 70. Sarlo succeeds in
           his Programming and Infosec Tests, and the script
           is loaded. It will then activate at the appropriate
           time. Since Sarlo’s account did not have access
           rights to perform these actions, each will require
           an Infosec Test using Sarlo’s skill to succeed.




CYBERBRAIN HACKING
Pods and synthmorphs (including some bots and ve-
hicles) are equipped with cybernetic brains. While this
technology allows a transhuman ego to sleeve into and
control these forms, they carry the disadvantage of being
vulnerable to hacking, like any other electronic device.
   Cyberbrains are not wireless-enabled for security
reasons, but they do have access jacks (p. 306) and
are directly linked to mesh inserts. This means that
in order to hack a cyberbrain, the hacker either must
have direct physical access to the morph’s body in
order to jack in, or they must first hack into the mesh
inserts and then break into the cyberbrain from there.
   Due to their importance, cyberbrains are equipped
with numerous hard-coded security features that make
intrusion very difficult. Apply a –30 modifier to all
attempts to hack into and subvert a cyberbrain. (Note
that the –30 modifier for hacking an admin account
does not apply to cyberbrains.)
  Cyberbrains are treated just like other systems for
intrusion and subversion purposes, but since they
house the morph’s controlling ego they present several
unique hacking opportunities.

ENTRAPMENT
An intruding character can attempt to lock in an ego,
preventing it from evacuating the cyberbrain. The
hacker (with the –30 modifier noted above) must
beat the defending character or muse in an Opposed
Infosec Test. If successful, the ego is prevented from
transferring itself to another system.
  To fully pen the ego in, the ego character and its
protecting muse must also be locked out (p. 257) from
controlling the cyberbrain’s system, otherwise the ego
could potentially be freed.
   Trapped egos are quite vulnerable. They could, for
example, be subject to enforced uploading, enforced
forking, or psychosurgery.

MEMORY HACKING
All cyberbrains incorporate mnemonic augmentation
(p. 307), or digitally recorded memories. A hacker
who has accessed the cyberbrain can read, alter, or
delete these memories with a successful Research or
Interfacing Test (the –30 modifier applies).

PUPPETEERING
Cyberbrains also incorporate a puppet sock (p. 307),
enabling remote users to take over the pod or synth-
morph body and control it via teleoperation or jam-
ming (p. 196). This allows a hacker to seize control
of the body and manipulate it remotely. To do so, the
hacker must take a Complex Action and beat the de-
fending character or muse in an Opposed Infosec Test;
the hacker suffers the –30 modifier noted above.
   A defender who is not locked out may continue
to fight for control of the morph, using a Complex
Action. In this case, another Opposed Infosec Test
is called for. This can result in a situation where the
morph repeatedly slips control from the hacker to the
defender, or perhaps slips into a catatonic state as the
two sides battle it out.

SCORCHING
Having direct access to a cyberbrain opens the possi-
bility for certain kinds of attacks that are normally in-
feasible due to the strict content filtering that occurs on
the link between the cyberbrain and mesh inserts. One
of these possibilities is scorching—the use of damaging
                                   —the
neurofeedback algorithms to harm the victim’s mind.
   In order to make a scorching attack, the cyberbrain
intruder must deploy a scorch program. To utilize a
scorch program, the intruder must beat the defending
Ego in an Opposed Infosec Test. The –30 modifier for
cyberbrain hacking applies to the attacker.
   Several types of scorch programs exist, with dif-
ferent effects: cauterizers (damage), bedlams (stress),

%%% txt/264.txt
spasms (pain), nightmares (fear), and shutters (sensory
deprivation). These are described on p. 332 of Gear.

SHUTDOWN
If a cyberbrain is shut down (p. 257), the morph im-
mediately ceases activity, perhaps collapsing or rolling
to a stop. Pods will appear to be in a coma. The ego,
however, will be rebooted along with the cyberbrain.

TERMINATE CORTICAL STACK FEED
The cyberbrain feeds backup data to the cortical stack.
This is a one-way connection, so the cortical stack may
not be hacked, but the transfer of data may be cut off.
This termination action requires an Opposed Infosec
Test between the hacker (with the –30 modifier) and
the defender. The ego’s backup will not be updated for
as long as the connection remains off.



RADIO JAMMING
Radio jamming is a method of transmitting radio
signals that deliberate interfere with other radio
signals in order to disrupt communications. In the
highly-networked world of Eclipse Phase, intentional
jamming is often illegal, not to mention rude.
  Radio jamming does not require any special equip-
ment other than a standard wireless device, such as
an ecto or mesh inserts. Jamming can be selective
or universal. Selective jamming targets a particular
device or set of devices. In order to selectively jam,
the character must have scanned the target device(s)
(p. 251). Universal devices target all radio-equipped
devices indiscriminately.
  Jamming simply requires a Complex Action and an
Interfacing Test. If successful, affected devices within
range have their radio communications disrupted—
they are cut off from the mesh and may not commu-
nicate wirelessly. Wired devices are unaffected.
   Devices equipped by AIs will automatically attempt
to overcome jamming, which requires a Complex
Action (transhuman users may also do the same). In
this case, a Variable Opposed Test is made between
the jammer and defender. If the jammer wins, all com-
munications are blocked; if the defender wins, they
are unaffected. If both parties succeed, the defender’s
communications are impacted but not completely cut
off. The gamemaster decides how much information
the defender can get through, and how this situation
affects mesh use.

JAMMING RADAR
Jamming can also be used to interfere with radar. In
this case, if the jammer makes an Interface Test. If
successful, the radar suffers interference, imposing
a –30 modifier on all sensor-related tests. The entity
operating the radar may attempt to overcome this
interference by beating the jammer in an Opposed
Interface Test.
SIMULSPACES
Simulspaces are virtual reality environments where
the resolution advances beyond realistic high defini-
tion and into the hyper-real. The environments they
create are comprehensive and authentic illusions, from
aspects like lighting, day or lunar cycles, and weather
down to minute details and sensations. Jacking into
a simulspace is much like crossing over into a alter-
nate world or reality, which is why simulspaces have
become increasingly popular in entertainment.
   While simulspaces usually cannot harm characters
immersed in them as the sensory algorithms are not
intended to be offensive programs or routines, experi-
ences in simulspaces can have a strong psychological
impact on an ego, as the simulation is as close to
reality as you can get. A character who is “physically”
tortured within a simulspace will not be physically
harmed, but the mental stress of the experience might
still be sufficient to cause permanent traumas.

SIMULMORPHS
Characters access simulspace using an avatar-like per-
sona called a simulmorph. This simulmorph is created by
the simulspace, based on the domain rules of the simu-
lation and certain characteristics of the morph or ego
accessing the simulation. Depending on the simulation,
this simulmorph may be customizable to varying degrees.
   While interacting with the simulation, treat simul-
morphs as basic infomorphs for all rules purposes,
even if the egos are still possessing another morph
body in reality.
   When accessing a simulspace, muses are usually not
transferred into the simulation, though they can po-
tentially come along if domain rules permit it. In this
case, muses are treated as separate characters within
the simulspace with their own simulmorph body.
   Depending on the role a simulspace is intended to play
in the story, the gamemaster may want to invent “physi-
cal stats” for the simulmorph bodies, especially if the
characters are likely to spend a lot of time in the simula-
tion. These statistics can literally be made up—it is a vir-
tual reality after all, and anything goes. Alternately, the
gamemaster can simply wing it and invent any necessary
statistics on the fly as the need for them comes up.

IMMERSION
When a character immerses themselves in a simulspace,
they “become” the simulmorph. The character’s physi-
cal body, typically secluded and protected in a vat or
couch, slumps inertly. While immersed, they suffer –60
on all Perception Tests or attempts to take action with
their physical morph. Characters can enter and leave
the simulspace as will, but toggling in or out takes a
Complex Action.
  If the simulspace crashes or the character is other-
wise dumped from it, they immediately resume con-
trol of their own morph as normal. VR dumpshock is
extremely jarring, and the character suffers 1d10 ÷ 2
mental stress.

%%% txt/265.txt
EXTERNAL MESH INTERACTION
A character accessing a simulspace may still interact
with the mesh (and through it, the outside world)
assuming the domain rules allow for it. Any outside
interactions are subject to time dilation issues, how-
ever. For example, in a simulspace running faster
than real time, holding a chat with someone in out-
side meatspace is excruciatingly slow, as real-world
seconds translate into minutes in VR. If a character
wishes to directly access other mesh nodes, they must
toggle or log out of the simulspace.

SIMULSPACE RULES
Since a simulspace is an alternate world whose realism
matches reality, characters use their physical skills and
aptitudes as if they were acting in the real world with
few exceptions:

 • Though intrusion and hacking can be represented
   as another layer of the simulation, there is no
   actual hacking within the simulspace (see Hack-
   ing Simulspaces).
 • Asyncs cannot use their psi abilities in simulspace,
   though such abilities can be simulated.
 • Any “physical” damage taken in the simulspace is
   treated as “virtual” damage. While virtual injuries
   and wounds use the same mechanics, characters
   that die in a simulspace are usually simply ejected
   from the simulation. In some cases “dead” char-
   acters are brought into a white room and can
   re-enter or just watch the simulation, depending
   on the domain rules.
 • Mental stress or trauma inflicted during a simu-
   lation carries over to the ego as real Lucidity
   damage. At the gamemaster’s discretion, some
   mental stress may be reduced if the character is
   aware that they are in a simulation.

DOMAIN RULES
Anything goes in a simulspace, as dictated by
the domain rules. A simulspace may range from
approximating reality very closely to differing dras-
tically. Gravity might fluctuate, the visual light spec-
trum might not exist, characters might heal virtual
damage effortlessly, simulmorphs may be capable of
transmogrifying into other creatures, everything might
be underwater—the possibilities are endless, limited
only by imagination. In game terms, this allows the
gamemaster to make up rules on the fly.

CHEATING
As with any good game, simulspaces provide ways
to cheat. Cheats are either built into the simulspace
software or (externally) programmed in by a hacker.
Cheats allow for a character to break the domain rules
in some way. This may be a special power, a way to
alter some environmental factor (like flying), altering
the time dilation, some sort of power-up ability, a
way to get info on other simulmorphs, or a short-cut
through part of the simulation. In game terms, cheats
might provide bonus modifiers to certain skill or stat
tests made by a simulmorph. Cheating is usually for-
bidden. Players who cheat in a simulspace game and
who get caught may face eviction from the simulspace.

HACKING SIMULSPACES
Since simulspaces are complex virtual environments
and often run on time dilation, hackers cannot hack
them in a normal manner when they participate in the
simulation. There are ways to affect and influence the
simulation from within, but the degree of subversion
that is achievable is limited. For this reason, hackers
rarely enter into VR to hack. Hacking into the exter-
nal system running a simulspace is just like breaking
into any other system. Use all of the standard rules for
intrusion and subversion.

MEDDLING FROM THE INSIDE
Within a simulspace, a hacker’s only choice for inter-
acting with the VR controls is through the standard
interface that any simulmorph can pull up. Typically
used for standard user features like adjusting your
simulmorph or chatting with or checking the status

 of other users, a clever hacker might find some ways
 to subvert the system. Such options are usually lim-
 ited, however, as a number of system controls and
 processes cannot be accessed and manipulated from
 the inside.
    Most of the hacker’s options are going to involve
 meddling with the simulation and its specific domain
 rules or possibly gaining access to cheats. To make a
 change requires a successful Interface Test. Ultimately
 the gamemaster decides what the hacker can and
 cannot get away with, based on the limitations of that
 particular simulspace.
    Most simulspaces are monitored to prevent cheat-
 ing and abuse, though the monitors are typically pre-
 occupied with maintaining the simulspace as a whole,
 dealing with other users, etc. At the gamemaster’s
 discretion, such a monitor might get to make an Inter-
 face Test (possibly with a modifier for distraction) to
 notice the hacker’s efforts.



 AIS AND MUSES
AIs are sentient but specialized programs. Like other
software, they must be run on a computerized system.
Most AIs are run on bots, vehicles, and other com-
puterized devices where they can assist transhuman
users or operate the machine themselves. They are also
commonly used to actively monitor computer systems
against intrusion attempts. Muses are AIs that special-
ize as personal companions, always at a character’s
virtual side every since they were a child.
   Sample AIs and muses can be found on p. 331 of Gear.

 AI LIMITATIONS
AIs feature a number of built-in restrictions and
limitations. To start with, they can be loaded in the
cyberbrains of pods and synthmorphs, but they may
not be downloaded into biomorph brains. As software,
they use the same rules as other software and may be
shut down, restarted, copied, erased, stored as inert
data, infected with virii, and reprogrammed. Due to
their size and complexity, only one AI (or infomorph)
may be run on a personal computer at a time (see
Computer Capabilities, p. 247), and they may not run
on peripheral devices.
  While they possess cognition and intelligence, they
are incapable of self-improvement and cannot expand
their programming and skills on their own. Although
ACE FROM WITHIN

r the simulation


   they are not able to learn they do possess memory
   storage that grants them the ability to remember and
   a limited form of adaptation. AIs do not earn Rez
   Points, nor do they have Moxie.
     AIs have aptitudes no greater than 20 but are
   incapable of defaulting. If they don’t possess a skill,
   they don’t know how to do it. (At the gamemaster’s
   discretion, they may default to field skills or similar
   skills as noted on p. 173 with a –10 to –30 modifier).
   They can use skills like any character in Eclipse Phase,
   however they may not possess any Active skill at a
   rating higher than 40 or Knowledge skill higher than
   90—the maximum amount of expertise that their skill
   software allows.
     While AIs are programmed with personality tem-
   plates and empathy, they are generally less emotive
   and difficult to read (apply a –30 modifier to Kinesics
   Test made against them, when in pod bodies). When
   combined with non-expressive synthetic morphs, they
   are even more difficult (–60 modifier). Some AIs lack
   emotive capabilities altogether and are impossible to
   read with Kinesics skill.
     AIs do have a Lucidity and Trauma Threshold stat,
   and are capable of suffering mental stress and traumas.

   COMMANDING AIS
   AIs and muses are programmed to accept commands
   from authorized users. In some circumstances, they
   may also be programmed to follow the law or some
   ethical code. Programming is never perfect, however,
   and AIs can be quite clever in how they interpret
   commands and act on them. In most cases, an AI will
   rarely refuse to follow a request or obey a command.
   Given that they also usually have a duty to protect the
   person commanding them, the AI may be reluctant to
   follow commands that could be construed as danger-
   ous or having a negative impact on the user. Under
   certain circumstances, preprogrammed imperatives
   can force an AI to ignore or disobey their owner’s
   commands (gamemaster’s discretion).



   AGIS AND INFOMORPHS
   The term “infomorph” is used to refer to any ego in
   digital body, whether that be an AGI or the digital
   emulation of a biological mind (including backups
   and forks). The following rules apply to infomorph
   and AGI characters.

%%% txt/267.txt
ROLEPLAYING MUSES
Muses should not be viewed as a mere tool for
getting extra skills, but as an opportunity to
enhance roleplaying. Though typical muse AIs
are not complete intelligences (though they can
be, see Infomorphs as Muses), their personality
matrix is often quite sophisticated and they are
very good at adapting to their user’s personality
quirks. On the other hand, they share the same
Real World Naiveté (p. 151) as AGI characters
when it comes to understanding all the facets
of transhuman behavior, social interaction,
body language, or emotion. Their personalities
are more non-human, abstract, alien, and less
passionate than transhuman life forms, often
leading to conceptual misunderstandings and
miscommunications. Likewise, their creative
capacities are limited, instead bolstered by an
ability to calculate odds, run simulations and
evaluate outcomes, and make predictions based
on previous experiences.
   Depending on the user’s stance towards sen-
tient programs, muses can be viewed as intel-
ligent toys, followers, servants, slaves, friends,
or pets, which should somehow be reﬂected in
game play. Most transhumans have also acquired
a tendency to bond with a muse mentally due to
its omnipresence and devotion to the user (like
bonding to a child or puppy that then grows to
be an adult). Therefore the subversion or even
destruction of a muse personality is sometimes
even equated with rape or murder.              ■




  SOFTWARE MINDS
 At their core, infomorphs are just programs and so
 they are treated like other software in terms of rules.
 They must be run on a specific personal computer or
 server (see Computer Capabilities, p. 247). If that
 device is shut down, the infomorph also shuts down
 into a state of unconsciousness, restarting along with
 the device (infomorphs may also shut themselves
 down, though it is rare that they do so). If the device is
 destroyed, the infomorph is killed along with it (unless
 their data can somehow be extracted from any surviv-
 ing components, perhaps resulting in a vapor, p. 274).
 Infomorphs may copy themselves, though in some
 places this is illegal and in most places is frowned
 upon as it raises numerous ethical and legal questions.
 For this reason many infomorphs that copy and trans-
 fer themself to run on a new device will thoroughly
 erase themselves off the old one.
   As digital beings, infomorphs have no physical
 mind, but it is a simple matter for them to possess
 an uninhabited synthmorph, taking up residence in
 the cyberbrain (see Resleeving Synthmorphs, p. 271).
  INFOMORPHS AS
  MUSES
  Instead of relying on underdeveloped muses for
  aid and companionship, characters may prefer to
  have a full-ﬂedged digital intelligence at their
  side, whether that be an AGI, a backed-up bio-
  logical ego, or fork of the character’s own per-
  sonality. Alternately, a character with a ghostrider
  module (p. 307) could have both, carrying a muse
  in their mesh inserts and an infomorph in the
  ghostrider module.
    This possibility is very useful for infomorph
  player characters, as they can ride along in some-
  one’s head and participate in team affairs with-
  out needing a morph of their own.                 ■



They may also download into biomorph bodies ac-
cording to standard resleeving rules (p. 271). Even
when disembodied, they may interact with the
physical world via the mesh, viewing through sensors,
streaming XP feeds, communicating with characters,
commanding slaved devices, and teleoperating/jam-
ming drones.
   Infomorphs have a Speed of 3, reflecting their digi-
tal nature and their ability to act at electronic speeds.
If an infomorph sleeves into a body, however, it takes
on the Speed of that morph.

AGI CHARACTERS
Though AGIs were not born in a biological body, their
programming encompasses the full spectrum of human
personality, outlook, emotions, and mental states. AGIs
are in fact raised in a manner similar to human chil-
dren, so that they are socialized much like humans are.
Nevertheless, on a fundamental level they are non-hu-
mans programmed to act human. There are inevitably
points where the programming does not mask or alter
the fact that AGIs often possess or develop personality
traits and idiosyncrasies that are quite different from
human norms and often outright alien.
   Unlike standard crippled AIs, AGIs are capable of
full-fledged creativity, learning, and self-improvement
(at a slow but steady pace equivalent to humans). Just
like other characters, they earn Rez points and may
improve their skills and capabilities. AGIs suffer none
of the skill limitations placed on weak AIs, using skills
just like any other character.
   On an emotional level, AGIs run emotional subrou-
tines that are comparable to biological human emo-
tions. AGIs are, in fact, programmed to have empathy
and share an interest in human affairs and prosperity,
and to place significant relevance on life of all kinds.
In game terms, AGIs emote like humans (and so Kine-
sics may be used against them) and are vulnerable to
emotionally manipulative effects, fear, etc.

ERATED FUTURE
 The future setting of Eclipse Phase introduces a
 number of technological elements that have a strong
 impact on transhuman society. These include backups
 and uploading, resleeving, egocasting, forking, nano-
 fabrication, reputation systems, space habitats, and
 space travel, among others.



 BACKUPS AND UPLOADING
 The transhuman mind is no longer a prisoner of the
 biological hardware on which it originates. Through
 various mechanisms, biological brains may be digitally
 emulated, allowing people to make a backup of their
 minds, including their entire personality, memories,
 and skills—a process known as uploading.
   The primary use of backups is to ensure the person’s
 ego can be retrieved in case of death, in which case
 they may be resleeved (p. 271). For this reason, almost
 everyone in the solar system is equipped with a corti-
 cal stack (p. 300). Backups may also be safely archived
 in secure storage (p. 269) or used to create infomorphs
 (p. 264). A person may also egocast themselves across
 the solar system as a form of travel (p. 276).

 CORTICAL STACK BACKUPS
 Cortical stack implants deploy a network of nano-
 bots throughout the brain that take a snapshot of
 the mind’s neural state, storing the data as a backup
 within the cortical stack. The average transhuman’s
 cortical stack backs up their ego 86,400 times per day.
 Only the most recent backup is kept within the stack;
 older ones are overwritten. Pods and synthmorphs
 also can be equipped with cortical stacks (though
 AI-piloted bots often lack this feature), though these
 versions maintain an updated copy of the ego running
 in the morph’s cyberbrain.
    In the case of death, accidental or otherwise, a cor-
 tical stack can be retrieved from a corpse and used to
 recover the character, either as an infomorph or by
 resleeving them in a new morph. Cortical stacks are
 diamond-hardened and protected, so they may often
 be retrieved even if the corpse is badly mangled or
 damaged. If the corpse cannot be recovered or the
 cortical stack is destroyed, the backup is lost.
    High rollers, well-equipped brinkers, and others
 in dangerous professions often opt for an emergency
 farcaster accessory (p. 306) that periodically (usually
 every 48 hours, but varying according to contract)
 transmits a backup from the cortical stack to a remote
 storage facility. This option is quite expensive, how-
 ever, and so is generally only afforded by the wealthy.

 RETRIEVING A CORTICAL STACK
 Most cortical stacks are carefully excised from a
 corpse with surgery. In certain circumstances, however,
AR■GEAR■GEAR■GEAR■GEAR■GEAR■
                      ■GEAR■
                       GEAR■

                                                                10


  a character may need to extract a cortical stack in the
  field, whether because transporting the corpse is im-
  practical or because the dead person is an enemy and
  they either don’t want them knowing who killed them
  or they want to interrogate them with psychosurgery
  in a simulspace.
     The process of cutting out a cortical stack is called
 “popping,” as a skilled extractor can usually get the
  smooth-shelled implant to pop right out by making
  an incision in the correct place and applying pressure.
  One does need to be careful that the tiny, blood-slick
  stack doesn’t slip away once popped.
     Popping can be done with a sharp knife and elbow
  grease, though it is grisly. Popping a stack is a Task
 Action that requires a Medicine: [any appropriate
  field] Test with a timeframe of 1 minute and a modi-
  fier of +20. Morphs with stacks in non-standard loca-
  tions or with anatomical shielding (carapace plates,
  etc.) around the stack may incur penalties to this test
  at the gamemaster’s discretion. Of course, if you don’t
  have the time for a precise extraction, you can always
  just cut the entire head off and take it with you.
     Once a cortical stack is retrieved, it may be loaded
  into an ego bridge (p. 328) and used to bring the ego
  back, either as an infomorph or by resleeving.
     Living Subjects: Cortical stacks may be excised
  from living people, but the process is usually fatal (or
  at least paralyzing) as it involves cutting through the
  spinal column. If the target is not unconscious or oth-
  erwise incapacitated, they must first be immobilized
  in melee combat (see Subdual, p. 204). Cutting out
  the stack is handled like a Medicine Task Action as
  above, but this process inflicts 3d10 + 10 damage on
  the target. If the test fails, they still inflict 1d10 + 10
  damage to the target. If the person removing the stack
 wants to leave the target alive or harm them as little
  as possible, they suffer a –20 modifier on the test, but
  may reduce the damage by 1d10 per 10 full points of
  MoS. Living through the process of having your stack
  removed is traumatic; anyone who does so suffers
 1d10 mental stress.

  DESTROYING A CORTICAL STACK
  Cortical stacks have an Armor of 20 and a Durability
  of 20 for anyone attempting to destroy them.

  UPLOADING
  Uploading a backup into secure storage is usually
  handled with a brain scan at the storage facility’s clinic
  using a bread box-sized unit called an ego bridge (p.
  328). When activated, the ego bridge’s sensor array
  twists open like a morning glory blossom, revealing an
  enclosure with a neck rest that automatically adjusts
  itself to morphs with oddly-sized or -shaped heads.
  The neck rest deploys millions of specialized nanobots

%%% txt/271.txt
into the brain and central nervous system. The petals
are full of sensors that image the brain using a combi-
nation of MRI, sonogram, and positional information
broadcast by the nanobot swarm in the morph’s brain.
The ego bridge then builds a digital copy of the per-
son’s brain, which is stored away in the service’s highly
secure, off-the-mesh, hardwired data vaults.
   In the case of pods, the ego bridge scans the biologi-
cal brain bits and also accesses the cyberbrain to copy
the parts of the ego residing there. For synthmorphs,
who have no biological brain, the process is much
simpler, as it simply requires accessing and making a
copy of their cyberbrain.
   In a standard clinic with an undamaged morph, up-
loading takes only 10 minutes, 5 with a pod. In other
situations, however, the process may take longer if the
gamemaster so decides. Uploading from a synthmorph
or extracted cortical stack is instantaneous. The ego
bridge largely operates itself. While oversight by a
medical specialist is a good idea, no test is necessary.
   If an uploading character does not plan to return
to their morph, it is usually put on ice until someone
else resleeves into it. If a new resleeve is not ready
and the uploading character doesn’t want to leave a
potential copy of themselves behind, they can have
the morph’s mind wiped by the nanobots as part of
the uploading process.

UPLOADING-RESLEEVING CONTINUITY
In ideal circumstances, a person who is intentionally
resleeving (p. 271) can arrange for the uploading and
resleeving process to occur with any noticeable loss of
continuity. Though the experience of switching from
one morph to another is still a bit jarring, the transi-
tion itself can be made into a seamless process, with
no gaps in awareness or memory, which helps reduce
associated mental stress.
   In this case, during the process of uploading, the
ego bridge is also connected to another ego bridge
and the new sleeve. This connection can even be made
wirelessly or by farcaster link (with a maximum dis-
tance of 10,000 kilometers).
   As the mind is uploaded, the ego bridge builds a
virtual brain by copying the morph’s brain bit by bit,
using the data gained from the brain scan. At the same
time, this data is slowly copied to the new sleeve as
nanobots rewire the sleeve’s brain structure (a much
slower process). As the transfer occurs, the nanobots
in the brain sever individual neural connections and
re-route them to their duplicates in the virtual brain,
and then eventually to the new brain. Effectively, the
character’s ego is running partially on the meat brain
and partially on the virtual copy. By the time the nano-
bots sever the last of the neural connections in the
old brain, the ego is running completely on the virtual
brain and the new sleeve’s brain. Once the resleeving
is completed, the virtual brain is shut down.
   In terms of perceptions, the character, who is awake
during this process, experiences a very gradual shift
from one morph to the other. As the process takes
hours, however (or even longer if done via farcaster),
the subject usually entertains themselves with some
AR media, VR, or even XP to pass the time.

UPLOADING AFTER DEATH
It is possible to upload the mind of a person who has
recently died as long as the nanobots have time to scan
the brain before cell deterioration kicks in too heavily,
which takes approximately 2 hours. It is possible to
sustain a corpse for longer by placing it in a healing
vat (p. 326) for nanostasis. Post-death uploads may
suffer integrity damage; see Backup Complications, p.
270.
   Cyberbrains may also be retrieved from a destroyed
synthmorph and reactivated, assuming they are not
damaged too heavily (gamemaster discretion).

DESTRUCTIVE UPLOADING
Though rare, some people engage in a process called
destructive uploading, where the biological brain is liter-
ally sliced apart and scanned piece by piece. Considered
abhorrent and wasteful by most transhumans, “brain-
peeling” is practiced by some bioconservative factions
who view it as the only “pure” method of uploading
or the only real way to transfer the “soul.” Such people
typically refuse to resleeve, living out the rest of their
lives as infomorphs, quite often in dedicated simulspaces
that are treated as a sort of virtual afterlife.

BACKUP INSURANCE
Almost everyone, with the exception of neo-primitivists
and very young children, has a cortical stack. In the
event of death, however, a cortical stack alone will not
ensure resurrection unless you have acquired backup
insurance (p. 330) to cover the costs of your resleev-
ing. Going without backup insurance for any length of
time is taking a severe risk. Some jurisdictions (such
as the Titanian Commonwealth) have a practice of
bringing everyone back, even if only to an infomorph
state, or at least filing the most recent backup away
in dead storage just in case someone decides to pay
to resurrect them later. Other authorities will simply
destroy the stack or, worse, sell it on the black market
to a soul-trading syndicate such as Nine Lives.
  Backup insurance typically includes a subscription
to an uploading facility, usually requiring a visit every
6 months, to ensure that backup is held in safe stor-
age in case of cortical stack loss. People with risky
jobs (construction bot supervisor, hypercorp exo-
planet staff, girl who fights vicious giant eels for rich
jaded audiences, etc.) may back up once a week, or
even daily. In the event of a verified death where the
cortical stack could not be retrieved, the most recent
backup is used to resleeve the person.
  At the basic level, backup insurance will bring the
character back as an infomorph, at which point they
can access their credit and purchase a new morph.
More expensive versions will automatically resleeve

%%% txt/272.txt
you in the pre-purchased morph of your choice. The
exceedingly rich will often have customized clones
(often of their original body) waiting on ice for them.
  Backup insurance often involves a missing person
clause, which states that a person will be brought
back if they have not checked in for X amount of time
(a calendar function automatically handled by your
muse) and cannot be located.
   It is worth noting that some criminal syndicates
also offer backup insurance at a much reduced rate.
The likelihood that copies of your backup are being
used for illicit purposes, however, is quite high. For
some people, however, what happens to a copy of
themselves is of no concern.

BACKUP INSURANCE LIMITATIONS
Backup insurance is not always perfect. Though in-
surance providers are required to make a reasonable
effort to retrieve your cortical stack, for many hyper-
corps this is a simple cost-benefit analysis that often
will not work in the character’s favor. If you died in a
dangerous area such as the Zone on Mars, in a remote
area such as the Kuiper Belt, or are simply difficult
to track down (pushed out an airlock somewhere),
odds are against your cortical stack being retrieved—
instead you will be re-instanced from a backup.
   Jurisdiction can also play an important role. The
insurance offered by many inner system providers is
automatically nullified if you travel to an anarchist
habitat, gatecrash, break the law, or engage in certain
life-threatening activities like suicide sports or scaveng-
ing in TITAN-infected ruins. At the least, they will
refuse to retrieve your stack in these circumstances.
Likewise, if you struck a backup insurance deal with
a medical collective from an autonomist habitat and
then go and die on a hypercorp station, the hypercorp
is very likely to refuse to recognize the authority of a
bunch of anarchists and won’t hand your stack over.
   Even an archived backup and a missing person
clause is no guarantee. A determined enemy could
capture you, pry the backup insurance access codes
from your muse, keep you on ice or quietly kill you,
and then regularly “check in” on your behalf using
the access codes so that the insurance provider never
realizes you are dead or missing. Though this requires
quite a bit of effort, it is often less difficult than deal-
ing with an immortal opponent who keeps coming
back no matter how often you kill them.
  Other dangers also exist. An entire habitat may be
destroyed, taking you, your backups, and your insur-
ance provider’s records with it. A resourceful enemy
might penetrate a provider’s security and delete your
backups, or simply bribe the right people to make
sure they get “accidentally” corrupted. Given these
possibilities, the paranoid often make sure to get
multiple redundant backup policies, assuming they
can afford it.

BACKUP COMPLICATIONS
In most cases, backing up/uploading is risk free unless
someone tampers with the equipment. If the character
suffered brain or neurological damage, the backup is
transferred via farcasting, or the upload is made from
a dead character, then the backup may be damaged
due to missing neural information. In any of these
instances, make a LUC Test for the character. If the
test fails, they suffer 1 point of mental stress per 10
full points of MoF. Note that this stress (and pos-
sible) trauma applies to the backup, not the original
character. If the backup is used to re-instantiate the
character, however, then the stress is applied.



RESLEEVING
Resleeving (also called remorphing) is the process
of giving a new body to an ego. Changing bodies
is a normal part of life for hundreds of millions of
transhumans, and it is an even more frequent occur-
rence for people in certain professions. Characters
involved in specialized work may resleeve as often as
once a month. Those who travel frequently may do so
even more often. Also, given the number of infugees

%%% txt/273.txt
  who died during the Fall but have now acquired a
  new morph, the vast majority of transhumanity has
  resleeved at least once. As such, most transhumans are
  accustomed to resleeving.
    Adjusting to a new body takes time and a bit of
  effort (see Integration, p. 272). Resleeving is also diffi-
  cult psychologically, as reflected by continuity (p. 272)
  and alienation (p. 272).
    Once an ego fully inhabits a new morph, the new
  morph’s cortical stack needs ten minutes to amass a
  complete backup of the ego.

  RESLEEVING BIOMORPHS AND PODS
  Resleeving takes about an hour in a properly equipped
  clinic. In essence, the process works like uploading in
  reverse. The new sleeve is hooked up to an ego bridge
  which infiltrates the brain with nanobots that physi-
  cally restructure the brain’s neural structure and con-
  nections according to the map provided by the backup.
  Sleeving takes six times as long as uploading because
  the nanobot swarm working as a wet printer in the
  template brain needs to duplicate the entire physical
  structure of the ego’s neural network. For resleeving, a
 “wet” ego bridge is used, meaning that the sleeve and
  ego bridge are submerged in a vat filled with nanogel.
     The resleeving process for pods takes only half an hour,
  as pods brains are half biological and half cyberbrain.

  RESLEEVING SYNTHMORPHS
  Resleeving into the cyberbrain of a synthmorph is much
  easier and quicker, being a matter of copying the backup
  into the cyberbrain (an instantaneous affair) and then
  running the backup in its virtual brain state (1 Action
  Turn). The drawback to synthmorphs is that they are
  more difficult to acclimate to (see Integration, p. 272),

   synthmorphs are viewed as low class in some cultures.

   EVACUATING A CYBERBRAIN
   Characters inhabiting a synthmorph cyberbrain may
   voluntarily choose to evacuate by copying themselves
   as an infomorph onto another device. This takes 1 full
   Action Turn. See Infomorph Resleeving, p. 273.

    RESLEEVING COSTS
   The costs involved for the resleeving process itself are
   generally subsumed in the costs of the backup insur-
   ance and/or the new sleeve itself. Costs for individual
   morphs are noted in the descriptions starting on p.
   139. See Morph Brokerage (p. 276) for rules on find-
   ing and acquiring morphs.

    INTEGRATION
    Getting used to a new body typically takes some time.
   The character must become acclimated to the changes
    in height, weight, sex, and capabilities, which often
    requires unlearning ways of doing things that worked
    fine for their previous form. Resleeving in a synthetic
    morph or an uplift is also quite confusing at first,
    given the drastically different morphologies, change in
    limb structure (and sometimes amount of limbs), and
    so on. Luckily, transhuman minds are adaptive things,
    and this process is aided by the application of mental
   “patches” during the resleeving process that give the
    character a bit of a boost for using their new body.
       An ego in a new morph makes an Integration Test
    upon taking control of the body, rolling SOM x 3 (morph
    bonuses do not apply) and applying modifiers from the
    Integration and Alienation Modifiers table. The result of
    the test is explained on the Integration Test table, p. 272.

Best. Morph. Ever. The new morph jives perfectly with the character’s

heals 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) stress points.
ALIENATION
After loss of continuity, the other major factor impact-
ing resleeving characters is alienation. Once the ego
has its new sleeve under control, it’s time to look in
the mirror. The alienation test reflects the experience of
coming to terms with a new face, skin, and brain. For
example, transferring to a radically different morph
(such as a swarmanoid) can be difficult to grasp.
Uplifts often have difficulty getting acquainted with
the differing hormonal urges of a human biomorph
and vice versa. While the character’s ego is as it was
in their last sleeve, the brains and neurochemistry of
many morphs may alter aptitudes like WIL or COG.
The effects of this can be frustrating or disorienting.
  Every character makes an Alienation Test to reflect
how mentally stressful it is to get a grip on their new
body, rolling INT x 3 and apply modifiers from the
Integration and Alienation Modifiers table. Consult
the Alienation Test table to determine the effects.

CONTINUITY TEST
Perhaps the biggest shock that strikes most resleeving
characters is the loss of continuity of self. This is par-
ticularly true for characters who died. If their cortical
stack was retrieved, they will remember their own
death. If they were restored from an archived backup,
they will not remember their death, but they will have
lost an entire period of their life—all the way back to
their last backup. In fact, if their body was not recov-
ered, they may not even know that they are dead for
certain—there may be a surviving copy of themselves
out there. The driving point in this loss of continuity is
a sort of existential crisis—they are no longer the origi-
nal person they once were. This leads some to question
whether they are who they think they are, or are they
some poor imitation and not a real person at all?
   To determine how this loss of continuity affects a
character, make a Continuity Test by rolling WIL x 3.
Every character suffers stress from loss of continuity,
as noted on the Continuity Stress table. Reduce this
stress damage by 1 point per 10 full points of MoS on
the Continuity Test, or increase it by 1 point for every
10 full points of MoF.

INFOMORPH RESLEEVING
Rather than resleeving into a physical body, a backup
may instead by instantiated as an infomorph, a purely
digital form. Infomorphs are distinct from backups in
that backups are inert files. Infomorphs are backups
imprinted onto a virtual brain template and run as
a program. This virtual brain state must be run on a
specific device and follows all of the rules noted for
infomorphs on p. 264. Infomorphs may copy them-
selves to other devices, typically erasing themselves
from the previous device as they go. Infomorphs that
copy without erasing are treated as forks.
  Characters instantiating as infomorphs must make
Continuity and Alienation Tests, just like resleeving.
  Infomorphs may be resleeved into physical morphs,
following normal resleeving rules.

FORKING AND MERGING
With all of these backups of transhuman minds on
file and an abundance of mesh space on which to run
them as virtual brains, one might wonder what’s to
stop post-Fall transhumanity from multiplying its
numbers by running additional copies of them. The
short answer is: nothing, aside from massive social
stigma and thorny psychological issues. Taking a
backup of a transhuman mind, copying it, and re-
instancing it as an infomorph is called forking. It’s one
of the most useful and still-controversial applications
of transhumanity’s brain science.
   There are four classifications of forks: alpha, beta,
delta, and gamma. Though typically copied as info-
morphs, there is nothing preventing a fork from being
sleeved in a physical morph as well, other than legali-
ties and custom.

ALPHA FORKS
An alpha fork is an exact copy of the original ego,
re-instanced as a separate infomorph. An alpha fork
may be created by copying and running an infomorph
(from a backup, infomorph, synthmorph cyberbrain,
or directly from the cortical stack). Alpha forks are an
exact copy of the character’s ego, with all of the same
skills, memories, stats, traits, personality, etc. New
alpha forks must make an Alienation Test (p. 272),
and possibly a Continuity Test (p. 272) if copied from
a backup.
   Creating alpha forks is illegal in many jurisdic-
tions, including most of the inner system and the
Jovian Republic. In others it tends to be viewed with
distaste, though there are some habitats/cultures in
which it is encouraged.

BETA FORKS
Beta forks are partial copies of the ego. They are
intentionally hobbled so as to not to be considered
an equal to the character, for legal and other reasons.
Beta forks have most of the same skills as the original
ego, though sometimes reduced. Their memories are

 also drastically curtailed, usually tailored to whatever
 task they are intended to perform.
   Beta forks are created by a process known as
 neural pruning (p. 274). They are legal and even
 common in many places, except for bioconservative
 holdouts like the Jovian Republic, though delta forks
 are more favored. Beta forks rarely have anything
 resembling civil rights or citizenship and are usually
 treated as the property of the originating ego. They
 are commonly used as digital aids or to represent the
 original ego when communicating with others over
 great distances.
   A beta fork’s stats are determined as follows:

  • Reduce all aptitudes by 5 (to a minimum of 1).
    This affects all skills as well. Likewise, this re-
    duces LUC by 10 and INIT by 20.
  • Active skills have a maximum value of 60.
  • Moxie is reduced to 1.
  • The Psi trait is removed. At the gamemaster’s dis-
    cretion, other traits may no longer apply as well.

   Additional changes may apply as determined by
 the neural pruning test. Beta forks take 1 minute
 to generate.

 DELTA FORKS
Delta forks are extremely limited copies of an ego.
They are more akin to AI templates upon which
the ego’s surface personality traits are imprinted.
Also created via neural pruning, delta forks are
highly functional (as competent as a beta fork or
AI) but have extremely limited skills and heav-
ily edited memories, usually to the point of being
functional amnesiacs.
   A delta fork’s stats are determined as follows:

  • Reduce all aptitudes by 10 (to a minimum of 1).
    This affects all skills as well. Likewise, this re-
    duces LUC by 20 and INIT by 40.
  • Active skills have a maximum value of 40. The
    fork may have no more than 5 Active skills.

%%% txt/276.txt
 • Knowledge skills have a maximum of 80. The
   fork may have no more than 5 Knowledge skills.
 • Moxie is reduced to 0.
 • The Psi trait is removed. At the gamemaster’s dis-
   cretion, other traits may no longer apply as well.

  Additional changes may apply as determined by the
neural pruning test. Delta forks take 1 Action Turn to
generate.

GAMMA FORKS
More commonly known as vapors, gamma forks are
massively incomplete, corrupted, or heavily damaged
copies of an ego. Vapors are not intentionally cre-
ated and are instead the results of botched uploads,
scrambled backups, incomplete or jammed farcasts,
or infomorphs/forks that were somehow damaged or
went insane. It is extremely rare for anyone to pur-
posely create a vapor for anything other than research
use, although they can crop up in some interesting
places. For example, poorly made skill software occa-
sionally includes enough of the personality traits and
memories of the person the skill was taken from that
it can behave in a vapor-like fashion when used.
   Because vapors are anomalies rather than purpose-
ful creations, the characteristics of individual gamma
forks are left to the gamemaster. They should have
some or all of the following: reduced skills, reduced
aptitudes, incomplete or incoherent memories, nega-
tive mental traits, and persistent mental stress or trau-
mas, including derangements and/or disorders.

NEURAL PRUNING
Most forking is done on the fly—something comes up
that the character needs a fork for, so they whip one
up on the spot. Neural pruning is the art of taking a
backup/infomorph and trimming it down to size so
that it functions as either a beta or delta fork.
   Beta forks are created by taking a virtual mind state
that is intentionally inhibited and filtering a copy of
the ego through it. Like a topiary shrub, the portions
of the character’s neural network that exceed the ca-
pacities of the intended fork are trimmed away. In ad-
dition to the changes noted under Beta Forks (p. 273),
characters may voluntarily choose to delete/decrease
skills and remove memories.
   Delta forks are created by excising the ego’s surface
personality traits and applying them to an AI template.
In this case the ego’s memories are usually excluded
entirely—it is easier to start with a blank delta fork
and feed them the specific memories/knowledge they
need. As with beta forks, characters making delta
forks may voluntarily choose to delete/decrease skills
and keep specific memories.
   Transhumanity’s grasp of neuroscience extends to
scanning and copying a mind, but the most intricate
workings of memory are still imperfectly understood.
Making precise edits to individual portions of a neural
network (to alter recollections, skills, and the like) is
still a black art. The difficulty with neural pruning is
that taking a weed whacker to the tree of memory
isn’t an exact science. Specific memories may not be
excised or chosen—at best, memories may be handled
in broad clumps, typically grouped by time periods no
finer than 6 months. For simplicity, most beta forks are
created by removing all memories older than 1 year.
   When creating a beta or delta fork, the character
must make a Psychosurgery Test (other parties may
make this test on the character’s behalf, representing
that the character is giving them access to prune the
fork appropriately). If the character succeeds, the fork
is created as desired. If the test fails, the gamemaster
chooses one of the following penalties for every 10
full points of MoF. Some of these penalties may be
combined for a cumulative effect:

  • 1 additional skill decreased by –20
  • Fork acquires a Negative mental trait worth 10 CP
  • Fork suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress
  • Extra memory loss (gamemaster discretion; beta
    forks only)
  • 1 Positive trait lost

NEURAL PRUNING WITH LONG-TERM PSYCHOSURGERY
Rather than generating forks on the fly, some char-
acters prefer to have carefully-pruned forks on hand,
stored as inert files that can be called up, copied, and
run as needed. These forks are crafted with long-term
psychosurgery, meaning that they suffer fewer draw-
backs and the memories may be more finely tuned.
  Long-term neural pruning requires a Psychosurgery
Test as above, but with a +30 modifier. Delta forks take
1 week to prune this way, beta forks take 1 month. Ad-
ditional modifications may be made to the fork using
any of the normal rules for psychosurgery (p. 229).
   It is worth noting that some people prefer to use
forks of themselves or loved ones rather than a muse.
Likewise, some wealthy hyperelites are known to keep
copies of their younger backups on hand, sometimes
for decades, and re-instance these when their prime
ego has enough skill and experience to completely
outclass its younger selves. Though technically these
are alpha forks, their lag behind the original ego is
comparable in degree to that of a beta fork. This is
rumored to be the method used by the Pax Familiae
in instancing her army of cloned selves.

HANDLING FORKS
Gamemasters are encouraged to allow players to ro-
leplay their character’s own forks. It is important to
note, however, that even with alpha forks, once the
fork and originating ego diverge, they develop onward
as separate people. The events that shape the primary
ego’s personality, character, and knowledge will not
happen—or even if they do, probably not in the same
way—to the fork, and vice versa. The exact dividing
line between an ego and a fork is a central philosophi-
cal and legal debate among many transhumans.
   This means that gamemaster should not be afraid
to pull a fork out of a player character’s hands and

%%% txt/277.txt
 make them into an NPC if they start too diverge too
 greatly. Similarly, if a fork begins to learn information
 that the main character does not (yet) have access to,
 it is probably also better to run the fork as an NPC in
 order to avoid metagaming.
    It is entirely possible that a fork might decide that
 it will no longer obey the originating ego and carry
 about doing its own thing. This usually only occurs
 with alpha forks, who are essentially a full copy
 anyway, and as time passes the idea of merging back
 with the original ego becomes unappealing. Beta and
 delta forks are quite aware of their nature as “incom-
 plete” copies, and so usually return back home to the
 ego for reintegration. In rare cases, however, even
 these might make a break for life on their own.

 MERGING
   Merging is the process of re-integrating a previous-
ly-spawned fork with the originating ego. Merging is
performed on conscious egos/forks, transferring both
to a single, merged ego. The process is not difficult
to undergo when two forks have only been apart a
short time. As forks spend more time apart, though,
merging becomes a severe mental ordeal.
   To determine if merging goes well, a Psychosurgery
Test is called for (made either by the ego or another
character overseeing the process). The Merging table
lists modifiers for this test as well as the result of suc-
cess or failure.
   For synthmorphs, merging takes one full Action
Turn. For biomorphs, an ego bridge (p. 328) or mne-
monic augmentation (p. 307) is required to merge,
and the process takes 10 minutes.
   The result of the process is a unified ego, whether
or not the Merging Test succeeds. Psychotherapy (p.
209) and psychosurgery (p. 229) can troubleshoot bad
merges over time.



 EGOCASTING
 In spite of being a spacefaring civilization with out-
 posts throughout the solar system and beyond, tran-
 shumanity makes scant use of spacecraft for interplan-
 etary travel. Shuttlecraft using a variety of propulsion
 systems make regular trips between habitats, planetary
 surfaces, and moons. But for any trip longer than 1.5
 million kilometers—the distance a fusion drive craft
 can cover in a day—people egocast.

         THE SELF
         Forking and merging have changed the way
         transhumanity thinks about the self and what
         it means to have a well-integrated personality.
            While forking is child’s play from a tech
         nological standpoint, the psychological and
         social effects of cloning a mind mean that
         most people are cautious about employing
         forks. Some jurisdictions ban forking outright
         for all but medical uses, while others have
         severe restrictions. In many hypercorp juris
         dictions, for instance, alpha forks are illegal
         and letting a beta fork run for more than 4
         hours without merging violates the modern
         descendants of 20th-century anti-trust laws
         Similarly, the Jovian Junta and other biocon
         servatives ban forking entirely.
            Disposing of unwanted forks is another
         thorny issue. In some places, it’s as simple as
         deleting them, because a stored mind has no
         legal status. In others, a fork that doesn’t wish
         to merge back with its originating ego might
         be accorded some rights, though these are
         generally only granted to alpha forks.
            Most significantly, though, running a short
         term fork of oneself for periods of an hour
         or less is an easy task for many transhumans
         Many people use forks of themselves to get
         work done in everyday life, and almost every
         one has at least experimented with forking at
         some point.
            Transhumans view forking a bit like early
         21st-century humans viewed drinking and drug
         use. A bit might be okay, but someone overdo
         ing it will be stigmatized. This is because most
         transhumans understand the psychological
         consequences of overusing forks.               ■



    Egocasting is transhumanity’s most advanced
  personal transportation technology, though only the
  character’s ego actually travels. Egocasting combines
  the technologies of uploading and quantum farcasting
  to transfer a backup (or sometimes even a conscious
  ego, see p. 269) over interplanetary distances.
    Though egocasting occurs at the speed of light,
  egocasting times vary drastically with distance.

Egocasting within a cluster or planetary system is
usually just a matter of minutes. Egocasting from the
sun to the Kuiper Belt, however, takes between 40 and
70 hours, and so egocasting all of the way across the
solar system can take even longer.
  Once an ego arrives at the destination receiver, it
can be archived, run as an infomorph, or resleeved
as normal.

EGOCASTER SECURITY
Beaming yourself across interplanetary space is a
mature technology and usually works seamlessly. Be-
cause egocasting uses quantum farcasters, there is no
danger of radio interference cooking the signal and
causing data loss. Normally the entire process is medi-
ated by the character’s backup service, and security
breaches are uncommon.
   However, there are several risks involved in ego-
casting. The most obvious is that the character’s con-
sciousness is transferred as a digital backup file at the
destination. If the egocaster on the other end is not
trusted or the networks at the destination are privately
controlled by the receiver, the character is potentially
putting themself at the mercy of their host. Most hy-
percorps consider meddling with a transmitted ego to
be a serious breach of etiquette, whereas autonomist
types would find it unthinkably repressive. However,
political extremist groups and criminal organizations
in control of egocasters suffer from fewer restraints.
   A more subtle risk is the possibility for hackers to
exploit security holes in the egocaster and its attached
virtual space to steal a fork of the character. This is
extremely difficult to do. It almost never happens
during a normal upload, because the uploading ser-
vices are security conscious to the point of paranoia.
Even so, the forks stolen by such attempts more often
than not end up being vapors, because the intruder
is usually stopped before a full copy can be obtained.
DARKCASTING
   Characters who want to egocast without the atten-
tion of public officials like Immigration and Customs
must seek out so-called darkcasting services—illegal
farcaster transceivers typically operated by criminal
syndicates and other clandestine groups. To locate
such a service, a character must use their Networking
skill and possibly their reputation (p. 285).



MORPH BROKERAGE
Morphs are a major commodity in transhuman society.
The technology and materials needed to grow new
morphs are cheap and abundant, though they take
time. Cloned biomorphs take at least a year and a half,
even with accelerated growth. Pods, which are typi-
cally pieced together from vat-grown parts, take about
6 months. Synthmorphs like cases and synths can be
produced in a day, whereas more complicated models
can take a week or more. Theoretically, supply will one
day outstrip demand to the point where flesh is free.
   Characters have several options for acquiring
morphs when they travel by egocast, suffer heavy
damage, or just feel like a new body. When egocasting,
the most common method for travelers of middling
means is to store their current morph in a body bank’s
secure facility and lease a morph at their destina-
tion. Less commonly, characters may rely on public
resleeving facilities, or, if they have the means, they
may purchase a new morph outright. Characters who
expect to stay at their destination indefinitely or who
decide to resleeve but aren’t traveling might instead
opt for a trade-in on their old body, leaving it behind
permanently in most cases.

MORPH AVAILABILITY
As noted under Resleeving and the Gamemaster (p. 271),
finding the model of morph you want is not always easy.
While many basic morph types (cases, synths, splicers)

%%% txt/279.txt
are generally available, characters can also locate new
morphs using their Networking skills (see Reputation
and Social Networks, p. 285). Certain morph types
are harder to find then others; the gamemaster should
apply an appropriate modifier for any morphs that seem
rare or unusual (for example, swarmanoids or reapers).
Likewise, some morphs may simply be unavailable in a
given locale. Rusters are rarely available off of Mars, for
example, while on Europa, most morphs are exotic local
aquatic varieties.
  The gamemaster determines which factions are able
to provide new morphs in a given locale. Factions
will not provide morphs that are unavailable to that
faction as starting characters. If the faction is not the
dominant one in that locale, a penalty should be ap-
plied, ranging from –10 to –30. Despite having a pres-
ence in a given locale, some factions may be unable to
provide morphs at all.
   If the character is seeking a customized morph with
specific implants or enhancements, the search will be
more challenging. The gamemaster should apply a –10
to –30 modifier here as well, depending on the extent
and legality of the modifications sought.

MORPH ACQUISITION
Once a morph is located, the character may call in
favors (p. 285) or pay credits for it. Morph costs are
noted on the Morph Costs table. In the inner system,
morph prices are often inflated by demand in the
market such that the most desirable morph types can
cost a small fortune. Outsystem, prices in rep are more
reasonable but still steep due to population pressures
on life support-dependent outer system settlements.
For travelers and frequent body hoppers, there are a
number of ways to defray these costs.

BROKERAGE AND MATCHMAKING
Finding morphs for travelers and the bodiless is a
 specialized skill demanding deep social networks and
a flair for negotiation. In general, it’s a seller’s market,
 so brokers (or “matchmakers,” as they’re called in
the open economy) act as agents for the person seek-
ing a body. The Morph Costs table assumes a 10%
fee paid to the broker. Characters wishing to cut out
the middleman may reduce cost by 10% but take a
–30 penalty on their Networking Test to locate an
available morph.

CUSTOMIZED MORPHS
If a character seeks to have a customized morph (with
extra bioware, cyberware, or nanoware implants or
robotic enhancements), the costs for these enhance-
ments are added to the morph’s cost (if the gamemaster
chooses, discount package deals may apply). Likewise,
morphs may come saddled with positive or negative
morph traits (p. 145). These traits raise or lower the
morph’s cost at a rate of +500 credits per CP for posi-
tive traits, or –200 credits per CP of negative traits.
Negative traits typically reflect abuses the morph has
suffered at the hands of previous occupants.

Positive morph traits                  +500 per CP
Negative morph traits                  –200 per CP


 TRADE-IN
 For those who wish to leave their old morph behind
 permanently, trade-ins on current morphs are an
 option. The high demand for bodies means that a buyer
 is almost always available unless the gamemaster finds
 extenuating circumstances. Morphs may be traded in
 for the value shown on the Morph Costs table (ad-
 justed for any positive or negative traits), less a 10%
 physical exam and finder’s fee. This is either paid to the
 morph broker in cred or rendered as a favor using rep.

  PATRON PROVISIONING
 Characters on missions for rich or influential patrons
 may have morphs provided for them. Normally
 such provisions are made for the duration of a job,
 although less commonly the morph itself might be
 payment for services rendered. Gamemasters are
 encouraged to be creative with such arrangements,
 though players should be advised that such bargains
 can quickly turn Faustian.

  BLACK MARKET MORPHS
 Black market body traders promise to provide the
 buyer with morphs and upgrades of choice regardless
 of a habitat’s laws against weapons or implants, in
 addition to bypassing standard arrival registration
 via darkcasting. Illegal morphs usually come with a
 price markup (+25% at least), whereas used morphs
 with unsavory backgrounds (and traits) can usually be
 acquired on the cheap (–25%).

  INDENTURE
 Characters who find themselves too destitute to
 afford a new morph can strike a deal for indentured
 service—a “deal” that is rarely advantageous to the

%%% txt/280.txt
   new indenture. Typical contracts require years of in-
   dentured labor—terraforming Mars, herding comets,
   asteroid mining, constructing habitats, colonizing
   exoplanets, etc.—in exchange for a cheap synthetic
   morph or splicer at the end of the term. Gamemasters
   may use their discretion in offering such terms, though
   in many cases the terms offered will temporarily or
   permanently end the character’s career as a free agent.
   Hypercorps using indentured labor are notorious for
   changing the terms at a whim, extending the service
   period, or slamming the indenture with a slew of
   hidden and outrageous charges that were not made
   clear up front. Characters may, of course, enter into
   such service fully intending to grab their morph and
   run at the first opportunity, but the hypercorps are
   very protective of their investments. Indentures are

 them, nothing “off the shelf” will do, even if it’s
customized model tricked out with specific im-
ants, traits, and biosculpting. Instead, they desire
mething unique, something that must be specially
own or designed.
 n the case of biomorphs, this can mean several
 ngs. Usually it means that the patron desires a
ry specific set of genetic traits. This could be traits
 m their original genetic lineage, traits copied from
meone they idolized or honored, genes artfully
afted by a renowned genetic designer, or mystery
 its purchased at great expense from the Factors or
tracted from a lost TITAN lab. Alternatively, it could
ean the client seeks something more specific, such
 an exact duplicate clone of their original body.
While it is possible to put an existing morph in a
 aling vat and alter its genetics with metamorph-
g nanovirii in a matter of days, these procedures
e difficult and prone to disaster. In many cases, it
preferred to simply grow the desired clone from
 atch, though even with accelerated growth this
kes from 1.5 to 2 years (or 6 months to 1 year in
e case of pods). Nevertheless, some hyperelites
 ve taken steps to ensure that the morph they
 sire is available at all likely egocast destinations.
Though rarer, custom synthmorphs are sometimes
ught after, usually by people who wish to showcase
 ique or artistic robotic designs, but sometimes also
  engineers or agents who are field-testing proto-
pes. Assuming blueprints are available, such models
n be constructed in a matter of hours or days.
Aside from time, the largest barrier to custom and
 ique morph designs is typically cost. Ultimately it is
e gamemaster’s decision on what expenses such mea-
 es entail—typically starting at Expensive and moving
 —or even whether they are possible at all.          ■
closely monitored and tracked, and the hypercorps are
not above sending ego hunters to retrieve a runaway.

PUBLIC RESLEEVING
Some locales, notably Titan, have a well-developed
public resleeving infrastructure intended to provide a
body to anyone who needs one. Morphs provided are
usually unremarkable cases, synths, or splicers with
no Positive traits or optional implants. Anyone hold-
ing citizenship in a locale with public resleeving may
apply for a body. Wait times are between a month and
two years, with Reputation influencing wait times at
the gamemaster’s discretion.

RENTING MORPHS
For temporary visits where an infomorph won’t do,
morphs may be leased rather than bought. The cost
to rent a morph is 1% of its cost per day, plus a Low
charge for resleeving. This cost includes rental insur-
ance (see below). If the rental insurance is waived
(not always possible unless you have a good Rep), the
rental cost may be reduced by half.
  Characters who are leasing a morph may also use
their previous morph as collateral. In this case, deduct
the cost of the character’s current morph from the
rental morph before calculating the 1% cost per day,
with a minimal rental cost of 10 credits per day.

PENAL LEASE
Characters visiting the inner system or Jovian
Republic may be able to lease morphs belonging
to prisoners. In most jurisdictions, criminals are
sentenced to terms in rehabilitative simulspace with
a stipulation that the prisoner’s morph becomes
state property during their term of incarceration.
Morphs acquired this way often have complicated
histories but also tend to have modifications useful
to Firewall agents. Conversely, characters who find
themselves imprisoned may be subject to having
their body leased out during incarceration.
  The effects of taking a penal lease are at the dis-
cretion of the gamemaster. A character may have
to pull some strings with their Reputation in order
to lease such a morph, especially if it has restricted
or illegal modifi cations. Negative traits, cases of
mistaken identity, and unfortunate encounters with
friends and associates of the morph’s former oc-
cupant are among the possible drawbacks to this
type of arrangement. On the up side, penal leases
may reduce costs for both leasing and insuring the
morph, again subject to the gamemaster’s discretion.

RENTAL INSURANCE
Leased morphs must be covered by an insurance
policy, which often restricts the character from
breaking the law or taking the morph anywhere
too dangerous or lawless. Characters may purchase
hazard insurance that will cover taking the morph
into certain dangerous situations, but this will
double the rental price at minimum.

%%% txt/281.txt
   If a character suffers extensive organic damage or
death while insured, the insurance will cover 80%
of the morph’s cost, meaning that the character is
expected to pay the other 20%. If they cannot pay,
their possessions or their stored morph may be
seized in payment.
   If a character violates their insurance policy by
intentionally putting themself in harm’s way above
the threat level at which the policy was purchased,
without first communicating with and rendering pay-
ment to the insurer, the policy may be declared void.
If the leased morph dies under a voided policy and
the character cannot pay to replace it, their posses-
sions and stored morph may be subject to seizure.
   Seizure takes different forms depending upon the
local economy and legal system. In hypercorp space,
it is a straightforward seizure of liquid assets, in-
cluding forced uploading if the character’s morph is
seized. Elsewhere, the character is more likely to end
up owing a lot of favors or taking severe hits to their
reputation, but they are unlikely to undergo forced
uploading or outright physical seizure of their morph.



IDENTITY
Given the nature of resleeving technologies, identity
is a fluid concept in Eclipse Phase. Transhumans are
used to the idea of identifying people by how they
look or even by their biometric data, but this is no
longer a certified method. What you look like may
drastically change from one day to the next. You
may see an olympian you recognize, but perhaps it’s
been awhile, so you’re no longer certain that it’s the
same person still in that morph. If you’re sleeved in a
popular off-the-rack morph, there may be hundreds
of other cloned morphs that look exactly like you out
there—perhaps useful if you desire to blend in. Simi-
larly, security services can no longer rely on biometric
technologies. Forensics may be able to identify an indi-
vidual morph’s presence at a crime scene, but proving
who was in that morph at the time is another matter.
   Identity is, of course, tied to ego, and various
authorities have instituted verification and security
measures based on this. Within the inner system, each
ego is given an ID number, which is used to validate
their identity, citizenship, legal status, credit accounts,
licensing, etc. This ego ID is verifiable by the person’s
brainwave patterns, which remain the same even
when resleeving. When an ego uploads, the upload-
ing service is required to incorporate this ego ID into
the person’s backup/infomorph. Likewise, when that
person resleeves, the service handling the procedure
is required by law to verify the ego’s ID before down-
loading. The ego ID is then hardcoded into the morph
itself in the form of a nanotattoo on the tip of the per-
son’s index finger. This nanotat can be easily scanned
at security checkpoints to verify identity.
   Though efficient, this system is far from perfect. For
one, ID record-keeping is far from standardized and
varies drastically from habitat to habitat. Most do not
share records with each other unless they are part of the
same political alliance in order to protect their citizens’
privacy. For example, Lunar-Lagrange Alliance stations
do not share citizenship ID data with the Planetary
Consortium, though they do share with each other.
  On top of this, many identity records were lost
during the Fall, a situation that was undoubtedly ex-
ploited by those who preferred to erase their past or
adopt a new persona. These all make for a situation
where identity records are patchwork at best. Officials
must also rely on the security of other habitats for ID
verification. If a person egocasts to Nectar on Mars
from Qing Long in the Martian Trojans, and the
Nectar officials have no record of this person, they
can only trust that the Qing Long officials did their
job when verifying the subject’s ID and background.
  To make matters worse, many autonomist habitats
operate without identity checks altogether. Though
some ID measures are still used, both to prevent
reputation system gaming and to be able to identify
bodies in the case of death, these uses are significantly
more lax and few records are kept. Therefore, when
autonomists and the like egocast to habitats that re-
quire ID, they are assigned a temporary ID for the du-
ration of their stay (and sometimes any future visits).

IDENTITY VERIFICATION
There are three ways to verify someone’s identity:
nanotat scan, brainwave scan, and checking the cryp-
tographic hash on a digital mind.

NANOTAT SCANS
Special encoded nanobots are used to create a small
nanotat on a person’s index finger. These nanobots
contain encoded information that includes their name
and identity, brainwave pattern, citizenship/legal status,
credit account number, insurance information, and
licenses. Depending on the local habitat laws, it may
include other information such as criminal history,
travel history, restricted implants, employment records,
and so on. This nanotat may be read by anyone with
a special ID scanner that reads the nanobot encoding.
   ID nanotats include information on the company
that did the resleeving, so that the data may be ac-
cessed and verified with their records online. The data
on the nanotat is also cryptographically signed with
the company’s public key, meaning that anyone who
checks the data and the signature online can tell if the
data has been altered.

BRAINWAVE SCANS
Brainwave scans are one of the few types of biometric
prints that stay with an ego no matter what morph it
is in. They are impractical for most security purposes
as they require a scan with a combination electroen-
cephalogram and neuroimaging device, referred to as
a brainprint scanner, which takes approximately 5
minutes. This device measures the subject’s baseline
brainwave pattern as well as the subject’s brainwave
signature responses when they think certain thoughts

%%% txt/282.txt
or sense certain patterns. These scans are all but
impossible to fool, however, barring hacking of the
brainprint scanner itself, and so are considered quite
reliable. For this reason they are occasionally used in
high-security facilities.
   It is worth noting that infection by some variants
of the Exsurgent virus, notably the Watts-Macleod
strain (p. 367), sometimes alters a person’s brainwave
patterns, but not in every case.

DIGITAL CODE
Digital ID codes are often incorporated into backups and
infomorphs. Not only does this help identify who the
backup belongs to, but it serves as an electronic signature
for verifying ID when the backup is to be resleeved. This
digital code typically contains the same information as
the nanotat ID, and is signed with a cryptographic hash
that makes it difficult to forge and which can be verified
online. AIs and AGIs also feature such built-in codes.

CIRCUMVENTING ID CHECKS
Firewall sentinels and clandestine agents often have a
need to hide or alter their identities. While ID system
are challenging, they are not insurmountable.

FAKE IDS
The easiest way to bypass security checks is to establish
a fake ID. Given the patchwork nature of identity re-
cords and the lack of any centralized authority, this is
not very difficult. Numerous crime syndicates and even
some autonomist groups maintain a thriving ID fabrica-
tion business, often with complete histories and medical
covers for implants that might be restricted or illegal.
   These IDs are usually registered with habitats that are
either known criminal havens, have autonomist sym-
pathies, or are isolated and remote. Though the ID is
actually verifiable and registered with these stations, the
potential shady origins of such IDs is known to most
inner system authorities and so the character may be
exposed to extra scrutiny or monitoring. Fake IDs may
be acquired that are registered with more respected au-
thorities, but this often requires a much higher expense
or connections to hypercorp clandestine operations.
   Black market darkcast and resleeving options offer
fake IDs as a matter of course.

ALTERING NANOTAT IDS
Special nanobot treatments may be manufactured
to erase, rewrite, or replace nanotat IDs. Erasing a
nanotat is easy, but not having one is a crime and im-
mediate grounds for suspicion in many habitats. Re-
writing a nanotat is also easy, though this means that
the nanotat will fail its authorization online unless the
encryption has also been cracked (p. 253). Replacing
a nanotat ID with a fake one is just as possible, and is
part of the process of acquiring a fake ID.

DIGITAL ID TAMPERING
Digital ID codes may also be tampered with, though like
nanotat IDs this will mean that the ID fails online verifi-
cation unless the encryption is also defeated (p. 253).
LIFE IN SPACE
Transhumanity is not just a spacefaring race, it is
also largely space-dwelling. While a substantial por-
tion of transhumanity inhabits planetary bodies like
Mars, Luna, Venus, and the moons of the gas giants,
the balance live in a variety of space habitats, ranging
from the old-fashioned O’Neill cylinders of the inner
system to the Cole bubbles of the outer system.

SPACE HABITATS
Space habitats come in many sizes and configura-
tions, from survivalist outposts designed to support
ten or fewer people to miniature worlds in resource-
rich areas housing as many as ten million people. In
heavily settled regions of space, such as Martian orbit,
habitats may be integrated into local infrastructure,
relying to some extent on supply shipments from other
orbital installations.
   More commonly, especially in the outer system,
habitats are independent entities. This usually means
that in addition to the main space station, the habitat
is attended by a host of support structures, including
zero-g factories, gas and volatiles refineries, foundries,
defense satellites, and mining bases.
    Habitats—especially large ones—sometimes have
visitors, as well. Majors habitats are crossroads in
space. In addition to scheduled bulk freighter stops,
they may have hangers-on such as scum barges, pros-
pectors, or out-of-work autonomous bot swarms.
   Many habitats have some form of transportation
network. This is most common in large cylindrical
habitats with centrifugal gravity. Common solutions
for public transit include monorail trains, trams, and
dirigible skybuses. Common personal transit options
included bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, and micro-
light aircraft, with larger vehicles being uncommon
and usually reserved for official use.
   Most habitats with large interior spaces also use aug-
mented reality overlays to create consensual hallucina-
tions of a sky and clouds, to which most residents keep
their AR channels tuned. One would think that in space,
talking about the weather would have disappeared from
transhumanity’s repertoire of small talk, but the habit
persists—only the weather discussed is usually virtual (if
it’s not real “weather”—solar flare activity and the like).

CLUSTER COLONY
Clusters are the most common form of microgravity
habitat. Clusters consist of networks of spherical or
rectangular modules made of light materials and con-
nected by floatways. Typically business and residential
modules are clustered around arterial floatways and in-
frastructure modules such as farms, power, and waste
recycling. Limited artificial gravity areas may exists,
frequently parks or other public places and specialized
modules like resleeving facilities (morphs often keep
better when stored in gravity). Arterial floatways in
large clusters may have “fast lanes” where a constantly
moving conveyor of grab-loops speeds people along.

%%% txt/283.txt
   Clusters are most commonly found in volatile-rich env
like the Trojans and the ring systems of the gas giants (p
Saturn). Clusters are rare in the Jovian system because
cluster of individual modules rather than one large sta
Jupiter’s intense magnetosphere is hideously inefficient.
   Cluster colonies can have anywhere from 50 to 250,000

COLE BUBBLES
Cole bubbles (or “bubbleworlds”) are found mostly in
asteroid belt, where the large nickel-iron asteroids used t
them are abundant. Bubbleworlds are less common in t
and Greeks, where crusty ice asteroids predominate. A C
is similar in many respects to an O’Neill cylinder, but th
longitudinal windows. Sunlight instead enters through a
arrays. The bubbleworld is also constructed very differen
large solar array to heat a pocket of water inside of a met
so that the metal expands. Rotating the asteroid caus
leable material to form a cylinder, which is then capped
water drained. The inside can then be pressurized, bui
planted. Cole bubbles can also be spun for gravity, accor
whims of the inhabitants, though the gravity lowers as yo
poles of the bubble, with zero gravity at the axis of rotat
   Cole bubbles are among the largest structures transhu
created in space. The largest Cole habitat, Extropia, ha
tion of 10 million.

HAMILTON CYLINDERS
Hamilton cylinders are a new technology. There are only
operational Hamilton cylinders in the system, but the de
great promise and is likely to be widely adopted over t
period. Hamilton cylinders are grown using a comple
algorithm that orchestrates nanoscale building machi
nanobots build the habitat slowly over time, a process

   Similar to O’Neill cylinders and Cole bubbles, a Ham
der is a cylindrical habitat rotating on its long axis to pr

O’NEILL CYLINDERS
Found mostly in the orbits of Earth, Luna, Venus, and Ma
cylinders were among transhumanity’s first large space
signs. O’Neill cylinders are no longer built, having bee
by more efficient designs, but are still home to tens of
transhumans. O’Neill cylinders were constructed from me
on Luna or Mercury, Lunar volatiles (including Lunar
and asteroidal silicates.

%%% txt/284.txt
   The inside of an O’Neill cylinder has six alternating
strips of ground and window running from one cap
of the cylinder to the other. One narrow end of an
O’Neill cylinder points toward the sun. The opposite
end is the mooring point for three immense reflectors
angled to reflect sunlight into the windows. Smart
materials coating the windows and reflectors prevent
fluctuations in solar activity from delivering too much
heat. The air inside the cylinder and its metal super-
structure provide radiation shielding.
   The land in most O’Neill cylinders is one-third
agricultural (a combination of food vats and high-
yield photosynthetic crops), one-third park land, and
one-third mixed use residential and business. O’Neill
habitats have a day and night cycle regulated by the
position of the external mirrors. The business and
residential sections of the cylinder usually alternate
with the park land over two of the strips of land;
cropland usually takes up the third. Bridges cross
the windows every kilometer or so, linking the land
strips. The interior climate, the architectural style of
the structures, and the types of vegetation and fauna
present vary with the tastes of the habitats’ designers.
   Depending upon size, O’Neill cylinders can house
from 25,000 to 2 million people.

TIN CANS
Antique research stations and survivalist prospector
outposts often fit this description. Tin can habitats
are only a few notches up from the early 21st-century
International Space Station. Tin cans usually consist
of one or more modules connected to solar panels
and other utilities by an open truss. Deluxe models
feature actual floatways or crawlways between
modules, while barebones setups require a vacsuit or
vac-resistant morph to go from room to room. Food
growing capacity is severely limited and there may be
no farcasters, but fabricators are available, as well as
mooring for shuttles and perhaps prospecting craft.
  Tin cans rarely house more than 50 people.

TORUSES
Interchangeably called toruses, toroids, donuts, and
wheels, these circular space habitats were a cheap
alternative to the O’Neill cylinder used for smaller
installations. Like O’Neill cylinders, toruses are seldom
constructed anymore, but many are still encountered in
the inner system, particularly in Earth and Lunar orbit.
  A toroidal habitat looks like a donut 1 kilometer in
diameter, rotating on great spokes. There is a zero-g
spaceport at the wheel’s hub. Visitors take a lift down
one of the spokes to the level of the donut, where
rotation creates one Earth gravity.
  The plan of toroidal habitats varies greatly, as many
were designed for specific scientific or military purposes
and only later taken over as habitats by entrepreneurs
or squatters. Many have a succession of decks in the
donut. Most of those designed for long-term self-
sufficient habitation have smart material-covered glass
windows for growing plants along much of the inside
surface of the torus. Toroidal habitats equipped for
farming normally face the sun in a direction perpen-
dicular to their rotational axis, but then use a slow pro-
cessional wobble of that axis to create a day/night cycle.
  Toruses were usually built to accommodate small
crews of 500 or fewer people, though some larger
ones exist, able to house 50,000. A few rare double-
toruses also exist, like two large wheels spinning in
opposite directions, joined at the axis.

IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS
How characters gain entry to a habitat and what type
of screening they’re likely to undergo depends upon
how they arrive. Some habitats are close to other
settlements, while others are physically isolated by the
vast, empty distances of interplanetary space.
   Habitats in dense planetary systems receive most of
their visitors via conventional space travel. Immigra-
tion and customs infrastructure is geared toward re-
ceiving visitors via their spaceport, and the processing
of arrivals is in most ways analogous to a twentieth
century airport. Isolated habitats, on the other hand,
tend to receive almost all of their visitors via egocast.

PHYSICAL ARRIVALS
Arrivals by spacecraft undergo, at minimum, an ego
ID check, scans to detect pathogens, hostile nanobots,
explosives, or radiation, and an inspection of their
personal effects. Some habitats go farther, including
rigorous secondary screenings using scout nano-
swarms, scans of all electronic systems for malware,
and/or aggressive interrogation of a fork of the subject.
Even autonomist enclaves enforce automated scans for
anything that might pose a danger to the habitat or
any signs of hypercorp saboteur efforts.
   Restricted goods vary according to local legalities.
Many habitats, particularly those controlled by auton-
omist or criminal factions, allow personal weaponry
as long as its nothing you can use to blow a hole in
the structure or indiscriminately kill dozens of people.
Others, notably the Jovian Republic and hypercorp
stations, disallow lethal weapons of all kinds, except
for people who have acquired special permits and au-
thorization (sometimes available by bribing the right
people or pulling favors with rep). Nonlethal weapons
are generally allowed. Other restricted items may
include nanofabricators, nanoswarms, malware and
hacker software, drugs and narcoalgorithms, certain
types of XP recordings, covert operations tools, and
so on. Certain types of morphs may also be restricted,
such as reapers, furies, or uplifts.
   Certain habitats may insist that visitors—or at
least the ones they don’t like the looks of—submit to
specific forms of monitoring or surveillance for the
duration of their stay. This might include taggant
nanoswarms, hosting a police AI in your mesh inserts,
or even physical tailing by an armed security drone.
Other stations will require that their visitors leave a
fork as a form of collateral at the door—in case they
commit a crime, the fork can be interrogated.

%%% txt/285.txt
  Finally, though rare, some habitats go so far as to
charge all visitors an “air tax”—a fee for using the
station’s publicly available resources while they are
present. This is generally only common in isolated
habitats with strained resources, and is considered
especially obnoxious by most autonomists.
   Some syndicates run a good business in smuggling
certain goods or even people into habitats. This is gen-
erally accomplished through bribed security personnel,
but is also sometimes handled as falsified credentials
that will allow the subject to breeze past security
checks. Such services are typically quite expensive.
  For those hoping to gain quiet and unobserved
access, there is always the option of taking a space-
walk and trying to break in through an unattended
airlock. Such attempts are quite often dangerous and
futile, as most habitats have dedicated sensor and
security systems to monitor their exterior surface and
in particular any access points. Still, it is a possibility
for a resourceful team with a skilled hacker, though
armed sentry bots are a particular danger.

ELECTRONIC ARRIVALS
Arrivals by egocast are sometimes interviewed by
habitat authorities in a simulspace before resleeving.
Depending upon the habitat’s attitude toward civil
rights, this process can be relatively reasonable or
quite invasive. A minimal entry inspection includes an
ID check, a brief interview with a customs AI, and a
review of the specs of the morph into which the ar-
riving ego plans to resleeve. Habitats with draconian
immigration measures may use harsh psychosurgery
interrogation techniques on suspect infomorphs. Ego-
cast backups have little recourse to avoid this treat-
ment—station authorities can simply file them away
in cold storage if they choose—so it is wise to investi-
gate custom procedures before you send yourself over.
   Because many people, particularly autonomists and
brinkers, don’t appreciate this kind of reception, vari-
ous uploading services have stepped in to provide pre-
customs resleeving for characters traveling to habitats
with suspect screening methods. For often-exorbitant
fees, the traveler egocasts into an extraterritorial sub-
station close to their intended destination, resleeves
there, and then travels to their destination by rocket.
   Various darkcast services, normally run by estab-
lished crime syndicates, sometimes offer an alternative
method of egocasting in and possibly even resleeving.
Darkcast services are quite expensive, however, and
the character is at the mercy of the syndicate opera-
tors. In rare cases, some political factions or even hy-
percorps might operate their own darkcast systems,
which a character with good networking skills might
be able to take advantage of.

SPACE TRAVEL
In some circumstances, characters will prefer to travel
physically through space rather than egocasting. In
Eclipse Phase, spacecraft are primarily dealt with as a
setting environment rather than a vehicle/gear to use.
Spacecraft largely pilot themselves via the onboard AI.
Though characters can also take over with their Pilot:
Spacecraft skill, the situation rarely calls for it.

LOCAL TRAVEL
In densely inhabited planetary systems such as Mars
and Saturn, most travel between cities, surface stations,
and orbital habitats within 200,000 kilometers is by
small hydrogen-fueled (or sometimes methane-fueled)
rockets. This form of travel is incredibly cheap, very
fast, and avoids the occasional personality glitches
that crop up during egocasting. LOTVs (lander and
orbital transfer vehicles, p. 348) are commonly used.
Spacecraft leaving a planetary body need to be able to
generate enough thrust to escape the gravity well (see
Escaping Gravity Wells, p. 346).

DISTANCE TRAVEL
For distances of 200,000 to 1.5 million kilometers,
somewhat larger (and more expensive) fusion- and
plasma-drive craft make regular runs. Nuclear electric
ion drives were once used on some of these routes,
but the poor efficiency of these fission systems and the
need for radioactive heavy metal reaction mass means
that they are almost never used anymore. Faster anti-
matter-drive couriers are also commonly used. These
ships lack the thrust to escape from the gravity wells
of large planets or moons, so they station themselves
in orbit and use smaller ships (typically LOTVs) with
higher thrust to transport people to and from the
planetary surface.
  For distances beyond 1.5 million kilometers, almost
everyone uses egocasting

SPACE TRAVEL BASICS
Spacecraft use various types of reaction drives (see
Spacecraft Propulsion, p. 347), meaning that they burn
fuel (reaction mass) and direct the heated output in
one direction, which pushes the spacecraft in the oppo-
site direction. Travel over any major distance typically
involves a period of high-acceleration burn for several
hours at the beginning of the flight, where up to half of
the reaction mass is spent to drive up the craft’s veloc-
ity. The ship then coasts for the majority of the flight at
that speed, until it approaches its destination, where it
flips over and burns an equal amount of reaction mass
in the opposite direction to decrease velocity.
   Though some craft burn half their reaction mass
to get up to the best speed possible, this doesn’t leave
much room for additional maneuvering or emergen-
cies. Many craft therefore only burn up to a quarter
or a third of their fuel in initial accelerations, so they
have some to spare in case they need it. A few tricks
can be used to save fuel and build speed, such as sling-
shotting around the gravity wells of larger planets or
aerobraking in a planet’s upper atmosphere.
   Travel times between locations are constantly
changing as various bodies move in their orbits
around the solar system. Within a cluster or planetary
system, travel takes a matter of hours. Within the

%%% txt/286.txt
inner system, travel can take days or weeks. Travel to,
from, or within the outer system can take much longer,
and is usually a matter of several months.
  Most ships operate at zero-g, except for a few larger
craft that are able to spin habitat modules for low
gravity. Periods of high-acceleration also produce
temporary gravity in a downward direction, towards
the burn.
   Space is a valuable commodity on board spacecraft,
so room is often tight. Sleeping and personal quarters
are rarely bigger than large closets, just enough room
for a sleeping bag and personal effects. Depending
on the size of the craft, there may be a communal
recreation area. The crew tend to only be busy at the
beginning and end of a trip, when they must deal with
acceleration/deceleration and maneuvering around
other space traffic. The rest of the trip they spend
dealing with repairs or otherwise killing time, often
by accessing XP or VR simulations or playing AR
games. While spacecraft have their own local mesh
network, they are usually too far to interact with the
mesh networks of other habitats without significant
communications lag, so they must make do with
their own archive of entertainment options. Many
long-haul ships are crewed by hibernoid morphs, who
hunker down for a long nap.

SPACESHIP COMBAT
Combat in space tends to take place over long dis-
tances using massive beam weapons, railguns, and
missiles. It also tends to be nasty, brutish, and short.
Significant damage to a vessel can cause atmospheric
decompression, killing any biomorph crew who aren’t
suited up and strapped down.
  For the most part, it is recommended that space
combat be treated as a plot device, part of the back-
ground story that helps create drama and tension,
rather than an event that characters actively partici-
pate in. This is not to say the characters cannot play a
role in the combat, or that their actions will have no
effect on the outcome. They may become involved in
damage control, negotiate with hostile forces, repel
boarders, target weapons with Gunnery skill, stage a
mutiny, attempt to hack the networks of approach-
ing vessels, escape out the airlock, hide out while the
pirates sack the ship, or similar affairs. It is recom-
mended, however, that gamemasters steer clear of
space combat situations that could easily lead to the
whole team dying due to a few bad dice rolls.



NANOFABRICATION
In order to create an object in a nanofabricator
(whether a cornucopia machine, fabber, or maker; see
p. 327), three things are needed: raw materials, blue-
prints, and time.

RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials are generally easy to acquire, as most
nanofabricators are equipped with disassembler units
that will break down just about anything into its con-
stituent molecules. Feedstock may also be purchased
(at a cost of Trivial). Many habitats route their recy-
cling and waste products directly into disassemblers.

BLUEPRINTS
Most nanofabricators are pre-loaded with blueprints
for general purpose items: food, simple clothing, basic
tools, etc. Blueprints for other goods may be acquired
in several ways:

 • They may be purchased online (legally or on the
   black market).
 • They may be found for free online (see below).
 • They may be acquired with Rep, following the
   usual rules for social networking (p. 285).
 • They may stolen (usually by hacking a mesh site
   or a nanofabricator containing such plans).
 • They may be self-programmed (see below).

  Once the blueprints are acquired, they are simply
loaded into the nanofabricator.

OPEN SOURCE BLUEPRINTS
Blueprints for many goods may be found for free
online, disseminated by an active open source
software movement. The availability of such plans
typically depends on the local mesh. In autonomist
habitats, a simple Research Test is likely to turn up the
open source blueprints you need (applying modifiers
for unusual items). In more restricted habitats, open
source blueprints may be harder to find, as they will
be securely hidden from the prying eyes of the authori-
ties. In this case, the character will need to use their
Rep to gain access, bribe a local hacker group, or do
something similar.
   Note that restricted nanofabricators may not accept
open source blueprints (see Blueprint Restrictions).

BLUEPRINT RESTRICTIONS
Some nanofabricators are equipped with pre-pro-
grammed restrictions not to accept blueprints for re-
stricted items (such as weapons) or non-licensed items
(such as black market or open source blueprints).
These restrictions may be circumvented by hacking
the nanofabricator and re-programming it, following
normal hacking rules (p. 254).

PROGRAMMING BLUEPRINTS
A dedicated character may simply decide to program
their own blueprints, though this is a time-consuming
endeavor. To do so, the character must make a Pro-
gramming: Nanofabrication Test with a timeframe of
one week per cost level of the item. For example, a
Trivial cost item takes 1 week, a Low cost item takes 2
weeks, a Moderate item 3 weeks, and so on. Academ-
ics: Nanotechnology skill or a skill appropriate to the
object’s design may be used as a complementary skill
(p. 173) for this test. A fork or muse may also be as-
signed to such a programming task.

%%% txt/287.txt
TIME
Once the raw materials and blueprints are in, most n
tion is simply a matter of time. The exact timeframe t
object varies, but roughly approximates 1 hour per cost
the item (1 hour for Trivial, 2 for Low, 3 for Moderate
gamemaster may feel free to modify this period as appr
the object.

THE PROGRAMMING TEST
Nanofabrication is typically handled as a Programming
rication Test. In most cases, this can be treated as a Sim
Test (p. 118), with a failed roll simply indicating that th
some minor imperfections, or perhaps took longer to ma
   In some cases, the gamemaster may call for an actual S
meaning that failure is more of a possibility. This shou
done for items that are exotic, extremely complicated, o
the blueprints are incomplete or otherwise suspect. This t
be made if the raw materials are limited.
   The character operating the nanofabricator can make
it can be left up to the nanofabricator’s built-in AI. Mos
AIs have a Programming: Nanofabrication skill of 30 (s
Muses, p. 331).

  Money is for people who don’t know how to take

cades away from being a mature Type I Kardashev
civilization, having largely mastered the material
resources of its own solar system. A character from

of money an embarrassment.
   However, material abundance hasn’t eliminated
the value of certain goods and services. A transhu-

replace money for the exchange of goods and services,
but it does hold sway over the network of favors and
influence. Calling on contacts, getting information,
and making sure you’re in the best place to see and be
seen all involve calling on your social network.

SOCIAL NETWORKS
Social networks represent the people you know, and
the people they know, and so on. It starts with your
friends and family, spreads out to your co-workers,
neighbors, and colleagues, and expands all the way
out to your acquaintances, from the neo-hominid
waitron at your favorite cafe to the sylph you flirt
with at the club. In the always-online, fully-meshed
universe of Eclipse Phase, this goes even further,
encompassing all of the people you’ve linked to via
social mesh networks, everyone who watches your
blog/lifelog/updates, and everyone you interact with
on various mesh forums. Now add in the friend-of-a-
friend factor, and everyone has an impressive ability
to reach out to people they know, people they sort of
know, and people you don’t know but who are some-
how linked to you in one degree or another.
   Of course, social networks are not homogeneous.
Among the ever-diversifying ranks of transhumanity,
there is a tendency to coalesce around various shared
characteristics, whether those be cultural background,
personal interests, professional ties, local connections,
political affiliations, subcultural obsessions, or simply
common interest from being part of the same sub-
species clade. The social network of an info-anarchist
hacker is likely to bear little resemblance to that of
a hypercorp socialite or an isolate brinker. Neverthe-
less, social networks quite frequently overlap, often
in unexpected and interesting ways. Most people can
be considered members of several different types of
social networks. This overlap is what links disparate
groupings of transhumans together.
NETWORKING
Just being connected, of course, doesn’t mean you have
several thousand idle transhumans at your beck and
call. If you hope to gather the latest gossip, get advice
from an expert, find someone who can fix your prob-
lems, acquire a piece of gray market tech, or spread a
meme, you need to know both who to talk to in that
social network and how to go about getting what you
need, especially if you hope to keep things quiet and
not raise any flags.
   This is where your Networking: [Field] skills come
in (p. 182). Networking represents your ability to ma-
neuver through this web of personal and impersonal
connections to find who and what you need. This
could be handled by word-of-mouth, posting the right
queries in the right places on the mesh, monitoring
the right personal profiles and forums, harnessing the
power of the mob with crowdsourcing, or any number
of similar creative tactics.
   Each field you have in Networking represents a
particular network grouping, a common interest that
ties people together. Most of these fields are based
on factions (Autonomists, Hypercorp, etc.) and tie
into a special reputation network (see the Reputation
Networks table, p. 287). At the gamemaster’s discre-
tion, other groupings of people could be connected
through these skills and rep systems. For example,
artists and journalists of all stripes can fall under
the Networking: Media skill and f-rep, no matter if
they are autonomist or hypercorp. Likewise, being a
diverse group, brinkers do not universally fall into any
of the categories, and are instead spread out between
them. If the gamemaster and players agree, other
Networking fields and rep networks may be added,
representing other spheres of interest, such as AR
Games, Sports, Slash Fiction, etc.
   The exact uses for which you may exploit your social
networks are noted below. While in some cases the de-
fining element is who you know and how good you are
at reaching out to them, in others the defining element
is how known you are. You might be connected to
thousands of people, but if you don’t have clout, your
efforts to make use of these connections is limited. This
is where Reputation comes into play.

REPUTATION
Reputation is a measurement of your social currency.
In the gift economies of the outer system, social repu-
tation has effectively replaced money. Unlike credit,
however, reputation is far more stable.
   Within Eclipse Phase, reputation scores are facili-
tated by online social networks. Almost everyone is a
member of one or more of these reputation networks.
It is a trivial matter to ping the current Rep score and
history of someone you are dealing with—your muse
often does this automatically, marking an entoptic
Rep score badge on anyone with whom you interact,
updated in real time, so you will see if they suddenly
take a hit or become popular. The 7 most common
networks are noted on the Reputation Networks

%%% txt/289.txt
 table. Gamemasters and characters may decide to add
 others appropriate to their game.
   You purchase a Rep score in one or more of these
 networks during character creation. Rep scores are
 rated between 0 and 99, just like skills. These ratings
 determine your ability to acquire goods, services, and
 information and favors, as noted below. These scores
 may be raised or lowered during game play according
 to your character’s actions.

 USING NETWORKS AND REP
 In game terms, you take advantage of your connec-
 tions and personal cred every time you need a favor.
 A favor is broadly defined as anything you try to get
 via your social networks, whether that be information,
 aid, goods, and so on. Different types of favors are
 described under Favors, p. 289.

 THE NETWORKING TEST
 To pursue a favor, you start by looking around. This
 calls for a Networking Test to determine if you can
 find the person, people, or information you need.
 This represents talking to people you know, spread-
 ing the word to people they know, posting queries to
 the social network at large, digging through various
 profiles, chat rooms, etc. to find someone who might
 help you out, and so on.
    Networking Tests are subject to modifiers for the
 level of the favor (see below), the amount the char-
 acter is trying to keep quiet about the request (see
 below), and any other factors noted on the Network-
 ing Modifiers table or determined by the gamemaster.
    Networking Tests are Task Actions—it takes time
 to call in favors or track down information. The time-
 frame depends on the level of favor, as noted on the
 Favors table, p. 289.

             Paying extra                  +10 per level
  FAVOR LEVELS AND MODIFIERS
  Rep scores are broken down into five levels, reflecting
  your standing within that community. Every 20 points
  of Rep equals one level. See the Reputation Levels
  table for a breakdown.
     Likewise, favors are also broken down into five
  levels, rated from Trivial to Scarce (see Favors, p. 289,
  for specific examples). The standard level of favor
  you can expect to get from a social network is based
  on your level of Rep in that network. If you want to
  pursue a favor above your level, you can do so, but
  you will suffer a negative modifier on your Network-
  ing Test. This reflects that someone with low standing
  has a hard time getting people to go out of their way
  for them. Similarly, if you pursue a favor below your
  level, you receive a positive modifier to your Network-
  ing Test, reflecting that your prestige makes it easier to
  acquire minor things that you need. For each level the
  favor falls under or above your Rep score level, apply
  a + or –10 modifier, as appropriate.


      Jaqui’s on a scum barge and she needs to get a
      hold of a weapon fast. She has a specific weapon in
      mind, but it’s pricey—its cost is High. She decides
      her best approach is to try talking to the scum on
      the ship to try and find someone who can lend or
                                                                EXAMPLE

      Networking: Autonomist skill of 50. Acquiring a
      High cost item counts as a Level 4 High favor (see
      Acquire/Unloads Goods, p. 289). Jaqui’s @-rep
      is 53, which is only Level 3. Since the favor is one
      level higher than her rep level, she suffers a –10
      modifier on her Networking Test. Jaqui must roll a
      40 or less (50 – 10) to find a weapon supplier.

PAYING/EXCHANGING FOR FAVORS
Favors don’t necessarily come for free. Depending on
what you’re after, you may also need to exchange for it.
  In the capitalist and transitional economies of the
inner system and Jovian Junta, you may need to buy
the goods or services you are after with credit. Even in-
formation might be paid for by bribing the right person.
Once spent, that credit is gone until you earn more.
  In the anarchistic reputation economies of the outer
system, you can get what you need for free. In this
case, you are acquiring goods and services based on
the strength of your reputation.


           Jaqui rolls a 39—she makes it! After posting some
           public notices on the scum social network (she’s
           not worried about legalities or hiding what she’s
 EXAMPLE




           doing—this is a scum ship after all), she gets di-
           rected to a weapons dealer with a good rep. While
           a scum arms merchant normally sells their wares
           for credit, Jaqui is scum herself, so she’s able to use
           her scum community standing and get the weapon
           for free. This uses up a High favor, however.


THE LIMITS OF REPUTATION
Even in the gift economies, reputation only gets you so
far. There are limits to how often you can ask for help
before you start coming across as pushy or a leech. In
game terms, this is expressed as a refresh rate—the
amount of time you must wait to pass before you can
seek out a favor of that level again without seeming
demanding. Refresh rates are noted on the Favors
table (p. 289).
   If you need to seek another favor before the refresh
rate has expired, you have two choices. You can
expend a higher level favor instead, keeping in mind
that higher level favors refresh more slowly. Alterna-
tively, you can burn reputation (see below).


           Now that Jaqui’s got her weapon, she needs
           another favor—she needs to find someone who
           doesn’t want to be found. The person she’s after is
           scum, so once again she turns to the scum for help.
           The gamemaster decides that this is another Level
           4 favor (see Acquire Information, p. 291). Once
           again, with her Networking: Autonomist of 50 and
           Level 3 rep, she must roll a 40 or less. She gets a
 EXAMPLE




           21, and finds someone who has the information
           she needs.
              Jaqui now has a choice. To get this information,
           she either needs to pay the person in credits (a
           High cost) or she she needs to expend another
           Level 4 favor. She’s low on money, so she decides
           to use her rep again. Level 4 favors only refresh
           once a month, though, and Jaqui used her last one
           just a few hours ago. Her only choice is to expend
           a higher favor, so she expends a Level 5 to get the
           intel she needs.
BURNING REPUTATION
In some cases, getting what you need may be more
important than not stepping on people’s tentacles. In
situations of dire need, you can burn some of your
Rep score to get the job done, meaning that you ex-
change a loss of Rep for a shot at a favor. This reflects
that you are pushing the bounds of how far people are
willing to go for you. While you still might get what
you need, your online reputation rating takes a hit as
people flag you for being needy.
   There are two reasons to burn Rep score. The first
is to get a bonus on your Networking Test. This indi-
cates that you are pulling strings and calling in mark-
ers to get the favor you’re after. This is particularly
useful when you are trying to obtain a favor that’s of
a level higher than your Rep, but abuse it too often
and you will soon have no social standing at all. Every
point of Rep you burn gives you an equivalent posi-
tive modifier on the Networking Test, up to a maxi-
mum of +30.
   The second option is to burn Rep to seek a favor
before it has refreshed. This reflects that you are asking
for too much in a short period. The amount of Rep
you must burn in this case depends on the level of favor
you are seeking, as noted on the Favors table (p. 289).


  Jaqui’s got her weapon and her target’s where-
  abouts, but she needs one more thing: a hacker.
  She needs someone who can open some doors
  and defeat some security systems so she can get
  to the target she’s after in his hideout. Since she’s
  on a scum barge, Jaqui feels that, once again, her
  best option is to work her scum contacts. The
  gamemaster determines that this will be another
  Level 4 favor. Rolling against a target number of
                                                          EXAMPLE




  40 again, she gets a 13—her luck is holding.
     She finds a hacker, but now she needs to make
  an exchange for their services. Once again she
  decides not to spend credit and use her @-rep
  instead. Jaqui’s already used up both her Level 4
  and Level 5 @-rep favors, though, so she has no
  choice but to burn reputation. A Level 4 favor costs
  10 Rep to burn. Jaqui spends it, sending her @-rep
  from 53 to 43—she’s been pulling in a lot of big
  favors in a short amount of time, and her friends
  and acquaintances are expressing their annoyance
  by lowering her social standing.


KEEPING QUIET
The problem with using social networks for favors is
that you end up letting lots of other people know what
you’re up to. When you’re involved in a clandestine
operation, that could be exactly what you don’t want.
The only way to diminish this is to take your requests
to trusted friends and ask them to keep quiet, but this
diminishes the pool of people at your disposal.

%%% txt/291.txt
   In game terms, you can try to keep word of what
 you’re doing quiet, but this makes it harder to get
 what you need. For every negative modifier you apply
 to your Networking Test, the same negative modifier
 applies to anyone making a Networking Test to find
 out what you’re up to.


              Revisiting one of our previous examples, we go
              back to the point where Jaqui was trying to
              ascertain someone’s hideout location. Because
              the person she’s after is scum, they’re on a
              scum ship, and Jaqui is using her Networking:
              Autonomist skill to find them, there’s a good
              chance that if she starts asking around to ev-
              eryone, word might trickle back to the person
              she’s after. She doesn’t want them to know
              she’s on their tail, though, so she decides to
   EXAMPLE




              make her inquiries more discreet. She applies
              a –20 modifier to her Networking Test, which
              lowers her target number from 40 to 20. As
              noted before, she rolls a 21, which is a fail-
              ure. She spends a Moxie point to flip the roll,
              though, making it a 12—a success.
                Because Jaqui took that –20 hit, represent-
              ing the fact that she was keeping her research
              quiet, her target will suffer a –20 modifier
              when he makes his Networking Test to see if
              he gets word that someone is asking around
              about his hideout.


 FAVORS
 Creative players can undoubtedly come up with many
 uses for their social networks, but a few of the more
 common are detailed here.
   Gamemasters should use their discretion as to how
 much roleplaying interaction and Networking Tests
 are included in using a social network. For normal
 goods, straightforward information queries, or small
 favors, neither dice rolling nor roleplaying may be re-
 quired. For major requests, interactions with contacts,
 and mission assistance, dice rolls and/or roleplaying
 interaction with contacts from the social network
 should usually occur. Gamemasters may wish to keep
 track of the NPC contacts in each character’s social
 networks and make them recurring characters.

 ACQUIRE/UNLOAD GOODS
Social networks are a good way to find items that
you can’t buy legally or make at home. Depending
on who you’re getting the goods from, this will cost
you credit or require an appropriate Rep score. This
favor can also be used to sell or give away such items,
making some money or perhaps even some Rep in
the process.

 ACQUIRE SERVICES
When you lack the skills or education you need, or
you just need another set of arms, you can call out
to your social network to find someone to help you
out. If you are looking for someone with a particular
skill, the result of your successful Networking Test roll
is the skill rating of the person you find. The higher
your Networking skill, the better able you are to find
highly-skilled professionals.

   skill of 43.


 ACQUIRE INFORMATION
When you can’t find the information online or you
don’t have the time or capability to look, you can
turn to people in your social network and tap their
accumulated knowledge base.

 REPUTATION AND IDENTITY
It is important to note that reputation is closely tied
to identity. If you are undercover and using a fake ID,
you can’t really call on your Rep score without giving
yourself away. As a result, many people using false
identities end up building up a separate set of Rep
scores for their alter ego.
   Note that since many social network interactions
take place online, it is possible for someone to secretly
make use of their real identity while masquerading
as someone else, as long as they’re careful about it. If
anyone happens to be spying on their activity via the
mesh, they stand a chance of being found out.

SECURITY
Firewall sentinels make a regular habit of being in
places where they are not supposed to be and bring-
ing things with them that others would prefer they
not have. Security has a different character post-Fall
than in the 21st century. Due to hyper-abundance,
physical security measures such as locks, doors, and
walls are less important than in the past to common
citizens. People don’t worry about theft as much as
in the past because most items can be replaced by a
nanofabricator. The items that do tend to engender
this type of security are irreplaceable or rare items
such as artifacts of Earth.
   Post-Fall physical security focuses heavily on
surveillance—identifying intruders and tracking
them so that they can be interdicted by transhuman
or robotic defenders. Surveillance is more effec-
tive than in pre-Fall societies because AIs with
near-human faculties of pattern recognition and
indentured infomorphs can be employed to monitor
surveillance data.
  The emphasis on surveillance results from the ease
with which most material barriers can be breached
by high-powered hand weaponry and devices like
the covert operations tool (p. 315). However, physi-
cal barriers designed to actively resist intruders by
healing themselves or attacking tools used to damage
them are used at key points in secure installations.
Such barriers are typically very expensive and so are
used sparingly.
  Transhuman, animal, and infolife defenders are
cornerstones of most security systems. The avail-
ability of a huge pool of infomorph labor to guard
facilities means that someone is always on duty,
whether as part of the surveillance system or in a
robotic shell.

ACCESS CONTROL
The first step in any security system is simply to enact
measure to keep unwanted people out. At a basic level
this involves walls, locks, fencing, defensive landscap-
ing, security lighting, and entoptic warnings.
   Barriers of different sorts present an obstacle that
must be cut through or blown apart in order to
defeat. Barriers are treated just like other inanimate
objects for purposes of attack sand damage; see Ob-
jects and Structures, p. 202.

BUG ZAPPERS
Bug zappers create minute EMP pulses that are harm-
less to most electronic equipment and implants but
wreak havoc on nanobot swarms, microbugs, and
specks. Bug zappers are generally applied to surfaces,
and as such they only destroy floating/flying swarms
or specks if they land. In areas with heavily shielded
electronics, they may be installed to destroy targets
in an entire room. A zapper instantly destroys all
free-crawling or flying nanobots and specks in a room
when it goes off, but transhuman flesh is sufficient to
prevent it destroying medichines or other implanted
nanobots. Infiltrators trying to gather data in areas
protected by zappers generally resort to going around
them or trying to plant macroscale devices.

ELECTRONIC LOCKS
Electronic locks (e-locks) are commonly used as a
means of maintaining privacy. They are easy to defeat,
however, and so are rarely used in very secure areas.
E-locks have several advantages over old-fashioned
mechanical locks. Different users can have different
authentication methods, they can log all events (entry,
exit, failed authentications), and they can be con-
nected (usually hardwired but sometimes encrypted
wireless) to security systems for remote control and
alarm triggering.
   E-locks use one of several authentication systems,
or sometimes a combination of systems:
   Biometric: The lock scans one or more of the user’s
biometric prints. Common biometrics include DNA,
facial thermographic, fingerprint, gait, hand veins, iris,
keystroke, odor, palm, retinal, and voice prints.
   Keypad: This is an alphanumeric keypad upon
which users enter a specific code. Different users can
have different codes.
   Token: Authorized users must carry some sort of
physical token that interacts with the lock to open the
door, such as a keycard, electronic key, etc.
   Wireless Code: Users must emit a cryptographic
code via near-proximity wireless signal.
   Though various technologies exist to defeat each
of these systems, there are three methods that work
against almost all e-locks. The first is use of a covert
operations tool (p. 315), which infiltrates a lock with
nanobots that swarm in and engage the electronic
mechanism. The drawback to using a COT is that its
use is immediately logged by the e-lock and an alarm
is triggered. Some e-locks are equipped with guardian
nanoswarms (p. 329) to defeat COTs, but the COT
nanobots usually manage to open the lock before the
guardians eat them.
   The second method is to hack the e-lock. Most
e-locks are slaved to a security system, so this often
means intruding into the security system and then
opening the lock from within. This can be difficult,
however, especially if the security system is wire-
lessly isolated or hardwired. The advantage is that,
if done right, all evidence of the lock being opened
can be erased.
   The third method is to physically open and ma-
nipulate the lock. This requires first opening the
lock’s case and then triggering the lock mechanism
to open the door. Both of these are handled as
separate Hardware: Electronics Task Actions with
a timeframe of 1 minute each. In addition, most e-
locks have anti-tamper circuits that will set off an
alarm if the attacker does not achieve an Excellent
Success when opening the case.

LOCKBOTS
The 21st century saw a move from mechanical
locks to e-locks and other largely electronic locking
mechanisms. These devices worked well for about
50 years, until electronic infi ltration capabilities
rendered them largely useless. The more recent de-
velopment of lockbots has more in common with
their early mechanical forebears. They are unique,
expensive, artisan items.
   A typical lockbot is heavily integrated with the
portal and barrier it protects. Lockbots usually
include an AI or indentured infomorph, self-healing
materials (treat as a self-healing barrier), and a
swarm of guardian nanobots (p. 329). A lockbot
monitors its surroundings and has visual recogni-
tion software that knows what its users and its keys
look like (Perception skill 40). Picking a lockbot is
thus incredibly difficult, because it will shut its ori-
fice and not accept a key that doesn’t look right or
that comes from an unrecognized user. Unfamiliar
nanobots trying to enter the orifice are targeted and
destroyed by the guardian nanobots. Finally, exter-
nal tools used to harm the portal or the lock will be
attacked by fractal appendages extruded from the
portal surface or the lock itself. These appendages
have a range of 1 meter, attack with skill of 40, and
inflict 1d10 +2 DV.
   Lockbots are generally immune to being hacked
because, for security, they aren’t connected to
the mesh. If attacked, however, lockbots are pro-
grammed to send out an alarm signal via the mesh.
   There are several ways to defeat a lockbot. One
is to get a copy or image of the key and then forge
a copy (using nanofabrication). Another is to attack
the lockbot or the portal it guards with so much
force that the lockbot is unable to repair it (usually
using ranged weapons, as anything within a meter
of a lockbot may be counterattacked). A third is to
somehow image the cavity beyond the lockbot’s ori-
fice without the imaging device being destroyed and
to then forge the key. All of these are difficult and
time-consuming processes.
   Some lockbots have the ability to destroy what
they’re protecting. For example, lockbots are a
common protection for the physical interfaces to
hardwired networks. If the lockbot is compromised,
it may, as a last resort, destroy the interface it was
protecting.

PORTAL DENIAL SYSTEM
Installed in corridors or doorways, this is essentially
a laser trap device. When an unauthorized person
enters the portal denial system’s area, it uses lasers
to create a grid of plasma channels that are used to
deliver a powerful electric current to the target. This
system has both lethal and nonlethal settings.
  Nonlethal: 1d10 DV + shock (p. 204)
  Lethal: 2d10 +5 DV
SELF-HEALING BARRIERS
Walls and doors that are able to rapidly repair them-
selves are sometimes found in high security instal-
lations. These barriers are made of materials that
automatically expand to “heal” small holes and that
are equipped with nanosystems that slowly repair
larger amounts of damage. The best of these barriers
do no more than slow down the most determined
assailants, but in combination with surveillance sys-
tems they are a nuisance to invaders and can slow
down attempts to flee the scene.
   Self-healing barriers heal any single source of
damage that is less than 5 points of damage almost
immediately, sealing the hole in 1 Action Turn. They
will also seal the holes infl icted by a covert ops
tool (p. 315) in the same time period. Additionally,
these barriers repair larger themselves at the rate of
1d10 damage per 2 hours; once all damage is fixed
any wounds are repaired at the rate of 1 per day.
Damage of 3 wounds or more may not be repaired
by self-healing.

SLIPPERY WALLS
On planetary surfaces, high walls and fences are still
common as a first line of defense against interlop-
ers. Slippery walls are surface treated with the slip
chemical (p. 323), creating a virtually frictionless
surface that is exceptionally difficult to climb.

WIRELESS INHIBITORS
Wireless inhibitors are simple paint jobs or construc-
tion materials that block radio signals. They are
used to create a contained area in which a wireless
network may operate freely without worry that the
signals will escape out of the area, where they can
be intercepted. Wireless inhibitors allow the conve-
nience of using wireless links within a secure area
rather than the clumsier hardwired connections. If
an intruder manages to gain access inside the area,
however, they can intercept, sniff, and hack wireless
devices as normal.

DETECTION AND SURVEILLANCE
Should security measures fail to keep an intruder
out, the second step is to detect an interloper and
track their activity.

NANOTAGGING
A lot of post-Fall security centers not around keeping
people out of private spaces, but tracking them after
they come and go. What little privacy transhumans
have, they cherish. Trespassing is a worse offense
than theft in many places.
  A room protected by a taggant nanoswarm (p. 329)
usually has two or more hives, one each at floor and
ceiling level (if in gravity; on the opposite side of the
room if in microgravity) that generate and recycle
nanobots. The taggants emerge from one hive, float
through the room, and then return to the other for
recharging and reuse. A feed line usually connects the

%%% txt/295.txt
hives so that they can share materials and power.
   Anyone passing through the room is likely to be
dosed with taggant nanobots. Once they lose proxim-
ity to the rest of the hive, they hide and periodically
broadcast pulsed transmissions meant to give their po-
sition to pursuers or investigators. Some may drop off
in clusters to form a breadcrumb trail to the interloper.

SENSORS
Any of the various sensors described in the Gear
chapter (p. 294) may be deployed within a facility
to monitor and record the passage of personnel,
both authorized and not. These sensors are typically
slaved to the facility’s security network and closely
monitored by security AIs, meaning they are vulner-
able to hacking and possibly jamming. A few other
sensor types deserve mention here:
   Chemical Sniffers: The chem sniffer described on
p. 311 can also be set to detect the carbon dioxide
exhaled in transhuman breaths. This is useful for
detecting intruding biomorphs in areas that are
abandoned/off-limits.
   Electrical Sensors: Electrical sensors can be set in
portals to detect a biomorph’s electromagnetic field
in addition to the electrical fields of synthmorphs.
   Heartbeat Sensors: These sensitive sensors detect
the vibration caused by transhuman heart beats.
They can even be used to detect the heartbeats of
passengers inside a large vehicle.
   Seismic Sensors: Embedded in flooring, these sen-
sors pick up the pressure and vibration of weight
and movement.

WEAPON SCANNERS
Weapon scanners come in several varieties, includ-
ing those that look for the rare elements used in
extremely destructive weapons such as nukes, those
that attempt to locate personal weaponry, and those
that look for detection taggants.
   Rare element scanners are nearly flawless and are
ubiquitous in habitat customs and spaceports. The
only way to circumvent them is to find an alternate
route into the protected area.
   Personal weapon scanners can monitor a specific
area, such as a small room or doorway. They use
a number of sensing systems to detect and identify
weapons and other dangerous objects, including
chemical sniffers and radar/terahertz/infrared/x-ray/
ultrasound imaging. They can detect the following
items and substances:

 • Metal used in kinetic weapons, seekers, and
   flechette weapons
 • Devices with onboard hives of metallic nano-
   bots (e.g., covert operations tools, spindles)
 • Magnetic elements in plasma guns and railguns
 • Propellant from firearms ammunition and seek-
   ers (–30 to conceal)
 • Chemical fuels used in torch spray weapons
   (–30 to conceal)
 • All explosives and grenades by their chemical
   particulate emissions (–30 to conceal)
 • Poisons and bioagents in flechette weapons
 • Any weapon or device larger than palm size
   (using sound waves and shape recognition)

  Characters trying to sneak weapons and gear past
personal weapon scanners must make a Palm-
ing Test (if concealing) or an Infiltration
Test (if somehow maneuvering around
without notice). This is opposed by a
Perception Test from the character or
AI manning the sensor system.

WIRELESS SCANNING
Some high-security areas will in-
tentionally monitor for wireless
radio signals originating within
their area as a way of detect-
ing intruders by their com-
munications emissions. These
signals can even be used to
track the intruder’s location via
triangulation and other means
(see Physical Tracking, p. 251).
To bypass wireless detection sys-
tems, covert operatives can use
line-of-sight laser links (p. 313)
for communication or touch-based
skinlinks (p. 309).

ACTIVE COUNTERMEASURES
When all else fails, active counter-
measures may be deployed against
intruders. While live transhu-
man guards are sometimes
used, robotic sentries are more
common, typically AI-driven
synthmorphs such as synths,
slitheroids, arachnoids, or
reapers, with guardian angels
(p. 346) providing air support.
Occasionally AI-operated gun
emplacements—armored tur-
rets that pop out of walls and
ceilings—are also applied. In
some circumstances, these shells
are teleoperated or even jammed
by transhuman security.
   dditional countermeasures brought
to bear will depend on the facility in
question. Some sites will engage in active
jamming, to deny the intruders any com-
munication. Others will deploy hostile nano-
swarms and even chemical weapons.

 The accelerated technological levels of Eclipse Phase
 enable a number of devices for personal enhancement,
 survival, and other uses.



 EQUIPMENT RULES
 The following rules apply to all technological items in
 Eclipse Phase.

 ACQUIRING GEAR
 During character creation, players purchase gear for
 their characters using the credits they have during
 the character creation process. Once play begins,
 however, characters must obtain any equipment they
 need the usual way: by buying, borrowing, making,
 or stealing it.
    In the inner system, hypercorp, and Jovian Republic
 settlements—and other places where capitalism still
 reigns—gear acquisition is simply a matter of finding
 a seller and buying it. Each item has a listed cost, from
 Trivial to Expensive, as noted on the Gear Costs table.
 Due to local availability of resources, supply and
 demand, and legalities, these listed costs are meant
 to be approximations. When no other factors apply,
 the listed Average Cost for that category can be used.
 Otherwise the gamemaster should modify the item’s
 worth as they see fit, according to local economic fac-
 tors, while still keeping it within that cost category
 range. The Cost Modifiers table lists out some sug-
 gested changes to an item’s cost, but these are simply
 recommendations, and can be ignored or followed as
 the gamemaster deems fit. The exact local conditions
 are largely up to the gamemaster to determine, as best
 fits their game.
    In some circumstances, characters may attempt to
 haggle over gear prices. This is best handled as ro-
 leplaying, but the gamemaster may also call for an
 Opposed Persuasion Test (or possibly an Intimidation
 Test). The character who wins may increase or reduce
 the price by 10% per 10 points of MoS.
    In the outer system, anarchist, Titanian, scum, and
 other habitats that use the reputation economy, charac-
 ters must rely on their rep scores to acquire the goods
 and services they need. The mechanics for this are cov-
 ered under Reputation and Social Networks, p. 285.
    Characters are of course free to get their hands
 on equipment by any other means they devise—con
 schemes, borrowing from friends, and outright
 theft, with all of the appropriate tests and conse-
 quences. In some cases, acquiring gear may be an
 adventure unto itself.

 FABRICATING GEAR
 Thanks to nanofabrication technology, characters may
 also create their own equipment using cornucopia

                      ■GEAR■
                       GEAR■

                                                               11


  machines and similar nanofab devices (p. 327). The
  character must have the appropriate blueprints to do
  so, whether they come with the fabber, are bought
  legitimately or on the black market, acquired with rep,
  or found online. Characters may also code their own
  blueprint desires, using the Programming: Nanofab-
  rication skill.

   GEAR MODIFIERS
  In the technological future, gear is a necessity. In many
  cases, use of equipment provides no bonuses, it simply
  allows a character to perform a task they would oth-
  erwise be unable to do. For example, it is impossible
  to pick a mechanical lock without lockpick or some
  sort of tool.
     In other cases, however, gear provides a bonus to
  the task at hand. Climbing a wall may be possible
  without tools, but if you happen to have gecko gloves
  or other climbing gear, it’s going to be a lot easier. The
  specific modifier applied is usually noted in the gear
  item’s description, typically ranging from +10 to +30.

   GEAR QUALITY
  In both of the situations above, it is possible to have
  items that are of either exceptional or inferior quality,
  with corresponding positive or negative modifiers. The
  gear may be well-crafted, state-of-the-art, cutting-edge
  experimental, or simply top-of-the-line, applying an
  additional +10 to +30. Or it may be outdated, shoddy,
  or in disrepair, inflicting a –10 to –30 modifier (in
  some cases canceling out the basic gear bonus).



                       GEAR COSTS
 CATEGORY RANGE (IN CREDITS)          AVERAGE (IN CREDITS)
 Trivial        1–99                  50
 Low            100–499               250
 Moderate       500–1,499             1,000
 High           1,500–9,999           5,000
 Expensive      10,000+               20,000



                   COST MODIFIERS
 ECONOMIC FACTOR              SUGGESTED COST MODIFIER
 Item Stolen                  –50%
 Item Used                    –25%
 Item Restricted              +25%
 Item Illegal                 +50%
 Item Scarce                  +25%
 Item Extremely Rare          +50%
 Item Common                  –25%

%%% txt/299.txt
GEAR SIZES
On occasion, you’ll need to know how small or large
a certain piece of equipment is. Though this is largely
something the gamemaster can wing on the fly using
common sense, we’ve listed sizes for many gear items
that are unusual or so futuristic that the average player
may not have a feel for what dimensions the tech
likely is. These size categories are listed on the Gear
Sizes table (p. 297). These sizes should be considered
approximations, as depending on the manufacturer
and process, some items may be smaller or larger than
similar items. It is also important to keep in mind that
as technology advances, the size and components of
various equipment items shrink, so when in doubt, go
with smaller.

MASS AND ENCUMBRANCE
A character who is carrying too much gear should
be slowed down, suffering negative modifiers both
to their movement rates and their skill tests. Rather
than micromanaging the weights of individual pieces
of equipment, however, this matter is largely left to
the gamemaster’s discretion, using common sense. If a
character loads up beyond reason, apply modifiers as
seem appropriate. The gamemaster should, however,
keep in mind that many of the manufacturing mate-
rials used in Eclipse Phase allow for items that are
much lighter than current standards without any loss
of durability or function (see Future Materials, p. 298).
Likewise, characters in low or microgravity environ-
ments can carry much larger loads.

CONCEALING GEAR
Characters may attempt to conceal items on their
person, hoping at least to hide them from casual
notice if not an intensive search. To determine how

                Medium size items are cumbersome to hold
                with one hand, ranging from the size of a 2-li-
Medium          ter bottle to the size of a medium dog. They do
                not fit in pockets, but they may be concealed

effectively the character conceals the equipment, make
a Palming Test and note the MoS (the gamemaster
may wish to roll this secretly). Whenever another
character has a chance to notice the concealed item,
they must succeed in a Perception Test and achieve
a higher MoS than was scored on the Palming Test.
The gamemaster should apply modifiers to both tests
as appropriate. For example, concealing a large item
like a sword would be difficult (–30), whereas wearing
concealing clothing like a longcoat or multi-pocketed
jumpsuit would help (+20). Likewise, a character
who is not actively looking is less likely to notice the
hidden gear (–30), whereas someone who conducts a
physical search (+30) or who has enhanced vision to
pierce protective layers will fare better.

DESIGN AND FASHION
Many objects in Eclipse Phase closely resemble their
early 21st century equivalents—a bottle of soda is still
a transparent container holding a brightly colored
liquid, clothing is obviously something you wear, and
a knife still consists of a blade and a handle. The ma-
terials, processes, and mindsets that go into making
them, however, are quite different. To start, very few
items look have a uniform, mass-produced look, even
if they were. The procedures of minifacturing and
nanofabrication allow every individual item to be
manufactured with a unique (or at least different)
look. In areas with anarchist/reputation economies, in
fact, where personal possessions have very little intrin-
sic value, expression and creativity are favored and so
many items are artistically personalized (and actual
hand-crafted items are rare and prized). Likewise,
almost all equipment is designed with ergonomics
and ease-of-use prioritized, so gear with soft curves,
pleasing colors, and form-fitting shapes are common.
Many items of personal technology, such as flashlights
or small tools, are made in the form of ovoids that
fit comfortably in the user’s hand or in similar forms
that can be easily worn or attached to clothing. To
someone from the 20th century, many common
devices look like oddly colored rocks or decorative
pieces of plastic or ceramic (in fact, many such items
are referred to as “blobjects” by older transhumans).
   The materials used to create everyday items are
also advanced, ranging from aerogel and graphene
to smart materials (p. 298) and exotic metamateri-
als with unusual physical properties. In practice, this
means that most items are light, durable (with both
tensile strength and/or flexibility, as needed), water-
proof, dirt-repellent, and self-cleaning. Most gear is
also designed with zero-G or microgravity function-
ality in mind, and can easily be clipped, tethered, or
stuck to a surface with grip pads.
   Almost all gear available in Eclipse Phase is also
available in forms that are wearable/usable by up-
lifted animals and non-humanoid morphs, such
as novacrabs, slitheroids, and so on. Even if such
customized gear is not immediately available, it is

FUTURE MATERIALS
Many materials are available and commonly used in
Eclipse Phase that are rare, theorized, or unheard-
of today. The following entries note some of the
more interesting.

AEROGEL
Low-density, solid-state “Frozen smoke” is made by
carefully foaming various materials, typically glasses
or ceramics, to an ultra-low density state. Aerogel
is semi-transparent and light-weight, feels like sty-
rofoam, but acts as an incredible insulator against
heat and cold. It is commonly used in habitats.

DIAMOND
Artificial diamond is lightweight and super-strong,
has an extremely high melting point, and has near-
perfect thermal conductivity. This makes it an ideal
substance for hardening coated surfaces (armor)
and creating super-tough diamond machinery.

FULLERENES/FULLERITES
Fullerenes are molecular carbon structures (known
as buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, and graphene)
that are extremely strong (vastly stronger by weight
than steel), heat-resistant, and can be either insula-
tive or superconductive. This makes them useful in
equipment as diverse as armor, electronics, sensor
systems, or the cables of space elevators.

METALLIC FOAM
Metal foam is created by adding foaming agents
to liquid metals, resulting in extremely lightweight




usually not difficult to nanofabricate. Smart materials
(p. 298) also make interoperability between different
morphs easy.

 INTERFACE
It is not uncommon for everyday devices to have no
visible controls as they are designed to be operated via
radio broadcasts from the user’s ecto or mesh inserts.
Any items crafted for use in emergency, combat, sur-
vival, or exploration situations, however, will feature
basic physical controls, just in case. Physical interfaces
are typically controlled by touch pads that are noth-
ing more than colored spots on the device’s surface,
though some may also project a holographic interface
display. Most equipment of this sort can can also be
voice-activated and controlled.
   Almost all devices are loaded with a complete set
of help files and tutorials. Most electronics are also
mesh-capable and equipped with specialized AIs (see
Meshed Gear, next page).

METALLIC GLASS

 sordered (rather than crystalline) atomic structure

 rials are used to create invisibility cloaks (p. 316),
uperlenses, phased array optics, and impressive
 D holograms.

 EFRACTORY METALS

 g points, making them ideal for extremely hot

RANSPARENT ALUMINA

 pphire. Transparent alumina is harder than steel
nd zero-g casting techniques allow for intriguing
ansparent construction designs, so long as its poor
 nsile strength is respected.                    ■




   SMART MATERIALS
   Many common items of technology are made from
   so-called smart materials. These devices contain—or
   sometimes consist entirely of—many small nanoma-
   chines that can both move and reshape themselves
   to alter the object’s shape, color, and texture. For
   example, smart clothing can transform from a suit of
   specialized cold weather clothing suitable for the Mar-
   tian poles in winter to a fashionable suit in the latest
   style due to hundreds of thousands of tiny nanoma-
   chines in the clothing that shift and move to reshape
   the garment. Similarly, a tool made of smart materials
   can switch from a powered screwdriver to a wrench
   or a hammer, as the nanomachines move around and
   completely reshape the tool. Smart materials all con-
   tain specialized advanced nanomachine generators (p.
   328) that keep them in perfect repair as long as they
   are regularly recharged.

 MESHED GEAR
Almost all technology in Eclipse Phase is designed
to be operated via radio signals from the user’s basic
implant, although models usable by characters with-
out basic implants are also available. In addition all
devices contain a nearly microscopic computer and
radio link (known as a “voice”) that allows the user to
easily locate the object and that reports on the condi-
tion of the object or device, how to properly use and
care for it, as well as telling the user when it needs
to be repaired and how. Most are discrete and highly
useful, but cheaply made goods sometimes have overly
annoying voices.
   This means that almost all devices can be accessed
via the mesh or directly if within radio range. This
makes them vulnerable to hacking and intrusion at-
tempts (p. 254) as well as radio jamming (p. 262).
Many devices are, however, publicly accessible (see
Spimes, p. 238). Meshed gear may also be tracked
through the mesh (p. 251). For privacy and security,
these devices are often slaved to other systems (see
Slaving Devices, p. 248); devices worn/carried by

   characters are usually made part of the personal area
   network and slaved to the character’s mesh inserts/
   ecto. For more info on meshed devices, see the Mesh
   chapter, p. 234.
     Many devices come equipped with AIs, who are
   equipped with skillsofts that enable them to oper-
   ate the device on their own, as according to voiced
   instructions or commands issued through the net. AIs
   are described on p. 264 and p. 331.

   RADIO AND SENSOR RANGES
   In Eclipse Phase, almost all devices are equipped with
   small radios so that they may be meshed. Likewise,
   many pieces of gear are equipped with sensors such as
   cameras, microphones, or other detectors. The Radio
   and Sensor Ranges table notes what range these de-
   vices operate at.

   POWER
   All of the powered devices in Eclipse Phase require
   electricity to function. With rare exceptions, most of
   them rely on either solar cells or powerful batteries.
   These batteries are high-density, room-temperature

superconductors with 25 times the capacity of the
best batteries in common use in the early 21st century.
Such batteries may also be constructed so that they
are flexible, printed on devices, or woven into fabric.
They are good for 100–500 hours of use, and will alert
the user when they start running low. More power-
ful radio-isotope nuclear batteries are also available,
heavily shielded so they do not emit radiation and
good for 3 years or more of use.
   In short, power should rarely be an issue in Eclipse
Phase games, unless it happens to fit the plot. Power
failure could also result from a critical failure roll.



PERSONAL AUGMENTATION
Almost all citizens of the solar system, whether human,
AI, or uplifted animal, use various forms of biological,
cybernetic, or nanotechnological augmentation. The
following is a list of the most common types.
  Unless otherwise noted, any bonuses from personal
augmentations are both compatible and cumulative
with bonuses from other enhancements.

STANDARD AUGMENTATIONS
Most morphs produced in the solar system include the
following augmentations.

BASIC BIOMODS
Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not
allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph
does not possess these biomods in order to preserve
public health. Basic biomods consists of a series of
genetic tweaks, tailored virii, and bacteria that speed
healing, greatly increase disease resistance, and impede
aging. A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast
as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost
body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from
cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In
addition, the morph requires no more than 3-4 hours
of sleep per night, is immune to ill-effects from long-
term exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not
naturally suffer from biological problems like depres-
sion, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies.
[Moderate, but included for free in most biomorphs]

BASIC MESH INSERTS
Mesh inserts are ubiquitous among modern morphs.
This network of cybernetic brain implants is essential
equipment for anyone who wants to stay connected
and make full use of the wireless mesh. The intercon-
nected components of this system include:

 • Cranial Computer: This computer serves as the
   hub for the character’s personal area network
   and is home to their muse (p. 264). It has all of
   the functions of a smartphone and PDA, acting
   as a media player, meshbrowser, alarm clock/
   calendar, positioning and map system, address
   book, advanced calculator, file storage system,
   search engine, social networking client, messaging
   program, and note pad. It manages the user’s aug-
   mented reality input and can run any software the
   character desires (see Software, p. 331). It also
   processes XP data, allowing the user to experi-
   ence other people’s recorded memories, and also
   allowing the user to share their own XP sensory
   input with others in real-time. Facial/image rec-
   ognition and encryption software (p. 331) are
   included by default.
 • Radio Transceiver: This transceiver connects the
   user to the mesh and other characters/devices
   within range. It has an effective range of 20 kilo-
   meters in deep space or other locations far from
   radio interference and 1 kilometer in crowded
   habitats.
 • Medical Sensors: This array of implants monitors
   the user’s medical status, including heart rate,
   respiration, blood pressure, temperature, neural
   activity, and much more. A sophisticated medical
   diagnostic system interprets the data and warns
   the user of any concerns or dangers.

  Using any of these functions is as easy as thinking.
[Moderate, but included for free in most morphs]

CORTICAL STACK
A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit
protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a
grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the
brain stem and spinal cord connect. It contains a
digital backup of that character’s ego. Part nanoware,
the implant maintains a network of nanobots that
monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture,
noting any changes and updating the ego backup in
real time, right up to the moment of death. If the char-
acter dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they
may be restored from the backup (see Resleeving, p.
271). Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless
access (for security), they must be surgically removed
(see Retrieving a Cortical Stack, p. 268). Cortical
stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort
to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered
from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or man-
gled. Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from
mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure
to prevent hacking or external tampering. [Moderate,
but included for free with most morphs]

CYBERBRAIN
Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling
AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods. Modeled on
biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architec-
ture and serve as the command node and central pro-
cessing point for sensory input and decision-making.
Only one ego or AI may “inhabit” a cyberbrain at a
time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts (p. 300)
or a ghost-rider module (p. 307) must be used. Since
cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the
equivalent of mnemonic augmentation (p. 307). They
also have a built-in puppet sock (p. 307) so that they

%%% txt/303.txt
may be remote-controlled. Cyberbrains are vulnerable
to brainhacking (p. 261) and other forms of electronic
infiltration/attack. Cyberbrains come equipped with
two or more pairs of external access jacks (p. 306),
usually located at the base of the skull, which allow
for direct wired connections. [Moderate, but included
for free in all synthetic morphs and pods]

BIOWARE
Bioware augmentations can be acquired either as a
genemod when the morph is designed and grown or
as a later modification to an existing morph, either
by using nanomachines to modify the morph’s tissue
or by externally growing the organ and implanting it.
Bioware may be used to enhance biomorphs (includ-
ing pods and uplifts), but not synthmorphs.

ENHANCED SENSES
The following are a list of the most common enhanced
senses. Each is also available as a cybernetic implant,
but bioware is much more common.
   Direction Sense: The character has an innate sense
of direction and distance using advanced inertial
navigation. The character can arbitrarily define any
point as “north” and keep track of which direction
that is, as well as knowing approximately how far
they have come. Characters with this augmentation
can always retrace any route they have taken, only
experiencing difficulty with three-dimensional routes
lacking navigational markers (such as deep space or
undersea; apply a –30 modifier). Since positioning
inside habitats by anyone with basic mesh inserts is an
automatic affair, only characters venturing to remote
locations require this augmentation. [Low]
   Echolocation: The character possesses sonar similar
to that of a bat or dolphin. The character bounces
brief ultrasonic pulses off their surroundings and uses
them to form an image of these surroundings through
the pattern of reflections of these pulses received by
the character’s ears. For more details, see Using En-
hanced Senses, p. 302. This augmentation works in
both air and water and has a range of 20 meters in air
and 100 meters in water. [Low]
   Enhanced Hearing: The morph’s ears are enhanced
to hear both higher and lower frequency sounds—the
range of sounds they can hear is twice that of normal
human ears (see Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302). In
addition, their hearing is considerably more sensitive,
allowing them to hear sounds as if they were five
times closer than they are. A character with this aug-
mentation can easily overhear even a softly spoken
conversation at another table in a small restaurant.
This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all
Perception Tests involving hearing. [Low]
   Enhanced Smell: The morph’s sense of smell is
equal to that of a bloodhound. The user can iden-
tify both chemicals and individuals by smell, and can
track people and chemically reactive objects by smell
as long as the trail was made within the last several
hours and has not been obscured. The character can
also gain a general sense of the emotions and health
of any character within 5 meters (+20 to Perception or
Kinesics Tests to do so). [Low]
   Enhanced Vision: The morph’s eyes have tetrachro-
matic vision capable of exceptional color differen-
tiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic
spectrum from terahertz wave frequencies to gamma
rays, enabling them to see a total of several dozen
colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes can
perceive. In addition, these eyes have a variable focus
equivalent to 5 power magnifiers or binoculars. This
augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Percep-
tion Tests involving vision. For further applications,
see Using Enhances Senses, p. 302. [Low]

MENTAL AUGMENTATIONS
Mental augmentations are extremely common.
   Eidetic Memory: The character can remember ev-
erything that ever happened to them, in detail, with
no long term memory loss. For example, they can
recite a page they read in a book a month ago, recall
a string of 200 random characters they viewed a year
ago, or even tell you what they had for breakfast on
a particular date a decade ago. However, they can
only remember things they paid attention to. The
character will not remember the contents of a note
on someone’s desk if they merely glanced at it; they
must specifically have read it. No effort is required to
use this augmentation, the character merely needs to
attempt to remember a specific fact. [Low]
   Hyper Linguist: The morph’s brain maintains the
linguistic flexibility of a small child, allowing the
character to learn languages with great ease. This
functions as the Hyper Linguist trait, p. 146. [Low]
   Math Boost: This implants functions as the Math
Wiz trait, p. 146. [Low]
   Multiple Personalities: The character’s brain is in-
tentionally partitioned to accommodate an extra per-
sonality. This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder,
but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their
hypercomplex environments. This extra personality
can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate
character (in ego form only) made by the player, or
the downloaded fork of another character. For all in-
tents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as
a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that
both personalities are backed up in the same cortical
stack and if downloaded they must be placed in sepa-
rate morphs or in another morph with this implant.
   Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a
time. The other resides in the background, still active,
but not on a surface level. Each ego is completely
aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc. If for
some reason the subsumed personality wants to come
to the fore, but the other personality won’t relinquish
control, make an Opposed WIL x 3 Test. Each ego
has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they
track stress and trauma separately. Any psi attacks or
social/mental influences only affect the personality at
the fore.

USING ENHANCED SENSE
Personal augmentations and technological aids
have drastically increased the sensory capabilities
of most transhumans. The following notes provide
some details on what capabilities these sensory func-
tions provide. The capabilities are typically the same
whether it’s a biological sense or a technological
sensor, though tech sensors can “turn off” certain
wavelengths and sense only specific frequencies,
whereas biological senses perceive the full spectrum
with no ability to filter parts out.

SENSORY DATABASES
 Both technological sensors and enhanced biological
 senses come equipped with databases of scanned
“signatures” that make it easier to identify whatever
 the user is sensing (in the case of bioware, these da-
 tabases are stored and accessed via the character’s
 mesh inserts). For example, infrared sensors feature
 databases listing the heat signatures of different
 animals and items, making it easier to identify such
 things. In relevant situations, apply a +20 modifier
 for identifying targets sensed this way.

ACTIVE VS. PASSIVE
An active scanner must actually emit its particular
frequency and then measure the reﬂections; this
means a similar sensor can detect it and home in on
the emitting source. For example, a character with
enhanced vision can literally see the terahertz radia-
tion emitted by someone using an active terahertz
sensor, much like someone with normal vision can
see the light emitted by a ﬂashlight.
  A passive scanner simply scans frequencies that occur
naturally—there is nothing to give the sensor away.

ELECTROMAGNETIC
SPECTRUM
   For Eclipse Phase rules purposes, the EM spectrum
is broken down by wavelength and frequency into
these categories: radio, microwave, terahertz, infrared,




    Having an extra ego in your head, working in the
  background, is helpful for multitasking. The character
  receives an extra Complex Action each turn that may
  only be used for mental or mesh actions. [High]

  PHYSICAL AUGMENTATIONS
  Most physical bioware augmentations are derived
  from the capabilities of animals.
     Adrenal Boost: This adrenal gland enhancement
  supercharges the character’s adrenal response to
  situations that invoke stress, pain, or strong emotions
  (fear, anger, lust, hate). When activated, the concen-
  trated burst of norepinephrine accelerates heart rate
  and blood flow and burns carbohydrates. In game
  ible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
 Radar (Radio/Microwave): Radar sensors work by
 tively emitting radio waves and microwaves and
 easuring them as they bounce off the target. Radar
 orks best when detecting metallic objects, and is
 ss effective (–20 modifier) against biomorphs and
mall items. Resolution is not high, however, so it can
 e shapes but not colors or fine details. It can be
 ed to detect both speed and movement, can “see”
 rough walls (up to a cumulative Armor + Durabil-
    of 100), and can detect cybernetic implants or
  ncealed items. At close ranges (1-2 meters), it can
  tect pulse rate and respiration by measuring the
 otion of the chest cavity.
 Terahertz: Terahertz sensors emit t-rays, measure
 e reﬂections, and compare them to a database
   terahertz signatures that different items/materi-
 s have. The resolution is higher than radar, but
  th slightly less detail than normal vision. Similar
   radar, terahertz sensors can see through walls
  d other materials, but to a lesser extent (up to a
  mulative Armor + Durability of 50). T-rays occur
  turally, but terahertz sensors normally require an
mitter as they are absorbed by atmosphere (as well
   water and metal). In space, however, an emitter
 ould not be required. Likewise, passive terahertz
 ans within atmosphere have an effective range of
   meters. T-rays do not penetrate skin, so are inef-
 ctive for locating implants.
 Infrared: Near-infrared wavelengths are used
 r night vision, providing resolution and detail
  uivalent to regular vision under low-light condi-
ons. Mid-long infrared is excellent for detecting
  at sources (unobstructed by fog or smoke) and
 mperature differences (as small as 0.1 degree C),
  d such thermal imaging will sense the dissipat-
 g heat traces left by warm sources on colder ones,
  owing the user to see where someone was sitting,
ace fading heat footprints, or see what buttons
 ere pressed if they are quick enough. Infrared




   terms, this allows the character to ignore the –10
   modifier from 1 wound and temporarily increases
   REF by +10 (also boosting REF-linked skills and
   Initiative). These modifiers apply until the character
   has calmed down (if the character also has endocrine
   control, p. 304, then adrenal boosts can be activated
   and deactivated at will, and the negated wounds are
   cumulative). [High]
      Bioweave Armor (Light): Bioweave armor involves
   lacing the morph’s skin with artificial spider silk bio-
   logical fibers. This provides an Armor rating of 2/3
   without changing the appearance, texture, or sensitiv-
   ity of the morph’s skin. This armor is cumulative with
   worn armor. [Low]

%%% txt/305.txt
  USING ENHANCED SEN
  also detects the blood ﬂow in a biomorph’s face
  which can be useful in judging emotional states
  (+20 modifier to Kinesics Tests), and can spot sub
  surface implants. Some normally white surfaces
  are reﬂective (mirrored) in infrared, potentially
  allowing an infrared viewer to see around corners
  or behind themselves. On the other hand, some
  glass is opaque to infrared light. Infrared is also
  useful for determining chemical composition
  (enabling Chemistry Tests by sight alone). Infrared
  sensory input is passive.
     Lidar (Visible Light): Similar to radar, but with
  much higher resolution, lidar actively bounces light
  from the infrared through ultraviolet spectrum off
  a target and measures the backscatter, ﬂuorescence
  and other properties. Lidar is very useful for detect-
  ing atmospheric chemical properties and weather.
  Like radar, it can be used to measure a target’s
  range and speed, or develop a three-dimensional
  image. One clever use of lidar is to precisely “map”
  the position of everything in a room (taking several
  turns of scanning) and then check that positioning
  later to see if anything has been moved.
     Ultraviolet: Some objects are ﬂuorescent in ultra
  violet light, including some animals, ﬂowers, insects
  urine, and minerals (which show up much better
  in ultraviolet than regular light). Some plants and
  animals have patterns that can only be seen in ultra-
  violet. Likewise, chemical dyes that only show up
  under ultraviolet, or that make certain substances
  (like blood) ﬂuoresce under ultraviolet light, have
  various security purposes. Some glass is opaque at
  ultraviolet wavelengths.
     X-Ray/Gamma-Ray: Backscatter imaging systems
  using X- and gamma-ray frequencies produce
  high-resolution three-dimensional images and
  are very useful for detecting concealed weapons
  and implants. Such imagers are very good at
  penetrating walls and metal (up to a cumulative
  Armor + Durability of 200, at least at levels safe




  Bioweave Armor (Heavy): Heavy bioweave armor
involves lacing the morph’s skin with a denser and
thicker network of the same fi bers. The morph’s
skin becomes thicker and somewhat less fl exible
except at the joints. The morph’s skin also has an
unusually smooth look, and a distinctively smooth
and tough-feeling texture. This provides an Armor
rating of 3/4 without decreasing the morph’s mo-
bility. The character’s sense of touch, however, is
significantly reduced (–20 modifier) except on their
hands, feet, and face. This armor is cumulative with
worn armor. [Moderate]
  Carapace Armor: Carapace armor combines
bioweave armor with hard but flexible plates of
ES (CONT.)
 o transhumans). These sensors can, of course, also
detect the presence of harmful radiation.

SOUNDWAVES
 he transmission of vibrations through a medium,
 ound is broken down into infrasound (frequen-
  ies below standard human hearing), normal
  coustic range, and ultrasound (frequencies above
 tandard human hearing). Soundwaves do not
propagate in vacuum.
   Ultrasound: Ultrasound sonar operates much
 ike radar, bouncing sound waves off a target
  nd measuring the returning echoes. Ultrasound
 maging is similarly low-resolution, showing
 hapes and movement but no colors and few
details unless measured closely (1-2 meters).
Ultrasound is good for identifying how dense a
material is, however, can detect denser materials
hidden beneath less dense ones. Many medical
devices utilize ultrasound, and ultrasound sensors
  an also detect gas leaks, frictional motor noises,
  nd similar mechanical emissions. Ultrasound sen-
 ors are typically unaffected by noise clutter from
 tandard acoustic frequencies.
   Infrasound: Infrasound travels much further
 han regular sound frequencies (hundreds of
kilometers). Mechanical machinery, seismic distur-
bances, tornados, explosions, waterfalls, and cer-
 ain weather phenomena create infrasound waves.
  arge animals such as elephants and whales use
 nfrasound to communicate via the ground over
arge distances, though infrasound data transfer is
 oo slow for complex communications.

COMBINED SENSOR YSTEMS
When used in combination, these sensor tech-
nologies can be potent. For example, the use lidar,
 hermal imaging, and radar can provide a three-
dimensional map of a building and everyone and
 verything inside.                              ■




   a chitin-ceramic hybrid material modeled on the
   microscopic structure and texture of arthropod exo-
   skeletons. This armor is obvious and has a somewhat
   crocodilian or insectoid appearance (character’s
   choice). The morph is completely hairless as well. This
   provides an Armor rating of 11/11. This armor is not
   cumulative with worn armor. [Moderate]
      Chameleon Skin: The morph’s skin is augmented
   with complex chromatophores so that it changes color
   like the skin of a chameleon or an octopus. The morph
   can match the appearance of almost any color and
   most patterns. This provides a +20 modifier to Infiltra-
   tion Tests to avoid being seen or noticed, as long as
   the character is stationary or not moving faster than a

%%% txt/306.txt
slow walk. The character must also be nude or wearing
smart clothing (p. 325) or a chameleon cloak (p. 315)
of the same color and pattern. In addition to blending
in, the character can also consciously change the color
and pattern of their skin to deliberately stand out (+20
on Perception Tests to notice) or simply to produce at-
tractive or interesting colors or patterns. [Low]
   Circadian Regulation: The morph only requires
2 hours of sleep to maintain health and function at
peak mental capacity. The character dreams con-
stantly while asleep and can both fall asleep and
wake up almost instantly. In addition, the character
can easily and with no ill-effects shift to a 2-day
cycle, where they are awake for 44 hours and sleep
for 4. [Moderate]
   Claws: The morph has retractable claws like those
of a cat. These claws do not interfere with the char-
acter’s manual dexterity and are razor sharp. How-
ever, they are relatively small and only do 1d10 + 1
+ (SOM ÷ 10) damage, with an AP of –1. As a result,
they are legal in almost all habitats and are considered
tools as much as weapons. [Low]
   Clean Metabolism: The morph’s symbiotic bacteria,
gut flora, and glands have been genetically engineered
to keep the morph “clean.” The morph also produces
smart antibiotics that prevent the growth of any
bacteria or yeasts in it or on its skin. As a result, the
morph is completely immune to infections, dental cav-
ities, and bad breath, its sweat has no scent, and the
morph’s efficient digestion produces somewhat less
solid waste and less odorous chemicals. [Moderate]
   Drug Glands: The morph has specially-tailored
glands designed to produce specific hormones or
chemicals and release them in the body. The charac-
ter has control over these glands and can release the
chemicals at will. Each type of drug gland is consid-
ered a separate enhancement. For potential drugs and
chemicals, see p. 317. [Low]
   Eelware: Derived from electric eel genetics, a char-
acter can have eelware implanted so that it connects
to a network of bioconductors in the hands and feet
(or other limbs), allowing the character to generate
stunning shocks with a touch. Eelware inflicts shock
damage (p. 204) exactly like a pair of shock gloves.
Eelware can also be used to power implants and spe-
cially designed handheld devices by touch. [Low]
   Emotional Dampers: This low-cost alternative to
endocrine control (p. 304) allows the user to vol-
untarily damp their morph’s emotional responses
and various non-verbal cues like pupil dilation, eye
movement, or vocal tone. Using this augmentation
allows the user to lie and conceal their emotions in
such as way as oo fool the keenest observer; apply a
+30 modifier to Deception and Impersonation Tests.
This modification does not affect methods of detecting
lies and emotions that involve reading the character’s
neural state, including psi-gamma sleights. However,
this augmentation damps out all emotional responses
and so causes the character to be less persuasive in re-
al-time personal interactions, imposing a –10 modifier
to other Social skill tests like Persuasion. Characters
can turn this augmentation on or off at will. [Low]
   Endocrine Control: This augmentation modifies the
morph’s endocrine system, giving the character fine
control over their hormone output. This allows the
character to completely control their appetite and
emotions and to regulate pain. They receive a +30
modifier against the effects of hunger, fear, and any
forms of emotional manipulation, such as the Drive
Emotion sleight. This augmentation also allows char-
acter to lie with perfect conviction and to completely
fool all methods of lie detection that do not rely
on the target’s neural output; apply a +20 modifier
to Deception Tests. It also allows the character to
remain awake for 48 hours without penalty, but after
this time the character begins experiencing normal

%%% txt/307.txt
fatigue. Finally, the ability to regulate pain reception
allows the character to ignore the –10 modifier from
1 wound. [High]
   Enhanced Pheromones: The morph’s biochemistry
has been altered so that it produces enhanced phero-
monal signals that subconsciously affect the behavior
of other humans in the vicinity. These pheromones
make the character more attractive and trustworthy to
the target; apply a +10 modifier to appropriate Social
skill tests, such as Persuasion. This augmentation only
affects characters who can smell the pheromones, and
it does not affect uplifts or xenomorphs. [Low]
   Enhanced Respiration: By boosting both lung ef-
ficiency and the blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity, the
character can live comfortably in both high and low
pressure environments, from 0.2 atmospheres to 5
atmospheres, with no dizziness or need for gradual
decompression. In addition, the character can hold
their breath for up to 30 minutes when performing
minimal activity or for up to 10 minutes while per-
forming highly strenuous activity. [Low]
   Gills: The morph’s lung tissue has been adapted to
function as gills, allowing the morph to breathe both
air and water, as long as the water is not toxic or too
stagnant. Characters with this augmentation breathe
in water and then expel the water through slits just
underneath their lowest pair of ribs that seal when the
character is not underwater. [Low]
   Grip Pads: The morph possesses specialized pads
on its palms, lower arms, shins, and the bottoms of
its feet. Designed to emulate the pads on gecko feet,
characters can support themselves on a wall or ceiling
by placing any two of these pads against any surface
not made from a material specially designed to resist
this augmentation. Characters can climb any surface
and move easily across ceilings that can support their
weight. Apply a +30 modifier to Climbing Tests. The
pads must be free to touch the surface the character is
climbing (no gloves). The nature of these pads is obvi-
ous to anyone looking at them, but they do not impair
the character’s sense of touch or manual dexterity. If
combined with the vacuum sealing augmentation, the
character can even stick to surfaces in the vacuum of
space. [Low]
   Hibernation: The character can voluntarily reduce
the morph’s metabolism to the point that the morph
requires only 5% of the normal amount of food,
water, and air. The character appears to sink into a
deep sleep, but can maintain a dim awareness of both
touch and sound and so can be easily awakened. En-
tering or leaving this state requires 3 minutes where
the character is relatively helpless. With sufficient
air, characters can safely hibernate for up to 40 days
without food or water. [Low]
   Muscle Augmentation: The morph’s muscle mass
has been enhanced and toned and myofibers strength-
ened. Apply a +5 modifier to SOM. [High]
   Neurachem: This bioware modification enhances
the character’s chemical synapses and juices their
neurotransmitters, drastically speeding up neural
connections. Neurachem can be mentally activated or
triggered by charged emotions. Level 1 neurachem in-
creases the character’s Speed stat by +1, with no side
effect. Level 2 raises the Speed stat by +2, but each
time it is used the character suffers a nervous system
fatigue hangover for 1 hour after the boost wears off
(apply a –20 modifier to all actions). [High (Level 1),
Expensive (Level 2)]
   Poison Gland: Similar to the drug gland, this
morph has special glands that produce poisons,
like the venom glands of a snake. The morph has
poison glands in its fingers and mouth, so that it can
deliver either poison by scratching someone with a
fingernail, biting them hard enough to draw blood,
or even by sharing a beverage with someone or spit-
ting into their drink. The morph is immune to the
poisons it produces. These glands may not produce
nanotoxins. [Low]
   Prehensile Feet: The morph’s feet and leg joints are
altered so that its toes are longer and more dexter-
ous and the big toe is transformed into an opposable
thumb. Physically, the morph’s feet resemble a longer
narrower hand or a human foot with finger (and
thumb)-like toes. The character can walk normally
but must wear specially designed shoes. However, this
morph runs somewhat slower than a morph with un-
modified feet (–1 meter per Action Turn). In addition,
the morph’s hips are slightly modified to allow greater
mobility. In a properly constructed chair, or when
floating in zero-G, the character can use both their
hands and their feet to manipulate the same object.
Most morphs used by characters who live in zero-G
possess this augmentation. [Low]
   Prehensile Tail: A long (1.5 meters) prehensile tail
is added to the morph’s backside, extending out from
the tailbone. This tail is prehensile and may be used to
grab, hold, and even manipulate objects. The character
can control the tail’s movements with concentration,
but it otherwise tends to move on its own. The tail
also improves the character’s balance; apply a +10 to
any Physical skill tests where balance is a factor. [Low]
   Sex Switch: A complex suite of alterations allows
the character to switch their physical sex to male,
female, hermaphrodite, or neuter. This change is
mentally triggered but takes approximately 1 week to
complete. [Moderate]
   Skin Pocket: The morph has a pocket within its skin
layer, capable of holding and providing concealment
(+30) for small items. [Trivial]
   Temperature Tolerance: The morph’s temperature
regulation and circulation are both substantially en-
hanced allowing the character to survive in tempera-
tures as low as –30 degrees Celsius and as high as 60
degrees Celsius without discomfort or ill effects. [Low]
   Toxin Filters: The morph gains an improved liver
and kidneys and biological filters in its lungs. Charac-
ters with this augmentation are immune to all chemi-
cal and biological toxins, including everything from
recreational chemicals to nerve agents to spoiled food.
In addition, the character can safely and comfortably

SYNTHMORPHS AND
BIOWARE
Though bioware is preferred and more common,
many types of bioware can be mimicked with cy-
bernetics. This is especially useful for synthmorphs/
robots, which cannot be enhanced with bioware.
The following bioware items may be replicated as
cybernetics for synthmorphs and robots:
  • Chameleon Skin
  • Drug Glands
  • Eelware
  • Emotional Dampers
  • Enhanced Senses (All)
  • Grip Pads
  • Mental Augmentations (All)
  • Muscle Augmentation
  • Neurachem
  • Poison Glands
  • Prehensile Feet
  • Prehensile Tail                                ■



 breathe smoke and drink salt water. Unlike medich-
 ines, toxin immunity prevents the character from ex-
 periencing even brief harm or discomfort from a toxin
 (medichines merely rapidly repair damage caused by
 the toxin and then remove it from the morph). This
 augmentation provides no resistance to concentrated
 acid, nanotechnological attacks, or similar destruc-
 tive agents. Some characters with this augmentation
 learn to enjoy the taste of various chemical toxins like
 cyanide or arsenic. [Moderate]
    Vacuum Sealing: To possess this augmentation, the
 character must also possess some form of bioware
 armor or carapace armor. The morph has been spe-
 cially designed to survive the effects of vacuum. The
 character’s skin resists vacuum as well as protecting
 the wearer from temperatures from –75 to 100 C.
 In addition, the character’s mouth, nose, and other
 orifices can seal sufficiently well to resist vacuum,
 and the morph possesses a special membrane that
 extends over their eyes, allowing the character to
 see in vacuum without risking any eye damage. This
 augmentation is usually combined with either the en-
 hanced respiration or oxygen storage augmentation,
 or both together. [High]



 CYBERWARE
Very little cyberware is physically implanted. Instead,
the morph is placed in a healing vat (p. 326) and the
vat’s nanobots construct the cyberware inside the bio-
morph’s body. Cyberware is rarely used for anything
that can be accomplished using bioware.
  Synthmorphs and bots may also also use cyberware.
ENHANCED SENSES
   In addition to being able to duplicate the affects of
all bioware enhanced senses, there are a few enhanced
senses that can only be produced using cyberware.
   Anti-Glare: This visual mod eliminates penalties for
glare. [Low]
   Electrical Sense: The character can sense electric
fields. Within 5 meters, the character can instantly
tell if an electrical device is on or off and can see the
precise location of electrical wiring behind a wall or
inside a device. This sense gives the character a +10
modifier on any test involving analyzing, repairing, or
modifying electrical equipment. [Low]
   Radiation sense: The character can sense the pres-
ence and approximate source of all forms of danger-
ous radiation, including neutrons, charged particles,
and cosmic rays. [Low]
   T-Ray Emitter: Mounted under the skin of the
user’s forehead, this implant generates low-powered
beams of terahertz radiation (T-rays) that allow the
character to see using reflected T-rays. As discussed in
Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302, this implant combined
with the enhanced vision enhancement (or a terahertz
sensor) allows the user to effectively see through cloth,
plastic, wood, masonry, composites, and ceramics as
well as being able to determine the composition of
various materials. This implant allows the user to see
using reflected T-rays for 20 meters in a normal atmo-
sphere and for 100 meters in vacuum. [Low]

MENTAL AUGMENTATION
These cybernetic augmentations enhance the brain
and mental functions.
  Access Jacks: Usually located in the base of the skull
or neck, this implant is an external socket with a direct
neural interface. It allows the character to establish a
direct wired connection using a fiberoptic cable to
external devices or other characters, which can be
useful in places where wireless links are unreliable or
complete privacy is required. Two characters linked
via access jack can “speak” mind-to-mind and transfer
information between their mesh inserts and other im-
plants. All synthmorphs have these by default. [Low]
   Dead Switch: This cortical stack (p. 300) accessory is
designed to keep the stack from falling into the wrong
hands. If the morph is killed, the dead switch wipes
and melts the cortical stack completely, so that the ego
cannot be recovered. This option is generally only used
by covert operatives with recent backups. [Low]
   Emergency Farcaster: Only characters with corti-
cal stacks can possess this augmentation. The morph
has an implanted quantum farcaster (p. 314) linked
to a highly secure storage facility. The high cost of
this implant also covers the cost of this storage. Using
standard radio and quantum encryption, the farcaster
broadcasts full backups of the character’s ego (pulled
from the cortical stack) once every 48 hours. At the
gamemaster’s discretion, the backup interval may be
scheduled more or less frequently, keeping in mind
that ego broadcasts are generally limited for security

%%% txt/309.txt
purposes and because they hog bandwidth. These
broadcasts only work when the character is in radio
contact with the storage facility and is typically only
used inside a habitat to broadcast backups back to a
nearby space ship. If the radio broadcasts are blocked
or jammed, this device cannot make backups.
   In the event of a farcaster failure, this augmentation
also includes a single-use emergency neutrino broad-
caster (p. 314) as well. This broadcaster contains ap-
proximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an
orange-sized triply-redundant magnetic containment
vessel. If the character is dying or urgently wishes to
depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is
brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of
matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single
brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego’s
most recent backup. However, the heat generated by
this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it
and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it.
  This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and
the broadcast can be received as long as the neu-
trino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of
the character. Within the solar system, this implant
effectively guarantees the character’s backup. It is less
useful on exoplanets where the character is out of
neutrino range of their backup facility. The amount
of antimatter carried by this implant is sufficiently
small enough that it does not produce an explosion
and will not damage any surrounding objects. Most
habitats carefully scan all visitors to determine if they
have this implant and if the amounts of antimatter
involved are sufficiently low as not to pose a danger
to the habitat and its inhabitants, and some ban this
implant entirely. [Expensive]
   Ghostrider Module: This implant allows the
character to carry another infomorph inside their
head. This infomorph could be another muse, an AI,
a backed-up ego, or a fork. The module is linked to
the character’s mesh inserts, so the ghost-rider can
access the mesh. The character may limit the ghost-
rider’s access, or may allow them direct access to their
sensory information, thoughts, communications, and
other implants. [Low]
   Mnemonic Augmentation: A character with this
augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital
recordings of all of the sensory data they have ex-
perienced in XP format (and they may share these
recordings with others). Mnemonic augmentation
differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it
allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory
data with others. It also allows them to closely ex-
amine sensory data they did not initially look at. For
example, If the character glanced at a note but did not
read it, they can later use image enhancement soft-
ware to enhance this image and in most cases actually
read what the note said. Mnemonic augmentation
allows the character to clearly hear all background
noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the
character only initially heard a few words of. Using
mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a specific piece of
information is quite easy, but usually requires between
2 and 20 minutes of concentration. [Low]
   Multi-Tasking: Only characters with cortical stacks
can possess this augmentation. The character has an
advanced computer installed in their brain that uses
the data in the cortical stack to create several simulta-
neous short-term forks to handle various mental tasks.
By design, this computer automatically reintegrates
all of these forks into the character’s core personality
after a maximum of 4 hours, earlier if desired. This
augmentation allows the character to both plan a
speech and engage in intensive mesh-browsing while
simultaneously fighting a gun battle or running from
pursuit, since each of the forks operates independently.
However, these forks can only perform purely mental
or on-line interactions. This augmentation can pro-
duce a maximum of two forks at a time, giving the
character an extra two Complex Actions on every
Action Phase for mental or on-line actions. This im-
plant cannot be used simultaneously with any other
augmentation that allows for extra actions, or with
the mental speed augmentation (p. 308). [High]
   Puppet Sock: This implanted computer allows the
biomorph’s body (the “puppet”) to be controlled by
another character (the “puppeteer”). While active, the
puppet has no control over their body and is simply
along for the ride (at the gamemaster’s discretion,
puppets who are tormented by repeated or exten-
sive loss of control may suffer mental stress). The
puppeteer may directly “jam” the puppet or remote
control it in the same way that robots and pods are
teleoperated (p. 196). The puppeteer must either be
ghost-riding the puppet (see the Ghostrider Module, p.
307) or have a direct communications link (via mesh,
radio, laser, etc.). [Moderate]

PHYSICAL AUGMENTATIONS
This implants enhance the morph’s physical body.
  Cyberclaws: The bones on the back of the morph’s
hand are bonded to smart material claws. These claws
can extend through concealed ports in the morph’s
skin and extend 6 inches past the morph’s knuckles.
These razor-sharp weapons inflict 1d10 + 3 + (SOM
÷ 10) damage and have an AP of –2. If combined
with eelware (p. 304), they can also inflict electric
shocks. Likewise, cyberclaws can also deliver poison
or nanotoxins secreted from a poison gland (p. 305)
or implanted nanotoxins. [Low]
  Cyberlimb: In an age when arms and legs can
easily be regrown, many people consider cybernetic
prostheses to be vulgar and distasteful. The Scum
and others, however, treat them as iconic symbols
of self-expression. Standard replacement cyberlimbs
function the same as their biological equivalents,
though that particular limb receives a +3/+3 Armor
bonus when targeted specifically (this bonus does not
apply to synthmorphs). Cyberlimbs may be masked
to look real (see Synthetic Mask, p. 311), and may
also feature small compartments for hiding/storing
small objects. [Moderate]

%%% txt/310.txt
   Cyberlimb Plus: More extravagant cyberlimb
models are also available, though they require more
severe body alteration to accommodate. These limbs
apply a +5 SOM bonus per limb (maximum +10).
They may be replacement limbs or “extra” limbs an-
chored in the body’s skeletal frame. These cyberlimbs
may not be masked. [High]
   Hand Laser: The morph has a weapon-grade laser
implanted in its forearm, with a flexible waveguide
leading to a lens located between the first two knuck-
les on the morph’s dominant hand. The laser fires
from this waveguide, inflicting 2d10 damage with 0
AP. The laser is powered by a small nuclear battery
located in the morph’s torso, good for 50 shots before
it must be recharged like other beam weapon batteries
(p. 338). [Moderate]
   Hardened Skeleton: The morph’s skeleton has been
laced with strengthening materials. Apply a +5 DUR
and +5 SOM bonus. [High]
   Oxygen Reserve: The morph has a miniature
oxygen tank and rebreather installed in its torso. This
implant provides the equivalent of the life support
system in a light vacsuit (p. 333), allowing the charac-
ter to breathe comfortably for up to 3 hours. It feeds
oxygen directly to the morph’s blood stream, avoiding
problems with pressure changes. Implanted sensors
automatically cause the character to use the stored
oxygen if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmo-
sphere. Without vacuum sealing, the character can
only survive in vacuum for 5 minutes, but remains
conscious and active for the entire time, giving them
far more time to find shelter or a vacsuit than charac-
ters without this implant. For every hour the character
is in a breathable atmosphere, this implant recovers
one hour of oxygen storage. The implant can be fully
recharged within 15 minutes if the character is in a
high-pressure mostly oxygen atmosphere. [Low]
   Reflex Boosters: The morph’s spinal column and
nervous system is rewired with superconducting
materials, boosting transmission speed. This raises
the character’s REF by +10 and improves Speed by
+1. [Expensive]

NANOWARE
All augmentation nanoware is advanced nanotech-
nology (p. 328), consisting of a grape-sized nanobot
generator that produces specialized nanomachines.
Nanoware is available for synthmorphs and bots in
addition to biomorphs.
   Implanted Nanotoxins: The morph has an im-
planted nanobot hive that produces nanotoxins (p.
324). This implant is designed so that the character
can deploy these nanobots instantly via a scratch with
claws, spraying with saliva, or simply making continu-
ous bare-skin contact. Characters can choose whether
or not to deploy these nanobots. Each nanotoxin
generator only produces a single variety of nanobots,
with the most common types being ones designed to
kill or incapacitate almost any living target or ones
designed to destroy delicate machinery. Characters
are immune to their own nanotoxins. Nanotoxins
are highly restricted and many habitats will not allow
anyone with this implant on board. [Moderate]
   Medichines: This is the most common form of
nanoware. These nanobots monitor the user’s body at
a cellular level and fix any problems that arise.
   Medichines eliminate most diseases, drugs, and
toxins (but not nanodrugs or nanotoxins) before
they can do more than minor harm to the host (see
Drug Effects, p. 317). If desired, the user can tempo-
rarily override this protection to permit intoxication
or other effects, but unless the character activates a
second specially labeled override, medichines prevent
the toxins from accumulating to lethal or permanently
harmful levels. In this case, they can also be activated
at a later point to reduce a drug or toxin’s remaining
duration by half.
   Medichines allow the character to ignore the effects
of 1 wound. They also speed normal healing as noted
under Biomorph Healing, p. 208. If the user suffers
5 or more wounds at once, or more than 6 wounds
in an hour, the damage has exceeded the medichines’
ability to repair. In this case, the medichines place the
character into a medical stasis, where their mind and
body are perfectly preserved, but where the character
cannot act in any way. Under these circumstances the
medichines also send out a priority call for emergency
services via the character’s mesh inserts.
   Medichines for synthmorphs and bots consist
of nanobots that monitor and repair the shell’s
integrity and internal system functions. Note that
the synthmorph version of medichines allows the
synthmorph to self-repair in the same manner by
which a biomorph with medichines would naturally
heal (p. 208). [Low]
   Mental Speed: With this nanoware system, nano-
bots alter the character’s neural architecture and
augment the functioning of their neurons. The char-
acter can deliberately speed up their mind to think
and also receive and process sensory information far
faster than ordinary humans. Time seems to subjec-
tively slow down for the character, allowing them
to carefully plan their next action, even if they only
have a split second to do so. With this system active,
the character can discern things occurring too fast
for a normal human to perceive, such as the indi-
vidual frames of an old analog film or understanding
sounds that were accelerated to many times their
normal speed. The character can also read 10 times
faster than normal and can track the paths of bullets
and similar fast-moving objects with a successful
Perception Test.
  When using this augmentation, the character gains
two extra Complex Actions during each Action Phase
that may only be used for mental actions. The charac-
ter also receives a +30 Initiative bonus. The character
thinks at normal speed whenever this nanoware is in-
active. This nanoware is incompatible with any other
augmentation that provides any form of extra actions,
such as multi-tasking. This augmentation can be used

%%% txt/311.txt
as often as desired, but actively using it renders ordi-
nary conversation and social interactions difficult and
requires concentration to maintain. [High]
   Nanophages: These nanobots patrol the body, alert
for signs of intrusive nanodrugs or -toxins and de-
stroying them before they have more than a minor
effect. Nanophages provide automatic immunity
against nanodrugs and nanotoxins unless they are
specifically commanded to stand down by the user, via
their mesh implants. [Moderate]
   Oracles: These neural macrosensing nanobots pay
attention to the sensory input on which the charac-
ter is not focusing, alerting them about important
things they might otherwise overlook. Oracles also
act as a sort of memory buffer and search aid, ex-
tending short term memory, helping the character
recall memories and details, and crosschecking
them with other memories. Oracles negate Percep-
tion modifi ers for distraction, apply a +10 modi-
fier to Investigation Tests, and add a +30 bonus to
memory-related tests. [Moderate]
   Respirocytes: These nanobots act as highly-efficient
artificial red blood cells, increasing the ability to
transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide. This increases
the morph’s ability to hold their breath to 4 hours
and increases DUR by +5. [Moderate]
   Skillware: The morph’s brain is laced with a net-
work of artificial neurons that may be formatted with
downloaded information. This allows the user to
download skillsofts (p. 332) into their brains, gaining
the use of those programmed skills until the skillsoft
is erased or replaced. Skillware systems are only
capable of handling 100 total skill points worth of
skillsofts at a time. [High]
   Skinflex: This disguise implant allows the user to
restructure their facial features and musculature and
alter skin tone and hair color. The entire process takes
a mere 20 minutes. Skinflex adds +30 to Disguise
Tests. [Moderate]
   Skinlink: Skinlink nanobots live on the morph’s
external skin or shell, automatically swarming over
and creating a physical connection with any electron-
ics the user touches. They also take advantage of the
electrical field in a biomorph’s skin for communica-
tion. They allow the user to communicate and mesh
with any devices merely by touching them. This
is considered a wired link, and so is not subject to
wireless interception or interference. Two skinlinked
characters can also communicate and mesh simply by
touching. [Moderate]
   Wrist-Mounted Tools: The morph has a 6 centime-
ter-wide metal band containing nanobot generators
implanted around each wrist. These nanobots link to-
gether to duplicate the function of a utilitool (p. 326),
creating narrow, highly flexible arms that each ends in
a specialized tool. These nanobots can also produce
tiny fiber optics to allow the character to see through
small openings, as well as being able to create small
weapons equal to bioware claws. The fact that these
tool are mentally controlled gives the character a +20
modifier to skills involving repairing or modifying de-
vices with mechanical parts, opening locks or disarm-
ing alarm systems, or performing first aid. [Moderate]

COSMETIC MODS
In an age of universal beauty, artistic cosmetic modi-
fication of your body is commonly pursued by many
transhumans. Body mods once considered dangerous
or edgy are now safe and commonplace, especially
among factions like the anarchists, scum, or brinkers.
   Bodysculpting: If your morph’s enhanced physique
isn’t enough, you can take it further with custom
bodysculpting such as as elongated ears or fingers,
nose alteration, hair addition/removal, feathers, exotic

%%% txt/312.txt
eyes, snakeskin, endowed genitalia, and more unusual
physical alterations. [Low]
   Nanotats: Tattoos created with nanobots can
move around the body, change shape/color/bright-
ness, texture, alternate text and images, and/or even
create minor holographic effects on the skin’s sur-
face, all controllable via mesh inserts. [Low]
   Piercings: Name any part of the body and some-
one’s figured out a way to pierce it, probably mul-
tiple times. Hoops, barbells, plugs, and chains are
extremely common, often made of shapechanging
smart materials. [Trivial]
   Scarification: Given modern medical abilities, scars
of any sort are purely an affectation. [Trivial]
   Scent Alteration: Minor changes to a body’s bio-
chemistry can alter a character’s natural smell or
constantly perfume them. [Low]
   Skindyes: Dye jobs are available in all conceivable
colors and patterns. [Trivial]
   Subdermal Implants: Adding small implants under
the skin can create bumps, ridges, piercing anchors,
and similar textures and alterations. [Trivial]

ROBOTIC ENHANCEMENTS
The following modifications are only available to
synthmorphs/robots.

ARMOR
These armor modifications replace the synthmorph’s
built-in Armor rating.
   Heavy Combat Armor: The synthmorph’s frame is
loaded with armor that offers protection from heavy
weapons for serious combat operations. This modi-
fication is bulky and noticeable; the bot frame is en-
cased in a heavy-duty carapace. It increases the bot’s
built-in Armor to 16/16. The shell’s mobility systems
and power output are also enhanced to deal with the
extra load. [High]
   Industrial Armor: The shell is equipped with protec-
tion against collisions, extreme weather, industrial ac-
cidents, and similar wear-and-tear. Increase the bot’s
built-in Armor rating to 10/10. [Moderate]
   Light Combat Armor: The synthmorph’s frame is
protected by armor designed for policing and secu-
rity duties. This increases the bot’s built-in Armor to
14/12. [Moderate]

MOBILITY SYSTEMS
Shells are designed with a wide-range of propulsion
systems, and are sometimes built for a specific environ-
ment/gravity. Some synthmorphs may have multiple
mobility systems. Many such systems are retractable,
meaning they can be folded away into the shell’s frame.
  Hopper: Hoppers have two or more legs designed
to propel the morph forward or up, much like a frog
or grasshopper. [Moderate]
  Hovercraft: The shell uses an impeller to blast a
cushion of high-pressure air off the surface below,
repelling the frame off the ground (modern hovercraft
do not use rubber skirts). Most hovercraft travel a
meter or so above the ground, but can temporarily
levitate themselves higher for short periods. [Low]
   Ionic: The shell uses principles of magnetohydro-
dynamics to levitate and fly, by ionizing surrounding
air into plasma to create lift and momentum. The
shell is also spun for stability. This system does not
work in vacuum, but an underwater version uses the
same mechanics for propulsion in liquid environ-
ments. [High]
   Microlight: Popular in low-grav and microgravity
environments, microlights encompass several types
of ultralight or lighter-than-air systems, such as pow-
ered paragliders, autogyros, balloons, aerostats, and
blimps. These systems do not work in vacuum. [Low]
   Roller: Only for circular shells, this system allows
the synthmorph to roll like a ball. The shell rolls
around an interior axle, propelled by a motor-driven
pendulum. [Moderate]
   Rotorcraft: Rotating blades create lift, allowing
the shell to move and hover like a helicopter. Most
models use tilt-rotors or tilt-wings so that the rotor-
blades may be moved forward (for faster propeller-
like propulsion) and for better maneuverability in
zero-G. This system does not work in vacuum. [Low]
   Snake: Commonly used by slitheroids, these shells
use lateral undulation, flexing their body from left to
right and waving their frame forward. Such shells may
also use sidewinding or a concertina motion (straight-
ening forward, then retracting the rear) to move. They
also featured gyroscope stabilization so that they may
circle into a hoop and roll like a wheel. [Moderate]
   Submarine: Designed for undersea mobility, subma-
rine shells use propellers or pumpjets to push through
water. [Moderate]
   Tracked: Tracked shells use smart rotating treads to
work their way across surfaces that would bog down
other ground vehicles. They can prop themselves up
in order to overcome taller obstacles or to lay them-
selves down to bridge across a ditch or crevice. [Low]
   Thrust Vector: These shells use either turbofans or
turbojets to create atmospheric lift with a set of wings.
The engines may be maneuvered to point and generate
thrust in different directions for vertical takeoffs/land-
ings and better maneuverability in zero-G. [Moderate]
   Walker: Walkers use two or more limbs to walk or
crawl across a surface. Many use grip pads (p. 305) or
magnetic systems (p. 310) to stick to surfaces. [Low]
   Wheeled: Most wheeled shells feature smart
spokes that allow the wheels to conform their shape
to obstacles and even climb stairs. Some low-grav
shells feature puncture-resistant and self-repairing
compressed-gas tires. [Low]
   Winged: Primarily used by smaller shells, this system
of four independently-controlled wings allows the
shell to hover or move rapidly in any direction. [Low]

PHYSICAL MODIFICATIONS
These mods are applied to the shell’s physical frame.
  Extra Limbs: The shell is equipped with one or
more extra limbs. A character using these limbs

%%% txt/313.txt
 suffers an off-hand modifier (p. 193). These limbs
may be arms (with hand/grippers/etc.), legs, tentacle-
like, or otherwise articulated and/or prehensile. Some
 shells have rotational frames that allow them to move
limbs around their body. [Low]
    Fractal Digits: The synthmorph has “bush robot”
digits that are capable of splitting into smaller digits,
 and those smaller digits into micro digits, and so on
down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine
manipulation. Apply a +20 COO modifier where such
fine manipulation is a factor (such as detailed repair
work). The bot must have functioning nanoscopic
vision (p. 311) to get this bonus. [Moderate]
    Hidden Compartment: The shell has a concealed
 aperture for a shielded interior compartment, ideal for
 storing valuables or smuggling contraband. Apply a
–30 modifier to detect this compartment either manu-
 ally or with sensor scans. [Low]
    Magnetic System: A magnetic system allows the
 shell to cling to most ferrous materials. This enables
the character to walk in zero-G situations by magneti-
 cally adhering surfaces, hang upside down, and hold
onto devices without letting them drop or drift away.
The shell receives a +30 modifier whenever maintain-
ing a magnetic hold on something. [Low]
    Modular Design: This shell is designed to lock to-
 gether with similar modular morphs in different archi-
tectural patterns to create larger gestalt forms. When
united with other modules, the group is treated as a
 single unit/morph, with shared capabilities. If dam-
 aged and then separated, damage and wounds are dis-
tributed evenly between modules; uneven amounts are
 allocated randomly. The exact capabilities of different
 shapes depends on the composition, and is largely left
in the gamemaster’s hands. [High]
    Pneumatic Limbs: The limbs are equipped with
pneumatic cylinder systems that can generate up to
1,500 pounds of thrust. This allows the shell to push
off and make impressive jumps (a synth of human
 size/weight can leap over 2 meters up). Apply a +20 to
Freerunning Tests. A pneumatic limb used to strike an
opponent in unarmed combat inflicts an extra 1d10
damage. [Low]
    Retracting/Telescoping Limbs: The shell’s limbs can
 either be retracted completely inside it’s frame and/or
 extended for extra length (usually up to 1 or 2 meters
 extra). Telescoping limbs may give the shell a reach
 advantage in melee combat (p. 204). [Low]
    Shape Adjusting: This shell is made from smart
materials that allow it to alter its shape, altering its
height, width, circumference, and external features,
while retaining the same mass. This modification is
typically employed to reshape the morph into special
 configurations adapted to specific tasks (for example,
lengthening to crawl through a tunnel, widening its
base for stability, expanding to reach out and attach
to multiple access point simultaneously, and so on).
This mod also allows the morph to change its features
for disguise purposes; apply a +30 modifier to Dis-
 guise Tests. [High]
   Structural Enhancement: This modification bolsters
the shell’s structural integrity, boosting its ability to
take damage. Increase Durability by 10 and Wound
Threshold by 2. [Moderate]
   Swarm Composition: The shell is not a single unit
but a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic mi-
crodrones. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawl-
ing, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nano-
copter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, sensor
systems, and implants are distributed throughout the
swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into
a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of
tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or hold-
ing as a unit. Individual bugs, however, are quite ca-
pable of interfacing with electronics. Swarms cannot
carry most gear or wear armor, and may not make
strength-based SOM-linked skill tests. For combat
purposes, use the same rules as given for nanoswarms,
p. 328. Damage and wounds are reflected as dam-
aged/massacred bugs. The swarm may be “healed” by
manufacturing more bugs.[High]
   Synthetic Mask: The synthmorph is equipped
with a realistic outer casing of faux-skin and care-
fully sculpted to pass as a biomorph (perhaps even a
particular person). The morph can cry, spit, have sex,
and will even bleed if cut. Only a detailed physical
examination or a radar, teraherz, or x-ray scan will
detect the synthmorph’s true nature, and even then
such exams/scans suffer a –30 modifier. [Moderate]
   Weapon Mount: The shell carries a built-in (or built-
on) weapon. This weapon mount may be either internal
(concealed, only weapons small in relation to the shell
may fit, –30 to Perception Tests to detect) or external
(visible). It may be fixed (one direction only), swiveling
(limited field of fire), or on an articulated mount (all
directions). [Low; Moderate for concealed/articulated]

SENSORS
360° Vision: The shell’s visual sensors are situated for
a 360-degree field of vision. [Low]
   Chemical Sniffer: This sensor detects molecules in the
air and analyzes their chemical composition. It enables
Chemistry Tests to determine the presence of gases, in-
cluding toxins and other fumes. It can also detect the
presence of explosives and firearms. [Moderate]
   Lidar: This sensor emits laser light and measures
the reflections to judge range, speed, and image the
target. See Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302. [Low]
   Nanoscopic Vision: The shell’s visual sensors can
focus like a microscope, using advanced superlens
techniques to beat the optical diffraction limit and
image objects as small as a nanometer. This allows
the character to view and analyze objects as small as
blood cells and even individual nanobots. The synth-
morph must stay relatively steady to view objects at
this scale. [Moderate]
   Radar: This sensor system bounces radio or micro-
waves off targets and measures the reflected waves
to judge size, composition, and motion. See Using
Enhanced Senses, p. 302. [Low]

ARMOR
Modern personal armor systems have advanced from
the high modulus polyethylene thermoplastics and
aramid fabrics of the early 21st century. Armor in
Eclipse Phase is derived from biotech, in the form of
organoweave fibers and crystalline-grown plates, and
nanotech, in the form of shock-absorbing fullerene (p.
298) materials. Occasionally other materials are used,
such as metallic glass plates or shear-resistant fluids
that harden against impacts. Such armor protects
against (armor-piercing) bullets and kinetic impacts
as well as bladed weapons and piercing sharp objects.
They also insulate against both the explosive heating
of energy weapons and electrical shocks. While such
armor protects against bullets, the layers of mate-
rial catch the bullet and redistribute its kinetic energy
across the body, which can still result in severe blunt
force trauma.
   Rules for armor in combat can be found on p. 194.
Armored exoskeletons are listed on p. 343.
   Armor Clothing: The extra-resilient organoweave
fibers and fullerene materials that offer basic protec-
tion against kinetic and energy weapons can be woven
in with normal smart materials to create a wide range
of discreet armor clothing that provides a subtle level
of security. Such protective garments are indistin-
guishable from regular clothing and come in all styles
and designs. Armor clothing provides an Armor Value
of 3/4. [Trivial]
   Armor Vest: Armor vests provide more thorough
protection to a body’s vital areas, covering the abdo-
men and torso completely, protecting the neck with a
rigid collar, and even providing wrap-under protec-
tion for the groin. Though armor vests are not bulky,
they are obvious as armor. Armor vests may be worn
with armor clothing without penalty. Armor vests
provide an Armor Value of 6/6. [Low]
   Body Armor (Light): These high performance armor
outfits protect the wearer from head to toe. An inte-
grated armor vest is supplemented with increased pro-
tection on the limbs and joints, while still managing to
be flexible and non-restrictive. Body armor is typically
worn by security and police forces, and supplemented
with a helmet. It provides an Armor Value of 10/10.
[Low]
   Body Armor (Heavy): Similar to light body armor,
but with extra protective layers, often ergonomically
manufactured to conform to a specific character’s
body, and an environmental seal with climate control
to protect the wearer from hostile environments. It
provides an Armor Value of 13/13. [Moderate]
   Crash Suit: Designed for both industrial worksite
safety and protection from accidental zero-G collisions,
crash suits are also favored by sports enthusiasts and
explorers. The basic jumpsuit offers comfortable pro-
tection equal to that of armor clothing. When activat-
ed with an electronic signal, however, elastic polymers
within the suit stiffen and form rigid impact protection
for vital areas. Crash suits provide an Armor Value of
3/4 when inactive and 4/6 when activated. [Low]
   Helmet: This armor accessory is usually worn with
body armor or a battle suit. Light helmets are open,
whereas full helmets latch on and provide an environ-
mental seal with a 12 hour supply of air. Light helmets
provide an Armor Value bonus of +2/+2, whereas full
helmets add +3/+3. Helmets are often equipped with
an ecto (p. 325), a radio booster (p. 313), and sensors
equal to specs (see p. 325). [Trivial]
   Riot Shield: Used for mob suppression, riots shields
are light-weight, tough, and may be set to electrify on
command, stunning anyone who comes into contact
with the outer surface (treat as shock glove effects, p.
334). Riot shields provide an Armor Value bonus of
+3/+2. [Low]
   Second Skin: This lightweight bodysuit, woven
from spider silks and fullerenes, is typically worn
as an underlayer, though some athletes use it as a
uniform. It provides minimal protection, but may be
worn with other armor without penalty. It provides an
Armor Value of 1/3. [Low]
   Smart Skin: Smart skin is an advanced nano-
fluid that covers the wearer’s skin. It resembles liquid
mercury but retains the texture and flexibility of
normal skin until activated, at which point the mate-
rial becomes rigid enough to protect the wearer and

distribute the kinetic energy (though still flexible
enough at the joints not to impede movement). A spe-
cialized hive, worn by the character, replenishes the
nanobots and stores them when not in use. Deploying
the nanobots across the body takes a full Action Turn.
Smart skin has an Armor Value of 3/2, and may be
worn with other armor without penalty. [Low]
  Spray Armor: This fast armor application comes in
a spray can and disperses a smart chemical polymer
that sticks to bare flesh (but does not adhere to hair
and eyes). The polymer solidifies into a form fitting
body armor fabric when exposed to body temperature
with the look and feel of a latex suit. Spray armor
does not work on synthetic morphs or on clothing or
other armor. The color and feel of the armor can be
adjusted with electric currents and additional poly-
mers, making it popular among some socialite and
nightlife scenes. The spray-on armor does not wash
off, but degrades 1 point of armor (both energy and
kinetic) every 12 hours. It may be removed with a
special nanotech solvent. Spray armor has an Armor
Value of 2/2. [Low]

ARMOR MODS
Armor modifications add extra materials or coatings
that either enhance the armor’s resistance to certain
dangers or provide other effects. Armor mods may be
easily added or removed with the appropriate nano-
bot applicators.
   Ablative Patches: These thin and light slap-on
patches of stick to armor and are designed to absorb
heat and energy from beams and explosions, safely
vaporizing and blowing hot gas away. Ablative
patches increases the Armor Value by +4/+2, but each
hit reduces both the energy and kinetic value of the
ablative armor by 1. [Trivial]
   Chameleon Coating: This provides the armor with
the same effect as the chameleon cloak (p. 315). [Trivial]
   Fireproofing: Fireproofing includes the addition of
heat-resistant ceramic or fire-resistant layers, both
capable of withstanding extremely high temperatures.
Fireproofing increases the Armor Value by +2/+0, and
provides an additional 10 points of armor against
heat or fire specifically. [Trivial]
   Immunogenic System: The immunogenic mod
adds an active nanobot swarm, maintained by a spe-
cialized hive, that coats the outer layer of armor and
also the non-armored parts of the wearer’s morph.
It acts as an outer immune system designed to neu-
tralize toxic agents and nanotoxins with which it
comes into contact. This provides immunity to drugs,
toxins, and nanotoxins applied dermally, such as
with a slap patch or splash grenade. It has no effect
on inhaled, oral, or injected drugs (including coated
weapons). [Low]
   Lotus Coating: The armor has been impregnated
with a superhydrophic coating (contact angle of
around 170°) that repels all water-like liquids. If the
armor is splashed by liquid toxins or chemicals, the
effect is reduced since the liquids starts to roll off the
armor. Apply a +30 modifier when defending against
liquid-based attacks. [Trivial]
   Offensive Armor: When activated, the outer layer of
this armor is rigged to shock anyone or anything that
contacts it with electricity. Treat its DV and effect as a
shock baton (p. 334). [Low]
   Reactive Coating: A thick layer of advanced
nanotech is applied to the armor, protecting it with
a colony of nanobots designed to sense incoming
attacks. When an attack strikes the coating, it deto-
nates to disrupt the attack. Bursts and full autofire
are treated as a single attack. A reactive coating
increases the Armor Value by +5/+5, but each deto-
nation automatically inflicts 1 point of damage on
the wearer. Reactive armor also works against melee
attacks, but the attacker also suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 (round
up) points of damage per attack (armor protects)
from the microexplosion. Reactive coating only
works against 5 attacks, after which the specialized
nanobot hive replenishes the coating at the rate of 1
use per hour. [Moderate]
   Refractive Glazing: A combination of reflectors,
refractive metamaterials, and an energy transfer
system with heat radiators provides extra protection
against energy weapons. Increase the Armor Value
by +3/+0. [Low]
   Self-Healing: The armor is equipped with a nano-
hive that acts like repair spray (p. 333). [Moderate]
   Shock Proof: Shock proof armor is electronically
insulated to discharge and reduce the effect of shock
weapons. Apply an additional +10 modifier when resist-
ing the DV and effects of shock weapons (p. 204). [Low]
   Thermal Dampening: Thermal dampening obfus-
cates heat signatures by converting body heat into
electric energy. It makes the target more difficult to
spot with thermal sensors; apply a –30 modifier for
Perception Tests. [Moderate]

COMMUNICATIONS
The oldest and most widespread communications
technology still in regular use is radio. Every habitat
and world inhabited by transhumanity is awash in
radio traffic, with humans, machines, and uplifts all
constantly communicating with one another. The
smallest radios are no larger than a spec of dust and
have a range of no more than 20 meters, while the
largest are the size of a truck and have a range of
many thousands of miles. Radios large and small are
ubiquitous and almost all devices contain at least
short-range radios so they may interact with the
mesh. Most morphs are equipped with basic mesh
inserts (p. 300) that include an implanted radio. For
radio ranges, see p. 296.
  Fiberoptic Cable: Fiberoptic cables are used to
establish wired connections between two devices.
Given the ubiquity of radios and the tangled mess
wires cause, they are typically only used for privacy
(unlike radio communication, fiberoptic signals may
not be intercepted) or in areas with heavy radio
interference. [Trivial]

%%% txt/316.txt
   Laser/Microwave Link: These portable devices are
used to establish a tight-beam, line-of-sight commu-
nications channel with another laser or microwave
link. The range of these transceivers varies widely
with environmental factors, but approximates 50
kilometers in atmosphere and 500 kilometers in
space (though horizon limits must be kept in mind,
being 5 kilometers at ground level on Earth and less
on smaller bodies). Lasers are subject to interference
from fog, dirt, smoke, and similar visual chaff, while
microwaves may be hindered by metallic obstructions.
These links may only be intercepted by getting directly
in between the beams. Some teams carry a micro ver-
sion of this system, worn on their person, allowing
line of sight intra-team communications that cannot
be intercepted like radio. [Moderate]
   Radio Booster: This device boosts the range and
sensitivity of short-range radios, like those from im-
plants, ectos, or microbugs. The booster must be with
the shorter-ranged device’s range (or directly linked
via fiberoptic cable). It will repeat any transmissions
received from that device, but at its extended range of
25 kilometers in urban areas (250 kilometers remote
areas). Broadcasts from a radio booster are easy to
receive by anyone looking for broadcasts (see Wire-
less Scanning, p. 251), though transmissions may be
stealthed (p. 252). Boosters are commonly used by
characters traveling far from habitats or other civi-
lized regions. [Low]

NEUTRINO COMMUNICATORS
Neutrinos are particles that can pass through any
solid matter with ease and are impossible to block. As
a result, they make an ideal medium for communica-
tions. Unfortunately, they are also easy to intercept.
Even a tight beam of neutrinos sent between two lo-
cations can be intercepted simply by placing another
receiver behind the location the broadcaster is sending
to. Neutrino communicators require a large power
plant to power the high energy particle interactions
required to generate the neutrino broadcast. Neutrino
receivers are also relatively large, with the smallest
occupying 100 cubic meters. In most cases, neutrino
communicators are designed to broadcast neutrinos
in all directions, though tight-beam transmissions are
also possible. Quite often neutrino communications
take advantage of quantum farcasting for security.
   Neutrino Transceiver: This transceiver is capable of
generating and receiving neutrino signals at a range of
at least 100 astronomical units. It is large, with a size
of 8 cubic meters (in a cube 2 meters on a side), but
they can be loaded onto large vehicles. To function, it
must be connected to a large power plant, such as one
found in habitats or large spacecraft. The cost and
size of this device includes the computer necessary for
quantum farcasting. [Expensive]

QUANTUM FARCASTERS
Quantum farcasters are special computers designed to
protect a communications channel (such as fiberoptic,
radio, laser/microwave, or neutrino) with unbreak-
able encryption. To function, two or more quantum
farcaster computers must first be entangled together
(on a quantum level) in the same physical location.
The farcasters may then be separated, at which point
they may continue to exchange encrypted data via
quantum teleportation. This data exchange requires
a standard communications link (fiberoptic, radio,
laser/microwave, or neutrino), and so is limited by
the speed of light, but it is a high bandwidth form
of communications. The quantum encryption used
by these entangled farcasters is unbreakable, and any
attempted interception is immediately detected and
neutralized. A quantum farcaster may not be used to
securely communicate with any farcasters other than
the ones it is entangled with.

%%% txt/317.txt
   Because it is exceptionally safe and secure, quantum
farcasting via neutrino communications is the primary
means of both long-distance communication between
habitats and egocasting (p. 276). The neutrino signal
cannot be blocked and it can only be decrypted if a
character has access to the computer that is sending
or receiving the signal.
  Miniature Radio Farcaster: Miniature farcasters
communicate with each other using standard radio
transceivers. As noted above, they may only securely
communicate with the other farcasters with which they
are entangled. Most miniature farcasters are worn as
jewelry or fitted into clothing or other equipment. [Low]

QUANTUM ENTANGLED COMMUNICATION
The rarest form of communications is quantum en-
tangled (QE) communication. QE communication is
instantaneous and works over any distance, but is
also very limited. QE communication requires pairs
of entangled particles known as qubits. To use QE,
large number of pairs of qubits are created and then
separated from each other. Millions of these sepa-
rated pairs of particles are stored in special containers
known as qubit reservoirs. If two QE communicators
each have a qubit reservoir containing qubits that are
each entangled with qubits in the other communica-
tor’s qubit reservoir, then characters can use the two
QE communicators to commutate with one another
instantaneously. Characters can use QE to instantly
communicate between any two locations, even if one
character is in the solar system and the other has
passed through a Pandora gate and is standing on a
planet 500 light years away.
   Each bit of data transmitted between these two QE
comms uses up one qubit. Once all of the qubits are
used up, the two QE comms can no longer communi-
cate with each other until they each get a new batch
of entangled qubits. Qubits are expensive to produce,
contain, and transport, making this an exceedingly
expensive form of communication. As a result, ex-
tremely high bandwidth communications like full
sensory AR and egocasting cannot be performed using
QE communication.
   Portable QE Comm: This is a handheld FTL com-
munications device. The actual communications unit
can be made as small as desired, but must be large
enough to connect to or hold a qubit reservoir. Be-
cause qubit reservoirs are relatively large and must be
replaced, they are rarely implanted. Some miniature
farcasters are designed so that users can also attach
qubit reservoirs to enable them to be used for both
light speed and FTL communication. [Low]
   Low-Capacity Qubit Reservoir: Low-capacity qubit
reservoirs can be used for 10 hours of high-resolution
video conferencing or meshbrowsing and 100 hours
of voice or text only communications. [High]
   High-Capacity Qubit Reservoir: High-capacity qubit
reservoirs can be used for 100 hours of high-resolution
video conferencing or meshbrowsing and 1,000 hours
of voice or text only communications. [Expensive]
  BUGS AND
  SURVEILLANCE
  Though surveillance technologies are pervasive
  and easy to come by in Eclipse Phase, secretly
  obtaining information on someone who wants
  to retain privacy can be quite difficult. Micro-
  bugs, smart dust, and similar recording devices
  that are all but invisible may be exceptionally
  easy to put into place, but once they begin ac-
  tively transmitting, they are easy to to detect
  (see Wireless Scanning, p. 251). An eavesdropper
  may attempt to stealth the signal (see Stealthed
  Signals, p. 252), but this is not guaranteed to
  work. Once a signal is detected, locating the
  broadcasting device is usually just a matter of
  time (see Tracking, p. 251).
     Some recording devices attempt to avoid this
  problem by using miniature quantum farcasters
  (p. 314), but those are far larger and more dif-
  ficult to hide. Often the most effective way to
  acquire discrete information is to plant a surveil-
  lance device, set to record but not transmit, and
  then retrieve it later. While doing this is often
  difficult and risky, the recording device never
  reveals its presence by broadcasting and so is
  more difficult to detect.                        ■




COVERT AND ESPIONAGE TECHNOLOGIES
These technologies allow characters to acquire pro-
tected information and to gain access to places that
others try to keep them out of. Many of these devices
are mesh-capable and equipped with radios, see p. 296
for radio ranges.
   Chameleon Cloak: This loose, poncho-like cloak
contains a network of sensors that perceive wave-
lengths from microwave to ultra-violet. A similar net-
work of miniature emitters precisely replicate the in-
formation its sensors receive, making the wearer seem
transparent to those wavelengths. A chameleon cloak
allows a character to effectively become invisible as
long as they are stationary or not moving faster than
a slow walk. When worn by someone moving faster,
the cloak still provides a +30 modifier to Infiltration
Tests to avoid being seen or noticed.
   Chameleon cloaks are not effective against radar,
x-ray, or gamma-ray sensors. They do hide the char-
acter from thermal infrared, however, by absorbing
the character’s body heat into its heat sink. The cloak
can only absorb a character’s body heat for one hour
before it must emit this heat. Heat emission also re-
quires one hour, during which time the character is
easily visible in the thermal infrared spectrum. [Low]
   Covert Operations Tool (COT): This handheld
device is the ultimate in infiltration technology. It con-
tains both smart matter micromanipulators, cutting

%%% txt/318.txt
tools, and an advanced nanotechnology generator
capable of producing nanobots that can bore or cut
through almost any material and disable or open
almost any electronic lock.
   Cutting out a lock or boring a 1-millimeter hole in
a wall with a COT requires ((Durability + Armor) ÷
10) seconds. Cutting out a 1-meter diameter hole in
a wall requires ((Durability + Armor) ÷ 10) minutes.
These same nanobots can later be used to repair this
damage so that it is invisible to any but the most care-
ful and detailed examination.
   A COT can easily open any old-fashioned mechani-
cal lock simply by analyzing it and shaping an ap-
propriate key, though this takes a full Action Turn.
It can also open electronic locks by infiltrating them
with nanobots that influence the lock’s electronics,
no matter what authentication system the lock uses.
Opening electronic locks takes a full Action Turn, but
success is practically guaranteed. Opening an elec-
tronic lock in this manner will, however, trigger an
alarm and/or be logged as an event. For more details,
see Electronic Locks, p. 291. [High]
   Cuffband: This smart plastic loop restricts around
a prisoner’s limbs when activated. If the prisoner
struggles, it will tighten more. Cuffbands will inform
the user if they are cut or loosened and are electron-
ically-controlled, so the user can release the prisoner
remotely. Some cuffband variants including a shock
system (treat as a shock baton, p. 334) to zap and
restrain unruly prisoners. [Low]
   Dazzler: The dazzler is a tiny laser system set on
a rotating ball. When activated, it consistently spins
and emits laser pulses in all directions. These laser
pulses are not dangerous, but they detect the lenses
of camera systems (including specs, viewers, and bot/
synthmorph sensors) and repeatedly zap them with
laser pulses of varying strength to overload and dazzle
them. For as long as a dazzler is active, any camera
system (visual, infrared, and ultraviolet) within line
of sight and within 200 meters is blinded. [Moderate]
   Disabler: This handy device emits an overloading
surge that completely incapacitates and disables a
synthetic morph or pod (anything with a cyberbrain)
when it is plugged into an access jack and activated.
The affected cyberbrain will be unable to function until
the signal is deactivated, effectively shutting down the
ego (or AI). In order to plug a disabler into an unwill-
ing target, the target must first be grappled or a called
shot must be successfully made in melee combat. This
device does not work on larger synthetic morphs (like
vehicles) or on cyberbrainless robots.[High]
   Fiber Eye: This is a flexible and electronically-con-
trollable length of fiberoptic cable and viewer, which
can be worked through cracks, under doors, and
around corners to peep unobtrusively. [Low]
   Invisibility Cloak: This cloak is made of metama-
terials with a negative refractive index, so that light
actually bends around it, making it and anything it
covers invisible. This invisibility works from the
microwave to ultraviolet spectrums, but not against
radar or x-rays. The drawback is that anything con-
cealed within the cloak can’t see out. This is easily
overcome by using external sensor feeds (if available)
and entoptics to navigate. Alternately, a small piece of
anti-cloak, which cancels the cloak’s invisibility prop-
erties when touched together, can be used to create a
small window to peep out of, though this increases
the chance of being spotted. Noticing such a window
requires a Perception Test with a –30 modifier. [High]
   Microbug: This device is a tiny camera and micro-
phone 1 millimeter across. It has the visual capabili-
ties of a set of specs (p. 325). It can hear everything
within 20 meters and see everything within the same
range that is in its line of sight. A microbug can record
up to 100 hours of information. Microbugs can be
set to broadcast continuously, at set intervals, or only
when they receive a special signal. If desired, they
can also be set to only record if there is movement
or voices in the room they are in. Microbugs have
adhesive backs and can stick to almost any surface.
Microbugs can also establish their location via mesh
positioning or GPS, and so double as tracking devices.
To avoid being detected by their radio transmissions,
some microbugs are attached to miniature quantum
farcasters (p. 314). These microbugs are much larger
(1 centimeter) and easy to see, but their transmissions
cannot be detected or blocked. [Trivial, Low for quan-
tum farcaster bugs]
   Prisoner Mask: This hood tightens around the
head of a prisoner, blocks all vision frequencies, and
engages in low-level jamming in order to prevent any
wireless communication via mesh inserts. [Medium]
   Psi Jammer: This device jams frequencies used
by brainwaves within a 20-meter radius. This has
no effect on brain functions, but it does prevent
any ranged used of psi sleights within this area of
effect. [Moderate]
   Quantum Computer: These advanced devices
make use of quantum computation, allowing them
to handle extremely large numbers with ease. This
makes them especially useful for codebreaking, as
noted on p. 254. [Expensive]
   Smart Dust: This device is a walnut-sized special-
ized nanobot generator that creates tiny sensor nano-
bots, each one of which is a tiny sphere the diameter
of a human hair. A packet of smart dust nanobots is
sufficient to perform detailed surveillance on a large
room like an auditorium has a volume of 1 cubic
centimeter and contains 3 million nanobots. Each
nanobot contains tiny cameras, microphones, a tiny
computer, a radio, and chemical sensors, as well as
short legs that allow them to walk and climb at a rate
of 5 cm per second.
   When a character dumps a packet of smart dust in
a room, it will cover every surface in the room within
20 minutes, including all furniture and the insides
of every drawer and other space that is not airtight.
At this point, the smart dust has recorded all data
about the room that can be obtained by exceedingly
detailed observation, including the DNA of everyone

%%% txt/319.txt
who has visited the room in the last week or two. The
smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly
compressed signal, or it can send all of its informa-
tion to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a
pre-arranged destination for pickup and downloading
by their user. The user need only find a single nano-
bot with a nanodetector to acquire the information
obtained by the smart dust. If ordered to do so, the
remaining nanobots can either power down and await
further orders or self-destruct in a fashion that turns
them into a tiny amount of dust made mostly of metal
and silicon. [Moderate]
   Traction Pads: This set of specialized fingerless
gloves, shoes, and kneepads is designed to emulate the
pads on geckos’ feet. Characters can support them-
selves on a wall or ceiling by placing any two of these
pads against any surface not made from a material
specially designed to resist such devices. Characters
can climb any surface and move easily across walls
and ceilings that can support their weight (+30 to
Climbing Tests). In addition to climbing, these devices
are also very popular in zero-g environments. Wearing
this item does not impair the user’s agility or manual
dexterity. [Low]
  White Noise Machine: This small and wearable
device generates masking sounds that protect a con-
versation from being audibly recorded or overheard
by anyone not in the immediate vicinity. [Trivial]
  X-Ray Emitter: This device is designed to be used
with either the enhanced vision augmentation (p.
301) or specs (p. 325). It emits a focused beam of
low-powered x-rays that allows the user of either
device to both see and see through most objects using
backscatter x-ray radiation (p. 303). This allows the
character to literally see through walls and into con-
tainers, including ones made of metal. [Low]



DRUGS, CHEMICALS, AND TOXINS
In Eclipse Phase, the transhuman desire to enhance
the body and mind—especially with chemicals—
merges right into humanity’s popular pastime of
recreational substance abuse. Drugs of all kinds,
whether they be chemical, nano-based, or electronic,
are not only popular but widespread. While advances
in biotechnology have eliminated many of the side
effects that once plagued drug users, transhuman
bodies remain complicated environments, and so side
effects (especially with long-term use) are still a factor.
Additionally, addiction is always a consideration for
anyone who gets comfortable with popping the same
pills too often, though there are also drugs for addic-
tion of course
   Drug descriptions include benefits, side effects, no-
ticeable signs that a person is using the drug, addictive-
ness, and effects from long-term use). Descriptions also
include the drug’s Duration and its Addiction Modifier
(see Addiction and Substance Abuse).
SUBSTANCE RULES
These rules explain how to handle drugs and toxins.

CLASSIFICATION OF SUBSTANCES
Substances fall into four categories:
   Chemicals: These are pharmacologically-active
small chemical compounds (toxins, pharmaceuticals,
chemical drugs) that have been produced by chemical
synthesis, nanotech fabrication, or enzymatic biosyn-
thesis in (transgenic) organisms. They include natural-
ly-occurring drugs from known species of (exo-)flora
and fauna, endotoxins produced by biological organ-
isms, enhancements of endogenic substances (designer
drugs), and de novo developments designed for a
specific medical or recreational application. Chemical
drugs affect only biological morphs and pods.
   Biologicals: These include peptides, hormones, and
biologically-based substances like biotoxins, bacteria,
and viral organisms—drugs devised or based on
naturally-occurring endogenic biological substances.
This category also includes infectious biological or-
ganisms that can produce drug-like effects, like virii
and bacteria. Biologicals affect biomorphs and pods
but not synthetic morphs or infomorphs.
   Nanodrugs: These are temporary nanobot colonies
programmed to create a certain effect. While nano-
bots are generally able to target or infect all morph
types except infomorphs, exactly which morphs are
affected usually depends on the pre-programmed
effect (i.e., whether it targets a biological or mechani-
cal mechanism).
   Electronic: Electronic drugs include software and
technology that affect the brain directly, such as ma-
nipulative XP programs or retro-tech like transcranial
magnetic stimulation or cranial electrotherapy. It also
includes narcoalgorithms—programs that reproduce
drug-like effects for AIs, infomorphs, and egos resid-
ing in cyberbrains.

APPLICATION METHODS
There are number of vectors by which a substance
may be applied to a morph.
   Dermal (D): This drug or toxin is absorbed via
the skin (or exterior hull with some nanotoxins) as
either a gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., paste). Slap patches
and slap bands are commonly used, loaded with the
chemical DMSO, which transfers the drug through
the skin.
   Inhalation (INH): This is a gas that is breathed into
the lungs or snorted nasally. Used for inhalers, aero-
sols, powders, and gas grenades/seekers.
   Injected (INJ): This liquid is applied via either
an intramuscular or intravenous injection. Used for
needles and piercing weapons.
   Oral (O): This is a liquid or solid that is absorbed
through the stomach or oral cavity (eating or drink-
ing). Used with pills and liquids.

%%% txt/320.txt
DRUG EFFECTS
If a character is exposed to a drug via its method of
application—for example, they pop a pill, slap on
a dermal patch, are soaked with a splash grenade,
breathe in gas, or get stabbed with a coated weapon—
then they are subject to the drug’s effects. The onset
time determines how long these effects take to kick in,
and the duration determines how long they last.
   While there is no resistance test to ignore a drug or
toxin’s effects once exposed, in some cases (especially
toxins) a test might be called for to determine the
severity of the effects.
   Unless otherwise noted or specifically overridden,
medichines (p. 308) will protect a character from
drug/toxin effects (but not nanodrugs/nanotoxins).
Enhancements like toxin filters (p. 305) may also
impede a drug’s effect or provide complete resistance.
If an antidote is taken in advance or before the effects
kick in, the drug will not work.

ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
Some drugs are addictive, either physically (affect-
ing the morph) or mentally (affecting the ego)—and
sometimes both. Every time a character uses the drug
(or after an appropriate amount of use, as determined
by the gamemaster), they must make a WIL x 3 Test to
avoid addiction. Each drug has an Addiction Modifier
that will modify this test.
   Failure indicates that the character has become
addicted—they immediately acquire the Addiction
negative trait (p. 148). Addiction is measured in three
levels: Minor, Moderate, and Major. The severity de-
termines how often an addicted character needs the
drug and what the negative effects of not using the
drug are.
   An addicted character must continue to make WIL
x 3 Tests as they use the drug, as determined by the
gamemaster. Failure indicates the character’s addic-
tion severity increases.
   The negative effects from not using a drug end
whenever the character does the drug again. Durabil-
ity and Lucidity penalties are not damage, but tempo-
rary decreases to the character’s maximum values; the
character immediately regains the lost Durability or
Lucidity when they do the drug again.
   Addiction is of indefinite duration. To clean up,
the character must stay off the drug for 1 week for
each level of addiction. Resisting this craving is dif-
ficult, and should at least require another WIL x 3
Test, modified by the drug’s Addiction modifier. Play-
ers and gamemasters are encouraged to roleplay an
attempt to kick a habit. Each week the character is
off the drug, the addiction drops by one level. When
it reaches 0, the character is clean ... though there is
always danger of a relapse.
   Physical addictions do not carry over to a new
morph if the character resleeves, but mental ad-
dictions do. If the character uploads and resleeves,
the mental addictions persist, and the morph the
character leaves behind remains physically addicted.
This means that poor or unlucky characters may
occasionally find themselves resleeved into a morph
that has a physical addiction. In this case, the charac-
ter is subject to the physical addictiveness of the drug
but not the mental addiction, although if they break
down and indulge in the drug, they may themself
become physically addicted.
  Characters who resleeve as infomorphs can remain
mentally addicted to a substance despite no longer
having a body. The market is always happy to provide,
though; a wide variety of narcoalgorithms mirroring
the effects of most of the drugs described below are
available for infomorphs and AIs. For the infomorph-
ported narcoalgorithm version of any physically-
only addictive drug described below, consider the
Addictiveness to be effectively physical. The character
remains addicted as long as they are an infomorph,
but they do not remain addicted if they sleeve into a
physical morph.

DRUGS
The drugs described here are usually (but not always
beneficial), and are typically taken intentionally. Drugs
and chemicals used offensively are described under
Chemicals and Toxins, both on p. 323.
  Note that the drugs here are just a representative
sampling. There are thousands if not millions of
drugs in circulation in Eclipse Phase—gamemasters
are encouraged to introduce their own, using these
as guidelines.

COGNITIVE DRUGS
 Nootropics and similar drugs are intended to boost
 the user’s mental faculties.
    Drive: This nootropic speeds up left-right brain
 hemisphere communication, stimulates idea produc-
 tion, and improves concentration, with no usual side
 effects. Users receive a +5 bonus to COG while the
 drug lasts. [Low]
    Klar: Klar boosts alertness and enhances clarity and
 perception. Users report a feeling of being “elevated”
 to a higher level. They receive +5 INT while the drug
 lasts. [Low]
    Neem: Neem is a mnemonic drug that works by
“tagging” experiences and mental input with a set of
 unique sensations that contribute to the formation
 of state-based memories. Neem gummy chews come
 in a variety of fruit flavors shaped like extinct old
 Earth animals. Neem gives characters a +20 bonus
 on COG Tests to recall information they learned
 while on Neem (see Memorizing and Remembering,
 p. 176). The drawback to Neem is that memories they
 accumulate while under the drug’s influence have no
 emotional association. For example, a character who
 witnessed something horrible happening to a friend
 or who had a fight with a romantic partner while on
 Neem would feel no emotional connection whatsoever
 to what happened. [Moderate]

%%% txt/321.txt
COMBAT DRUGS
Combat drugs are an easy way of evening the odds
in a fight.
   BringIt: In some respects more a social than a
combat drug, BringIt stimulates massive bursts of ag-
gression pheromones designed to make the user the
center of attention in a fight. In combat, opponents
within 3 meters of the character not already in un-
armed or melee combat with another character must
pass a WIL x 3 Test or attack the character using Br-
ingIt. The nature of airborne pheromones is imprecise,
however, so if the character using BringIt is within
1 meter of another character hostile to the character
affected, the affected character may opt to attack the
proximate character instead of the BringIt user. Char-
acters using this drug suffer a –20 modifier on social
skill tests. [Low]
   Grin: Grin is an effective opiate and pain sup-
pressant. Users may ignore the –10 modifiers from
2 wounds (not cumulative with similar effects), and
in fact may not even be aware they are injured. Grin
users suffer from tunnel vision, however, and so suffer
a –10 modifier on Perception Tests. [Low]
   Kick: Kick is a strong stimulant that increases the
user’s response time and puts them on edge. The char-
acter gains +10 REF and +1 Speed for the duration of
the drug. Characters under the influence of Kick are
twitchy, however, reacting in a jumpy, cat-like fashion
to sudden or unexpected stimuli. At the gamemaster’s
discretion, they must make a WIL x 2 Test or react
without thinking towards unexpected noises or other
surprises. Long-term users suffer –5 COO. [Moderate]
   MRDR: MRDR is a straightforward and brutal
combat drug. It increases pain tolerance, speed, and
strength. The character receives +10 SOM, +1 Speed,
+10 Durability, and may ignore the –10 modifier of
one wound. Any damage incurred while under the
effects of the drug is taken from the bonus Durabil-
ity first. MRDR users are easily identifiable by the
broken blood vessels in their eyes, tense posture, and
visible tension in the muscles of the face, arms, and
legs. Long-term users suffer –5 SOM. [Low]
   Phlo: Phlo increases alertness and coordination,
making the user more graceful and nimble in a fray.
The character gains +5 COO and +10 on Perception
Tests for the duration of the drug. Everything feels
possible to a character on Phlo, and so they are vul-
nerable to being goaded into actions that might be
foolish or dangerous (apply a –10 modifier to appro-
priate Social Skill Tests). [Moderate]

HEALTH DRUGS
Pharma-foods that boost the consumer’s health and
physical state are common.
  Bananas Furiosas: This drug reverses some of the
effects of de-ionizing radiation on the cells of the
body. Although a pill form is available, it most com-
monly comes in large bunches of bright orange-red
bananas. Bananas reduce the severity of a radiation
dosage (gamemaster determines effect). [Low]

%%% txt/322.txt
  Comfurt: This tasty yogurt treat blocks stress hor-
mones, stabilizes mood, and relieves anxiety, allowing
them to ignore the effect of 1 trauma and temporarily
boosting Lucidity by +5. Any stress suffered while the
drug is in effect is taken from the bonus Lucidity first.
Comfurt also provides a +10 bonus when resisting
attempts to manipulate the user’s emotions. Excessive
use of Comfurt can lead to chronic itchiness caused by
histamine release. [Low]

RECREATIONAL DRUGS
These drugs compete with petals (p. 321) and black
market XP for wasting people’s time and lives away.
   Buzz: This gene-modified variant of BZ is an odor-
less, invisible, extremely powerful hallucinogen. Users
or affected characters will undergo extremely realistic
hallucinations for the duration, and may even “share”
hallucinations with other affected characters. Charac-
ters will suffer a –30 modifier to any tests to remember
what occurred while under the influence. [Moderate]
   Mono No Aware: Taken from the Japanese term
for sadness at the ephemerality of worldly things, this
drug, typically ingested as a tea, is a depressant that
induces a meditative state. Mono No Aware gives the
character a +10 bonus on Art and Sense Tests. With
frequent use, Mono No Aware reacts with pigments
in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge,
even in darker-skinned morphs. [Low]
   Orbital Hash: Good ol’ reefer—but grown in space
using powerful lighting and post-singularity hydropon-
ics. Because space is at a premium in habitats and scum
barges, blocks of hashish are the preferred mode of

 transport and delivery. However, for the wealthy and
 on planets, buds in leaf form are not uncommon. Hash
 allows the character to ignore the effects of 1 trauma,
 but inflicts a –10 penalty on all memory-related tests
 and Knowledge Skill Tests. Hash users exhibit blood-
 shot eyes, lethargic behaviors, and the munchies. [Low]

 SOCIAL DRUGS
 These social lubricants affect the user’s interactions
 with others.
   Alpha: Alpha is a more subtle version of BringIt,
 popular with hypercorp execs, street thugs, and
 anyone else who wants to come across as a domineer-
 ing asshole. The pharm designer who invented it had
 a retro sensibility (and maybe a sick sense of humor);
 Alpha is typically synthesized as a sparkling white
 powder designed to be snorted. Alpha stimulates
 production of threat pheromones, but less bluntly
 than BringIt. Alpha imparts confidence, a feeling of
 power, and alertness. Users can function without sleep
 for 4 days, after which point they need to catch up
 with at least 4 hours of sleep (remember morphs with
 basic biomods require less sleep). Dosed characters
 receive a +20 modifier on Intimidation Tests and +10
 on Persuasion and Networking Tests where attitude is
 a factor (gamemaster discretion). These bonuses only
 apply to characters within 2 meters of the Alpha user.
   On the downside, alpha users are impatient, unfo-
 cused assholes. At the gamemaster’s discretion, Social
 skill modifiers may be reversed to penalties with
 certain types of people. Additionally, Alpha users
 suffer –10 on all COG skill tests related to memory

 and coherent or logical thinking. Long-term users may
 suffer the COG penalty even when not on the drug;
 on it, they may be worse. [High]
    Hither: Want to ooze sexy like a pleasure morph
 on a hot tin roof? For those desiring that slinky je-ne-
 sais-quoi, Hither is the tool. Hither is a clear, slippery
 gel, sometimes with a faint, musky, floral scent. Hither
 is applied to parts of the body with large concentra-
 tions of sweat glands, where the skin quickly absorbs
 it. Hither is a mild euphoriant, imparting a feeling of
 confidence and you-know-you-want-it-ness to the user.
 It also stimulates abundant production of lust phero-
 mones. The character gains a +10 bonus on Persuasion
 Tests against targets who are possible to seduce. At the
 gamemaster’s discretion, this extends to Deception,
 Impersonate, and Networking Tests. [Low]
    Juice: This potent anti-depressant makes it almost
 impossible to have bad feelings or negative thoughts.
 The character is unnaturally happy—often irritatingly
 or strangely so. The character receives a +30 bonus
 against fear or attempts to manipulate their emotions
 in a negative direction, but is also likely to act inap-
 propriately, like giggling over the massive amount of
 spilled blood or cheerfully changing the subject to
 inane topics when someone else is freaking out. [Low]

 NANODRUGS
 Nanodrugs are temporary nanobot infestations that
 apply a specific effect.
    Frequency: Frequency (or Freeq) is a nanodrug de-
 signed as a tool for scientific visualization. It releases
 a small swarm of nanobots into the character’s blood-
 stream that settle in the epidermis, where they act as
 sensors of electromagnetic radiation. This sensory
 input is then injected into the character’s visual and
 tactile sensoria, hitting the user with a sequence of
 novel stimuli, typically a light show or weird tactile
 sensations. Aside from its recreational uses, Frequency
 is good at picking up on localized field radiation with
 a standard Perception Test. A character can take ad-
 vantage of this to spot sensors and hidden electronics.
 Similar to now-obsolete 20th-century hallucinogens
 like LSD and psilocybin, however, a Frequency trip
 can be disorienting and upsetting (the gamemaster
 should apply any modifiers, mental stress, or even
 trauma as they feel appropriate). Characters typically
 experience a period about 1/3 of the way through
 their trip in which sensory input is extremely intense;
 during this period, which usually lasts about 2 hours,
 they are unable to read. [Moderate]

     OTHER NANODRUGS
     Nanodrugs have the capability of making fun-
     damental changes to a body’s biochemistry and
     mental state. The potential effects are too nu-
     merous to list, but gamemasters should consider
     allowing nanodrugs that temporarily apply cer-
     tain traits, such as Brave, Direction Sense, Math
     Wiz, Pain Tolerance, Psi Chameleon, Psi Defense,
     Situational Awareness, Tough, Feeble, Frail, Low
     Pain Tolerance, Mental Disorder, Mild Allergy,
     Neural Damage, Psi Vulnerability, Severe Al-
     lergy, Timid, VR Conditioning, VR Vertigo, Weak
     Immune System, or Zero-G Nausea. Similarly,
     the nanodrug could force the character into a
     particular mental emotional state, such as a bad
     mood, edginess, contentment, or overconfi-
     dence. Gamemasters are encouraged to experi-
     ment with different possibilities and effects. ■



      Gravy: Gravy assists characters in acclimating to
   high gravity environments. It comes in a variety of
   flavors and is often added as a sauce to food. For
   Gravy to be 100% effective, the character must begin
   using it in advance. Reduce penalties for high-gravity
   acclimation by 20. [Low]
      Schizo: Schizo is a nanodrug that mirrors the ef-
   fects of paranoid schizophrenia. It is popular in
   some hyperelite social circles as a truly daring and
   intriguing experience. A dose of schizo looks like a
   disposable antique razor blade. Making an incision
   in the skin releases a swarm of nanobots that travel
   to the central nervous system and induce the effects
   of the drug. While in effect, the character is severely
   paranoid and hears voices. How this plays out is at
   the discretion of the gamemaster, but should include
   irrational fears, unusual compulsions based on the
   instructions of the voice or voices, and a strong pos-
   sibility that the character will behave in a violent or
   destructive fashion. The character may make WIL x 3
   Tests to avoid violent acts against objects or strangers.
   Friends and trusted acquaintances are probably less
   likely to be targets of violence (+30 modifier to avoid
   hurting people the character cares about or destroy-
   ing important possessions). Note that the character’s
   muse is unaffected by Schizo and can make efforts
   to babysit the character. Characters who take Schizo
   suffer 1d10 mental stress. [Low]

SAMPLE PETALS
A few examples of Petal experiences:

FORGOTTEN HAND
One of the character’s hands detaches and makes a
run for it. The character is conscious and able to in-
teract normally with the real world, but they cannot
perceive the “escaped” hand and firmly believe that
it’s getting away. The hand will lead the character
a merry chase, but at some point, a new hand ap-
pears on the character’s wrist. It may be glittery and
opalescent, demonic and clawed, or bestial. Eventu-
ally, after an hour or two, the character will catch up
to their hand, but to get rid of their new hand and
re-attach the old, they must answer cryptic questions
posed by a gnome-like being.

DARKLY SELVING
This petal is believed to achieve many of its effects
by connecting to the mesh, where an AI observes
and controls some of the event flow, and only
works for multiple trippers. Like Forgotten Hand,
it works by overlaying AR perceptions on the real
world, but because of the effects, it’s highly inadvis-
able to take in places where any non-trippers will
be present. Darkly Selving creates an epsilon fork
of each character tripping and sleeves the fork in
an infomorph that looks like a demonic version of
themself, using visual input from the character’s
co-trippers. AR overlays cause the characters to per-
ceive themselves as angelic beings, while the real-
seeming demonic infomorphs appear as AR overlays
on their real world perceptions. What happens next
varies, but generally both the characters and their
forks are subjected to a series of strong chemical




  PETALS
 Petals is a term for a type of narrative hallucinogen,
 a nanodrug that hijacks the senses and takes the user
 on a game-like, highly immersive trip. Known by a
 myriad of intriguing names—Forgotten Hand, Darkly
 Selving, Inquisitive Green, to name a few—Petals are
 post-Fall society’s heroin—the drug of choice for the
 desperate and fucked. Petals almost always appear as
 nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient
 pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing
 the petals from the flower triggers the effects imme-
 diately. Flowers have 5-10 petals. Multiple users may
 share the experience if they take the Petals within 1
 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all
 petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent
 white and become inert.
   Petal experiences are like entire scenarios in and of
 themselves. Some take place entirely in the user’s mesh
 inserts (the user must cede control of their implants
  d narcoalgorithmic stimuli, ranging from Hither-
 e effects to massive doses of MRDR (or sometimes
oth). The effects directed against the forks are
  nerally much more intense. The objective—hinted
  via environmental clues—is to merge with one’s
 rk, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways,
 nging from hunting them down and eating their
  art to solving a puzzle or reaching a goal before
 eir forks can.

 ELPHINIUM SIX
 e last and rarest in a series of petals, Delphinium
x is the Grail of petal users, a supposedly tran-
endental experience that might not even exist.
elphinium One is scarce, Two and Three are quite
 re, Four is an amazing find, and Five and Six
 e only rumors. Hints of what Six might hold are
  sed largely on extrapolation from the little that
 known about the lower-numbered petals. The
 llowing facts are generally accepted. It is a group
 perience, but not all members of the tripping
 oup are rewarded equally. It is intensely surreal,
 t in a purposeful way, as are all of the Delphinium
 ries. It concludes the loosely-built narrative of a
 ugged-out version of a fairy tale princess and her
uest for enlightenment begun in Delphinium One,
 plete with strange omens and mythological crea-
 res. Rumors of what the ending might hold are
ore fanciful, and range from the trippers being
 sleeved in god-like infomorphs to them being
apped forever in an ego prison. Delphinium Six is
 mpletely virtual, leaving the characters comatose
 r the duration, and probably lasts a long time,
  rhaps 40 hours.                                  ■




   voluntarily; if they do not, the drug has no effect other
   than producing very low-intensity LSD-like visual hal-
   lucinations), taking control of the character’s entoptic
   displays, linking to secretive mesh servers and other
   trippers, and invading the character’s sensorium with
   AR “hallucinations.” Others put the character into a
   near-comatose state during which they go on a head
   trip. Normally there is some kind of well-developed
   theme or plot to a Petal experience, although in some
   cases they just experience a stream of images.
      Though most societies seek to suppress Petals, new
   ones appear constantly, fueled by a persistent sub-
   culture of crafters and users. Petalcrafters view their
   work as an art form (or at least as really good enter-
   tainment), and the better Petals are lovingly crafted,
   hauntingly beautiful experiences—even if they’re also
   terrifying. The subculture of Petal use ranges from
   casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-du-
   ration flower to hardcore addicts who spend much of

%%% txt/325.txt
their time not on Petals trying to hunt down the most
intense and esoteric varieties. From this subculture
comes a lot of information on what various Petals
look like and their effects. Because Petals combine
custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and
sometimes connections to mesh servers, duplicating
them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an
active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.
   Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards,
called “sweets” by petal users. Getting the sweets usu-
ally requires fulfilling certain conditions within the
trip, such as correctly answering questions or fulfilling
goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing
or product designs, and custom infomorph sleeves.
   On the negative side, some Petal trips go bad, in-
flicting 1d10 mental stress or more on the user. Per-
haps worse, some Petals are loaded with malware that
takes over the user’s mesh inserts and worse—some
sentinels even whisper of Petals carrying strains of the
Exsurgent virus. [Trivial to High]

NARCOALGORITHMS
Narcoalgorithms are software programs that simulate
the effects of drugs on biological bodies. Almost all
bio, chemical, and nano drugs can be replicated as
narcoalgorithms, with corresponding effect (game-
master discretion). Narcoalgorithms may be run by
infomorphs, egos encased in cyberbrains (pods and
synthmorphs), simulmorphs, and even AIs.
   DDR: Originally crafted by prankster hackers
and distributed as a virus, DDR (for “Dance Dance
Robot”) triggers impulses in the target’s motor con-
trol circuits. Primary targeting robot AIs, the effect is
that targets “dance” in jerky, automated movements.
Pleasure receptors are also activated so that dancing—
and movement of any kind—feels good. Different
software variants invoke different motions and styles.
The target suffers a –20 modifier on other actions
while dancing, but the dancing may be overridden
with a WIL x 3 Test. [Low]
   Linkstate: This software actually connects the user
to a peer-to-peer network, where it randomly con-
nects to other linkstate users and samples a bit of their
XP feed and randomly accessed memories—typically
just enough to provide context, but not enough to
acquire private personal details. These inputs are
spliced together, their emotional inputs amplified, and
then the entire package is spiked with some hormonal
circuit triggers and artificial synaesthesia. The effect
is a mind-blowing mixed sampling of people’s lives,
mashed together in a sensory soup, that hits the mind
with a euphoric rush. Linkstate users are catatonic
while under the effects (typical sessions run 3-4 hours),
but afterwards they often report that they have flash-
backs of events in other people’s lives. [Low]

CHEMICALS
Atropine: Though poisonous in large doses, atropine
is an effective antidote against nerve agents like BTX2
and Nervex. Easily synthesized in a maker, atropine
will avert the effect whether taken soon before or after
dosage by a nerve agent. [Trivial]
   DMSO: This chemical acts as a carrier, allow-
ing other chemicals to be absorbed through the
skin. It allows any chemical agent to be applied
dermally. [Trivial]
   Liquid Thermite: Similar to scrapper’s gel, liquid
thermite comes in a gel form that is easily applied
under all environmental conditions (by the nature
of its chemical reaction, thermite is oxygenated and
will burn underwater or in space). It is ignited with
an electric charge, burning at temperatures exceeding
2,500 degrees Celsius and melting through whatever
it is touching. Liquid thermite inflicts 3d10 + 5 DV per
Action turn to whatever it is touching. Armor will also
be burnt through, offering no protection once the full
Armor rating has been reached. [Moderate]
   NotWater: NotWater is an effective liquid fire re-
tardant that does not get objects wet, no matter how
absorbent they are—it simply beads up and slides
right off. [Trivial]
    Scrapper’s Gel: This goo turns into a potent acid
when given an electrical charge. It comes in a gel-like
state and may be smeared like jelly, and may even be
used in space. In acid form, scrapper’s gel does 1d10
+ 5 DV per Action Turn to anything it touches, unless
the material has been treated against acid. Armor will
protect against this acid at first, but the acid will eat
through the armor, so that it will no longer protect
after its full armor value has been reached. [Low]
    Slip: This liquid is almost entirely frictionless. When
spread around an area (commonly used in splash
grenades), anyone attempting to walk or run on the
affected surface must make a COO Test or fall down.
Likewise, any coated surface becomes extremely
hard to grip onto, requiring a SOM Test to hang on.
Anyone attempting to grapple a slip-soaked character
suffers a –30 modifier. [Low]
   Tracker Dye: This liquid is colorless at normal light
but becomes recognizable under pre-specified different
wavelengths (such as infrared or ultraviolet). [Trivial]

TOXINS
Chemical warfare involves using the toxic properties
of biological and chemical substances to kill, injure,
or incapacitate an enemy. Note that an antidote can
be constructed for most toxins if a sample is acquired
and an appropriate Medicine or Academics Test is
made. This is considered a Task Action with a time-
frame of 1 hour. These toxins only affect biomorphs;
synthmorphs are immune.
   BTX : BTX-squared (also called Frog Bite) is a
genetically-enhanced variant of the extremely potent
cardiotoxic and neurotoxic batrachotoxin. It leads to
fast paralysis and cardiac arrest that usually kills the
target within a few Action Turns. Affected characters
suffer 2d10 + 10 damage a turn for 3 Action Turns;
medichines reduce this damage by half. They must
also make a SOM x 2 Test (+30 with medichines) or
be paralyzed for 1 hour. [High]

%%% txt/326.txt
   CR Gas: This potent incapacitating agent causes
eye twitching and temporary blindness, severe cough-
ing and breathing difficulty, skin irritation, and panic.
Affected characters suffer 1d10 ÷ 2 damage, a –30
modifier to sight-based Perception Tests, and a –20
modifier to all other actions for 20 minutes (5 min-
utes if the character has medichines). [Low]
   Flight: This drug is derived from human pheromones
released due to fear, and is intended to instill alarm or
even terror in the character. Affected characters must
make a WIL x 3 Test (+30 with medichines) or suffer
a panic attack, inflicting 1d10 stress. Dosed characters
also suffer a –30 modifier for resisting intimidation or
fear-based emotional manipulations. Flight affects last
for 1 hour (5 minutes with medichines). [Low]
   Nervex: Derived from deadly nerve agents like cy-
closarin, VX, and novichok, this genetically-modified
toxin is deployed as a colorless, odorless gas that
turns safely inert 10 minutes after deployment. It
causes involuntary contraction of the muscles, sei-
zures, and death by respiratory failure. One minute
after exposure, the character must make a SOM Test
or be incapacitated by seizures, paralysis, or nausea
and vomiting; unaffected characters still suffer a –20
modifier to all actions. After 10 minutes, the character
will die unless an antidote (such as atropine, p. 323) is
applied. Characters with medichines suffer the initial
effects, but recover after 5 minutes. [High]
   Oxytocin-A: A genetically-improved variant of oxy-
tocin, this drug induces trust in the recipient. Drugged
characters suffer a –30 modifier on all WIL and Kine-
sics Tests where trust is a factor. Medichines provide
immunity. [Low]
  Twitch: Twitch is a convulsive agent, a nonlethal
nerve gas. Affected characters must succeed in a SOM
Test (+30 with medichines) or become incapacitated
with severe muscle tremors. Unaffected characters still
suffer a –20 on all actions. The effects of Twitch last for
10 minutes, 5 if the character has medichines. [Low]

NANOTOXINS
Disruption: This nanotoxin attacks the myelin sheath
on nerves, disrupting nerve impulses and inflicting
symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Every hour the morph
suffers a –5 modifier to COO, REF, and COG. If any
aptitudes are reduced to zero,the morph is effectively
paralyzed and catatonic. [Moderate]
   Necrosis: Necrosis nanobots attack the walls of cells
inside the body, killing tissue. This nanotoxin inflicts
1d10 ÷ 2 damage per Action Turn for one minute, after
which the nanobots disable and flush from the body.
Necrosis only affects biomorphs. [Moderate]
   Neuropath: These nanobots are designed to stimu-
late the pain receptors of a morph on a systemic level
to cause agony and impairment. While most neuro-
paths target biological receptors, variants are avail-
able that induce comparable (phantom) pain stimula-
tions in the cyberbrains of synthmorphs to create an
equivalent effect. The affected character must succeed
in a WIL x 3 Test or become incapacitated. Even if
they succeed, they suffer –30 from the inflicted agony.
Any form of pain resistance that allows a character
to ignore wound modifiers will negate the neuropath
pain modifier by an appropriate amount. [Moderate]
   Nutcracker: Nutcrackers are nanobots designed to
locate, migrate, and decompose the synthdiamond
case of a cortical stack within a morph by attacking
its crystal lattice. This process takes approximately
6 hours, after which the cortical stack is destroyed.
These nanobots also attack the cortical stack’s connec-
tions to the (cyber)brain and brain-mapping nanobots.
After 1 hour, the victim will be aware that their corti-
cal stack is threatened. After 3 hours, all connections
will be severed and the cortical stack will no longer be
able to back up the character. [High]

PATHOGENS
A pathogen is an infectious biological agent that
causes disease or illness to its host. While natural
pathogens rarely strive to kill their hosts, germ war-
fare programs revived during the Fall—or instigated
by the TITANs—sought to modify and use pathogens
as a weapon of war. The ideal characteristics of lethal
biological agents are high infectivity, high potency,
availability of vaccines, and delivery as an aerosol.
Most biomorphs are immune to standard pathogens
thanks to their basic bio-mods, and medichines will
protect against most others. However, even these
defenses may not protect against diseases left by
the TITANs or a new terrorist cell’s biowar bug. It
is largely recommended that pathogens be handled
as a plot device, rather than an active threat to the
characters. Pathogens have no effect on synthmorphs.
   Degen: Characters exposed to this degenerative
neurological disease must make a DUR x 2 Test or
become infected. Medichines will defeat the disease,
but others will not show signs of infection for 1 week,
when the symptoms of a rapidly progressing dementia
will become clear: memory loss, personality changes,
and hallucinations. If untreated, Degen will progress
for another week with more serious symptoms, in-
cluding speech impediments, jerky movements, loss
of balance and coordination, and even seizures. This
is reflected by a 5 point loss in all aptitudes per day
(after the first week). When any aptitude reaches 0,
the character dies. Degen is notorious for its effect
in corrupting cortical stack backups before infection
symptoms manifest. [Expensive]
   Trigger: Trigger is a designer virus that selectively
targets and infects mast cells to trigger a hyper-allergic
reaction. The resulting anaphylactic shock due to sys-
temic vasodilatation (associated with a sudden drop
in blood pressure) and bronchial swelling (resulting in
constriction and difficulty breathing) usually leads to
death in a matter of minutes after onset, if not treated.
Infected characters must succeed in a DUR Test (using
their current Durability score minus damage) or die
quickly. Even medichines have difficulty reacting in
time against this virus; characters with medichines
must make a DUR x 2 Test to survive. [Expensive]

PSI DRUGS
Research into the Watts-MacLeod strain has resulted in
several exceptional breakthroughs involving the creation
of psi-impacting drugs. Each of these drugs is in the ex-
perimental stage, but they are already finding some use
among Firewall and similar secretive groupings.
   Inhibitor: Inhibitor is a cocktail of neurochemicals
that block some brain receptor and transmitter func-
tions in an attempt to reduce psi-waves and block or
impair sleights. This drug is commonly used to restrain
async prisoners from using their abilities. A drugged
character must make a WIL x 2 Test. If they fail, they
lose all psi abilities for the drug’s duration. If they suc-
ceed, they suffer a –30 impairment on Psi skills and
all strain is doubled. Inhibitor has an unfortunate side
effect of doping the character down, however; apply
a –10 modifier to their COG. Inhibitor-influenced
characters tend to have a glazed, dopey expression and
have difficulty getting excited or emotional. [High]
   Psi-Opener: Psi-opener drugs are variants of the
Watts-MacLeod strain with a temporary effect and
which do not permanently alter the user’s brain. Psi-
opener temporarily imbues the user with the ability
to use one particular sleight, regardless of whether or
not they have the Psi trait. Each type of Psi-opener is
customized for a particular sleight. While primarily
intended for non-asyncs, non-asyncs may not possess
Psi skills, so they must default to WIL. For this reason,
Psi-Opener is often doubled up with Psike-out.
   Using Psi-opener is a mind-wrenching experience.
Users are occasionally subject to hallucinations
(gamemaster discretion). When the drug wears off, it
inflicts 1d10 points of mental stress, +2 if the drug
imbues a psi-gamma sleight. [Expensive]
   Psike-Out: Psike-out bolsters an async’s psi abilities.
Apply a +20 modifier to the async’s Psi skill tests for the
drug’s duration. However, also apply +2 to all strain
DVs for the drug’s duration. Psike-out is mentally ad-
dictive, with an Addiction Modifier of –10. [Expensive]



EVERYDAY TECHNOLOGY
The following devices are all exceptionally common
and can be acquired in almost any habitat. Almost
everyone in Eclipse Phase either owns these devices or
knows several people who do.
   Ecto: Ectos are the external version of basic mesh
inserts (p. 300), minus the medical sensors. These col-
orful devices serve as a wearable mesh terminal, PDA,
locator, and camera-phone. The devices are flexible
(often worn as bracelets), dirt-resistant, self-cleaning,
and may be stretched out to increase screen size. They
may project holographic displays and are typically
equipped with wireless-enabled glasses or contact
lenses and decorative earpieces or earrings so that the
user may access augmented reality. Given the ubiquity
of mesh inserts, ectos are growing less common, but
they are still used by bioconservatives, others without
implants, and those who prefer to access the mesh via
an external device for security concerns. [Low]

   Holographic Projectors: These devices are capable
of projecting high-definition, ultra-realistic three-
dimensional images and movies. From a distance
(20+ meters), such holograms can be difficult to
distinguish as fake, but up close they are easier to
see for what they are (+20 Perception Test modifier).
Holograms do not appear wavelengths other than
visual light, and so are easily identified by anyone
with enhanced vision. [Low]
  Micrograv Shoes: These shoes are equipped with
velcro and/or a magnetic system, allowing the wearer
to walk normally on appropriate surfaces in micro-
grav and zero-G environments, rather than floating or
bouncing. [Trivial]
   Portable Sensor: This is a small portable (possibly
even wearable) sensor system. The type of sensor must
be chosen (for example: infrared, lidar, radar, x-ray).
Combined sensor systems are also available, at a cu-
mulative cost. See Radio and Sensor Ranges, p. 299.
and Using Enhanced Senses, p. 302. [Moderate]
   Smart Clothing: Smart clothing can change its
color, texture, and even its cut, taking only a minute
or two to transform from a solid color jumpsuit to a
plaid party dress or a replica of a pinstriped, late 20th
century business suit. More advanced (and expensive)
models can also attempt to camouflage their wearers,
providing a +20 bonus to Infiltration Tests to avoid
being seen or noticed, as long as the wearer is station-
ary or not moving faster than a slow walk. When worn
by someone moving faster, the clothing still provides a
+10 modifier. Smart clothing also keeps the character
warm or cool, allowing the character to exist comfort-
ably in environments from –40 to 70 C. [Low]
   Smart Vac Clothing: Just like regular smart cloth-
ing, this outfit can also transform into a light vacsuit
(p. 333). It also functions as armor with a rating of
2/4. [Moderate]

%%% txt/328.txt
   Specs: Specs are vision-enhancing glasses. They
deliver sensory data directly into the wearer’s visual
cortex by connecting with their basic mesh inserts
(p. 300), though visual displays are available for bio-
conservatives and other characters without implants.
Specs extend the range of the wearer’s vision from
terahertz waves to gamma rays (p. 302). Specs in-
clude a t-ray emitter (p. 306), however, using x-rays,
or gamma rays for visual purposes requires a sepa-
rate emitter, since neither of these sorts of radiation
are common inside habitats, or in any safe environ-
ments. Specs have a variable focus equivalent to 5
power magnifiers and provide the wearer with a +10
bonus to all Perception Tests involving vision. [Low]
   Tools: Tools come in kits (portable), shops (can fit
into a large vehicle), and facilities (large, non-mobile).
Each set of tools applies to a particular skill, such
as Hardware: Electronics or Hardware: Groundraft.
[Low (Kit), High (Shop), Expensive (Facility)]
   Utilitool: This hand tool includes a specialized
small nanobot generator. In its basic form, a utilitool
is the size and shape of a large fountain pen. It can
transform into almost any tool, however, from a
wrench, knife, or powered screwdriver to a rotary
grinder or pair of pliers. Some inexpensive utilitools
are optimized for specialized tasks, like cooking
or wilderness survival, but more expensive models
become almost any imaginable hand tool. Utilitools
are normally mentally controlled using the character’s
basic mesh inserts. Characters without such implants
can control the tool via voice commands and touch
controls. Characters using a utilitool gain a +10
modifier to skills involving repairing or modifying de-

NANOTECHNOLOGY
Nanotechnology is the precise manipulation of matter
at the atomic level, typically using millions of micro-
scale nanomachines. Nanotechnology transformed
manufacturing, enabling new techniques and materi-
als. The advent of nanofabrication—building objects
from the molecular level up—transformed economies,
allowing people to simply manufacture whatever they
needed from raw materials. Nanotechnology is still a
growing field, however, and has its limitations. While
the TITANs unleashed self-replicating nanoswarms
with the ability to transform or destroy anything
through the power of geometric growth, such technol-
ogy remains far beyond transhumanity’s grasp.

BASIC NANOTECHNOLOGY
Basic nanotechnology is exceedingly widespread
and used throughout the solar system, serving as the
primary method of manufacturing for decades. The
nanobots of basic nanotech are confined to delicate
and specially-maintained environments like the
insides of cornucopia machines or healing vats and
cannot operate elsewhere.

HEALING VATS
Healing vats were the first type of nanotech medicine
developed and remain the most powerful medical
devices in common use. With the exception of a few
exceptionally deadly nanoplagues, a healing vat can
cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as the
patient is alive when they are place in the healing
vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a
scratch. A healing vat can even take a severed head (as
long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nano-
tech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the
head’s genetics. If the patient’s body or medical records

Major physical modifications like adding limbs or radical changes



 contain information about their implants, bioware, or
 advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications
 are also fully restored.
    Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require
 a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way
 to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or
 bioware. Healing vats use specialized nanomachines
 to either alter the patient’s body or integrate implants
 or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is
 that no additional healing time is needed, the patient
 leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation
 and ready to go. Every hospital, clinic, bodyshop, and
 augmentation parlor has several healing vats. The
 time required by a healing vat varies with the sever-
 ity of the damage it is healing or the extent of the
 modification being made, as noted on the Healing Vat
 table, p. 327. [High]

 NANODETECTORS
 Nanodetectors are small devices that suck in air and
 micro debris in order to scan for and detect nano-
 bots. Given that nanobots are so small, the density of
 nanobots in the area has a large impact on its success.
 The nanodetector has a base skill of 30 for detecting
 nanobots, modified by +30 if an active nanoswarm or
 hive is present, +0 if a nanoswarm or hive was active
 recently, and –10 for the presence of nanobots outside
 of a swarm or hive. Once a nanobot is detected it may
 be analyzed either by the user or the nanodetector’s AI,
 using Academics: Nanotechnology 30 skill. Nanode-
 tectors are often worn and left on, set to alert the user
 if a hostile nanoswarm is detected. [Low]

 NANOFABRICATORS
 Nanofabrication machines are universal assemblers
 that perform almost all of the manufacturing in the
 solar system. The user loads in raw materials and
 electronic plans and it can produce literally any

   manufactured good, from a weapon to an ultralight
   plane to a hot and delicious dinner. Many nanofabri-
   cators come equipped with a library of common-use
   blueprints (basic foods, standard clothing, common
   tools, etc.). Other blueprints must either be purchased
   online, self-programmed, or acquired through some
   other method (see Nanofabrication, p. 284). The larg-
   est nanofabrication units are more than 10 meters on
   a side and are used to produce small consumer goods
   in bulk as well as building large devices like orbital
   transfer vehicles.
      The availability and legality of nanofabricators
   varies widely throughout the system. In the inner
   system and Jovian Republic, cornucopia machines
   are commonly restricted and sometimes illegal, with
   licenses only available to hypercorps, military units,
   and other officials and elites. In these habitats, only
   more limited fabbers are available to the general
   populace. Additionally, blueprints are licensed and
   protected by copyright laws, and many nanofabrica-
   tors feature pre-programmed restrictions that prevent
   them from using unlicensed blueprints as well as
   from manufacturing weapons, explosives, or other
   restricted items. Among the autonomists of the outer
   system, however, nanofabricators are commonly ac-
   cessible, shared by everyone, and unrestricted.
      For rules on creating goods in a nanofabricator, see
   Nanofabrication, p. 284.
      Desktop Cornucopia Machine: Cornucopia ma-
   chines (CMs) are general-purpose nanofabricators.
   The smallest CMs are desk-sized cubes approximately
   half a meter on a side with a volume of at least 40
   liters. They can produce any small object, from tools
   to well-folded suits of clothing to handguns or a bowl
   of cereal. It is sometimes possible to assemble larger
   items, but they must be manufactured in smaller
   pieces and then assembled (likely requiring an appro-
   priate Hardware Test).

%%% txt/330.txt
  While users can purchase bulk raw materials, CMs
also come equipped with a disassembler. The user
loads garbage and other objects into the disassembler
so that they can be turned into raw materials for the
CM. All legally-available disassemblers only decon-
struct non-living material. [Expensive]
   Fabber: Fabbers are specialized nanofabricators,
portable and considerably smaller than CMs. There
are a wide variety of portable fabbers, including
ones that can make any hand tool or small piece of
personal electronics, ones that can turn any organic
material into food and drink, and ones that can create
any drug or medicine as well as bandages and spe-
cialized dressings. The most common fabbers have a
volume of 4 liters. Larger hand tools and devices are
produced as 2 or 3 separate parts that must be fitted
together. Like CMs, fabbers also contain miniature
disposal units. [Moderate]
   Maker: Makers are specially-designed to produce
food and drink for the user. Raw materials can be pro-
vided by the addition of any water-containing liquid
and collected biomass like leftover food, grass, dirt,
dead animals, or transhuman waste. Some models are
built into standard vacsuits. Makers can produce water
and various flavored beverages, as well as ration bars
or thick pudding-like edible gels. With adequate raw
material, a maker can indefinitely provide food and
drink for up to three transhumans. Most units, how-
ever, have a very limited range of flavors and textures
that are widely considered to be fairly bad. Models
with a wider and better range of flavors and textures
are more expensive, but produce food that is consid-
ered adequate or occasionally good. [Low to Moderate]
   Blueprints: If you want a nanofabricator to make
something, you need to instruct the device how to
create it from the molecular level up. Such blueprints
are available for almost every conceivable item out
there. The cost of such blueprints typically equals
the cost of purchasing the item, though factors like
legality and quality may affect the cost as usual (see
Acquiring Gear, p. 296). [One Cost Category Higher
Than Item Cost]

ADVANCED NANOTECHNOLOGY
Advanced nanotechnology includes more recent
developments. Like basic nanotech, advanced nano-
technology cannot self-replicate but the nanobots
can function normally in most environments and are
highly resistant to bacterial attacks and other environ-
mental problems. Typical advanced nanotech consists
of a generator—known as a “hive”—that produces
nanobots as long as it is supplied with raw materials.
Every such hive also includes a miniature disassembly
unit and/or specialized nanomachines that collect
raw materials for the generator. These hives produce
nanobot swarms that are set loose to perform some
function in the world.
  Examples of advanced nanotech include COTs (p.
315), medichines (p. 308), smart dust (p. 316), and
utilitools (p. 326), among others.
   General Hive: General hives are capable of produc-
ing any conceivable type of nanobot with the right
blueprints and/or programming. Even at their smallest
size they are not really portable, with a minimum size
being cubes 30 centimeters on a side and a volume of
25 liters. [Expensive]
   Specialized Hive: Specialized hives are far more
common than general hives, though they can produce
only one type of nanomachines (i.e., choose one type
of nanoswarm per hive). The smallest specialized
hives are approximately the size of a 12-gauge shot-
gun shell or a large cherry tomato. [High]

EGO BRIDGES
Ego bridges are vat devices used for uploading and
downloading minds. See Backups and Uploading, p.
268, and Resleeving, p. 271. [Expensive]

NANOSWARMS AND MICROSWARMS
Swarms are colonies of nanobots or larger microbots
created in a hive, programmed with specific instruc-
tions, and then set free to perform a set task. Each
swarm is composed of hundreds or thousands of
nanobots or microbots, ranging in size from a mi-
crobe to a small insect. Nanobots are typically invis-
ible to the naked eye, though they can be detected
with a nanodetector (p. 326) or nanoscopic vision (p.
311). Microbots are more noticeable but still quite
small, usually the size of a grain of sand or a dust
mote, or occasionally as big as a flea. Individual bots
in a swarm are directed by nanocomputers, with be-
havioral routines modeled on biological insect and
animal swarms. These swarms stick together and
work as a whole, communicating with nanoradios,
nanolasers, or chemical cues, and sharing informa-
tion between each bot in the swarm. Note that nano-
swarms don’t invade inside living bodies (though they
may attack externally)—internal nano is handled by
nanoware (p. 308), nanodrugs (p. 321), and nanotox-
ins (p. 324).
   Nanobots and microbots may be designed with
all manner of miniaturized propulsion systems (see
Mobility Systems, p. 310), with the exception of ionic
drives. They are powered by tiny batteries or solar
cells. Their tiny sensors are very effective at allow-
ing them to identify materials and objects, and so to
target discriminatingly. Nanobots or microbots could,
for example, be programmed to ignore metal objects,
certain types of plants, specific morphs, females, or
specific individuals. Swarms may either be released
directly from a hive or from pre-packaged program-
mable canisters.
   Swarms must be programmed before they are re-
leased. The programming first determines how long
the swarm is active. This timeframe is open-ended,
though most swarms deteriorate into ineffectiveness
after 2 weeks unless they are replenished by a hive.
The programming then sets what area the swarm is
to occupy. This is also open to interpretation and
can vary from “coat this person” to “spread out to a

%%% txt/331.txt
diameter of 20 meters” to “find the nearest chemical
traces and track them to their source.” Finally, pro-
gramming sets any other parameters for the swarm’s
mission—for example, if it should ignore certain ma-
terials, if it should send a report at a predetermined
time, or if it should self-destruct into harmless dust
when it has completed a certain task.
   Programming is generally handled as a Simple
Success Test using Programming (Nanoswarm) skill.
Failure simply infers that the programming is imper-
fect, and so the swarm may not operate completely as
planned. An actual Programming (Nanoswarm) Suc-
cess Test is only called for if the swarm’s programming
is substantially complex or if the character seeks to
have the swarm act outside of its usual set functions.
The bots in each swarm are specially equipped for the
task they are designed for, however, so attempting
to drastically repurpose a swarm may be difficult or
pointless at the gamemaster’s discretion.
   Swarms may also be teleoperated, controlled, and/
or (re)programmed once they are released, via radio
or laser link.
   Swarms are treated as a whole. The standard swarm
size is enough to cover a 10 x 10 x 10 meter cube,
and this is the standard “unit” of swarm released by
a canister or hive. Swarms may be larger, but they are
treated as individual swarm units. Each swarm has
a Durability of 50 and is immune to wounds. Most
attacks against a swarm simply inflict 1 point of
damage. Area-effect weapons, plasma rifles, and fire
inflict 1d10 damage, plasma grenades do full damage.
Swarms are not affected by vacuum.
   Cleaners: This nanoswarm cleans, polishes, and
removes dirt and stains. It may be used on an area,
specific objects, or people. Some facilities employ
permanent cleaner swarms to keep their area spotless.
Cleaners may also be programmed to remove specific
toxins, chemicals, or other hazardous substances in
order to decontaminate an area. Covert operatives
and criminals sometimes use cleaners to eliminate
any evidence they may have left at a scene usable for
forensics purposes, such as blood, hair, or anything
that could be DNA-typed. [Low]
   Disassemblers: Also known as smart corrosives,
these nanobots break down any matter. Their ad-
vantage over common acids is that not only are
they able to break down any material by using
energy to disrupt chemical bonds, but that they
can be programmed to take apart certain compo-
nents while ignoring others, leaving them intact.
Disassemblers are a common weapon used against
synthmorphs, eating away their components with-
out having to worry about accidentally splashing
biomorphs. Upon contact, these nanobots infl ict
1d10 ÷ 2 damage (round up) per Action Turn. Ac-
cumulated damage counts as a wound when the
Wound Threshold is reached. Both Energy and Ki-
netic armor protect against this damage, but these
armors are eaten away as well, so the Armor Value
is reduced by the soaked DV. [High]
   Engineers: Engineer microswarms are used for
various construction purposes: erecting walls, digging
tunnels, sealing holes, reinforcing foundations, and so
on. [Moderate]
   Fixers: This is the nanoswarm version of repair
spray (p. 333). [Moderate]
   Injectors: Injector microswarms are equipped with
tiny needles and a drug payload. A biological target
affected by an injector swarm suffers 1 point of
damage and the effects of the carried drug, chemical,
or toxin. [Moderate]
   Gardeners: This microswarm is useful for a number
of agricultural purposes: killing weeds, planting seeds,
trimming plants, pollinating, and even harvesting
small items. It may also be programmed to simply
defoliate an area. [Moderate]
   Guardians: Guardians watch for and attack other
unauthorized swarms. Guardians inflict 1d10 ÷ 2
damage (round up) on other swarms they come into
contact with per Action Turn. [Moderate]
   Proteans: This nanoswarm is designed to disassem-
ble other materials and objects and to create a single
specific, pre-programmed device from the components
(much like a specialized nanofabricator). The proteans
must be able to scavenge appropriate raw materials
(for example, to create a metallic device the nanobots
must transform something else made of metal). The
construction time takes 1 hour per cost category of
the item (1 hour for a Trivial cost item, 2 hours for
Low, etc.). [High]
   Saboteurs: Sab nanobots are designed to infiltrate
electronics or machinery and sabotage them in small
but difficult to discern ways: severing connections,
disabling components, gumming up moving parts,
etc. Saboteurs inflict damage on devices similar to
disassemblers, but the target is not destroyed and
such damage is not immediately obvious. They inflict
1d10 ÷ 2 points of damage to synthmorphs, bots, and
other devices every Action Turn. Armor has no effect,
but accumulated damage counts as a wound when the
Wound Threshold is reached. [High]
   Scouts: A scout nanoswarm will system-
atically map and explore an area, collecting
samples of all materials and substances it
encounters. The samples are carried back
to the hive or canister and chemically ana-
lyzed. Scouts can also be used for forensic
purposes, collecting DNA samples, analyz-
ing chemical residues, and examining other
evidence. [High]
   Taggants: Taggants seek to lodge themselves
onto everything in their area of dispersal.
Each carries a unique identifier, so that if it is
found later, the tagged person or object can
be linked back to the point they were tagged.
Taggants can be programmed to remain silent,
only responding to query broadcasts made
with the proper crypto codes, or they can be
programmed to broadcast their location back
to the deployer via the mesh. [Low]

    Fur Coat: A so-called “fur coat” is outerwear made
 from a living primitive organism. The creature’s skin,
 fur, or scales are real. The organism is cultivated from
 transgenic stocks and grown around molds into cloth-

       Superthermite Charges: These powerful and highly
    stable demolition charges are made from a combina-
    tion of nanometals and metal oxides. A single charge
    can be used to create an explosive blast inflicting
    2d10+5 damage. This charge can be shaped with a
    successful Demolitions Test, focusing the blast in a
    particular 90-degree direction (for example, to blow
    through a door). This triples the damage of the blast
    in the focused direction; in all other directions, the
    damage is reduced to 1/3rd (round down). Multiple
    charges apply a cumulative effect. [Moderate]

    that they can buy backup insurance later or that
    someone that cared about them will see to a re-
    sleeving. [Moderate]
       Backup Insurance: In the event of verifiable
    death, or after a set period of being missing, backup
    insurance will arrange for your cortical stack to be
    retrieved and your ego downloaded into another
    morph. If the cortical stack cannot be retrieved, your
    most recent backup is used. Most policies require
    that the holder provide a backup to be uploaded
    into secure storage at least twice a year. This industry
    works in a manner similar to insurance underwriting
    in terms of cost and individuals engaged in high risk
    professions can expect to pay a premium for the ser-
    vice. Additionally, attempts to retrieve a cortical stack
    are minimal unless one wants to pay for some extra

   Morph Brokerage: Acquiring a new morph is not
always easy and is affected by factors such as the type
of morph, sought-after enhancements/customizations,
and local availability. Numerous brokerage services
exist to find you what you need, or close to it. With
enough lead-time, it may be possible to grow a pod
that closely imitates your morph of choice. A willing-
ness to accept used/traded-in morphs helps to reduce
costs. For more details, see Morph Brokerage, p. 276.
   Psychosurgery: A character can purchase time in an
immersive high-fidelity simulspace with expert care
from psychosurgeons and AIs in order to cope with
derangements and disorders that build up as a result
of existing in a transhuman universe. For an addi-
tional price the procedure can be time shifted to speed
up the relative time within the simulspace. For more

   Space Travel: Space transport cost depends on a
number of factors like distance, quality of lodgings,
and how much cargo you’re bringing with. At the low
end, an intra-habitat shuttle trip within the same clus-

someone else’s experiences. Depending on the content,
some XP (porn, snuff, crime, etc.) may be restricted in
certain jurisdictions. Some XP clips are intentionally
modified so that their emotive tracks are more intense,
giving the viewer a greater thrill. [Low to High]

AIS AND MUSES
Every character starts with a personal muse for free.
Many devices also come with pre-installed AIs, ca-
pable of helping the user, responding to commands, or
even operating the device on their own. Rules for AIs
can be found on p. 264.
   Below are some commonly available AI programs.
Unless otherwise noted, these AIs have aptitudes of 10.
These AIs may also be equipped with skillsofts (p. 332).

SCORCHERS
Scorchers are damaging neurofeedback programs used
to torment hacked cyberbrains (p. 261).
   Bedlam: Bedlam programs assault the ego with
traumatic mental input, inflicting mental stress.
Victims are overwhelmed with horrific, monstrous,
sanity-ripping sensory and emotional input. Each
attack inflicts 1d10 SV. [High]
   Cauterizer: This scorch program rips into the ego
with destructive neurofeedback routines. Each attack
with a cauterizer inflicts 1d10 + 5 DV on the target
ego. This damage is reflected as digitized neurologi-
cal damage. [High]
   Nightmare: Nightmare programs trigger anxiety
and panic attacks within the victim by stimulating the
neural circuitry representing the amygdala and hip-
pocampus. The target ego must make a WIL x 2 Test.
If they succeed, they are shaken but otherwise unaf-
fected, suffering a –10 modifier to all actions until the
end of the next Action Turn. If they fail, they suffers
1d10 ÷ 2 stress damage and are overcome with panic.
This causes them either to blindly flee, have a nervous
breakdown, or cower in frozen shock (gamemaster’s
discretion). This panic episode lasts for 1 Action Turn
per 10 points of MoF. [High]
   Shutter: Shutters target the victim’s sensory cortices,
inflicting a –30 modifier to one chosen sense. Double
this modifier if the attacking hacker scored an Excel-
lent Success. This modifier reduces at the rate of 10
points per Action Turn. [High]
   Spasm: Spasm programs are design to incapacitate
the ego with excruciating pain. Affected targets must
immediately make a WIL x 2 Test. If they fail, they
immediately convulse, are disabled, and writhe in
agony for 1 Action Turns per 10 full points of MoF.
If they succeed, they still suffer a –30 modifier to all
actions, which reduces at the rate of 10 points per
Action Turn. Due to the nature of the delivery, pain
tolerance of any sort has no effect. [High]
SKILLSOFTS
Skillsofts are used with skillware implants (p. 309).
  Standard Skillsoft: These programs provide the
character with a rating of up to 40 in a single Active
skill. [High]

SURVIVAL GEAR
The following gear is often critical to the survival of
 soldiers, spies, criminals, gatecrashers, emergency ser-
 vice personnel, and others who regularly venture into
 unsafe or unfamiliar regions.
    Breadcrumb Positioning System: This worn device
 leaves micro “breadcrumbs” behind as the character
 moves. These devices interact with mesh inserts (or
 ectos) as long as they are within range (50 meters),
 allowing the user to map their position in relation to
 the breadcrumb trail. This is useful in derelict habitats,
 wilderness, and other areas where there is no local
 functioning mesh, and is helpful both for mapping
 and for finding one’s way back. [Low]
    Electrogravitics Net: Also called a safety net, this fail-
 safe system uses electric fields to counter gravity when
 falling. While the system is not able to actually levitate
 heavy objects, it will slow down a fall enough that the
 user can land safely if the gravitational force is not too
 high (the fall height is not greater than 50 meters in
1G). Generating these electric fields consumes a lot of
 energy, so the net is only charged for one use only and
 needs to be recharged afterwards. [Moderate]
    Electronic Rope: The
 fibers in this rope can be
 controlled electronically,
 making it move in a snake-
 like fashion, stiffen up, and
 even wrap around objects.
Typically comes in a 50-
 meter length capable of
 supporting 250 kg. [Low]
    Emergency Bubble: Com-
 monly used as a last resort
“life raft” on spaceships, an
 emergency bubble is made
 of advanced smart materi-
 als and comes in a por-
 table package that can be
 quickly inflated (1 Action
Turn) around the user, usu-
 ally inside an airlock. The
 bubble has a 5-meter diameter and can comfortably
 accommodate 4 people. It maintains 1 atmosphere of
 pressure in a vacuum, protect the inhabitants from
 temperatures ranging from –175 to 140 C, and pro-
 vide light, breathable air and water and food recycling
 for up to four human-sized inhabitants, using its built
 in maker (p. 327). It features a simple airlock, carries
 an emergency distress beacon (below), and can be
 transparent, opaque, or polarized. It is powered by a
 small nuclear battery and also includes comfortable
 inflatable furniture. [Moderate]

%%% txt/335.txt
   Emergency Distress Beacon: This small but power-
ful transmitter is powered by a nuclear battery and
will broadcast any programmed distress call for years.
Though portable and medium-sized, this beacon has
a range of 500 km in urban areas and 5,000 km else-
where. [Moderate]
   Flashlight: These handheld, wearable, or portable
lights can display light in the normal visual spectrum,
infrared, or ultraviolet, as desired. [Trivial]
   Nanobandage: Characters without medichines must
rely on external sources of healing. The most common
option is the nanobandage—a plum-sized advanced
nanotechnology generator built into a reusable, self-
sterilizing bandage. It can treat all forms of injury and
illness, from poisoning to burns to trauma. Characters
simply apply the bandage to the wound and let the
nanobots do the work. It removes pain and discom-
fort and speeds healing (see Biomorph Healing, p.
208). For especially severe injuries, physical first aid
such as setting bones and removing projectiles may
be necessary (gamemaster’s choice). If the wounds are
too severe (the patient has suffered more than five
wounds), the unit places the patient in medical stasis
and radios for emergency services. [Trivial]
   Repair Spray: This nanobot generator creates
nanobots designed to repair synthmorphs, vehicles,
and other common objects. Repair spray contains
the specifications and plans for almost all commonly
used synthmorphs and devices and is a ubiquitous
household item. If it does not contain the specifica-
tions for something it is being used to repair, it must
query the object’s voice for these details, otherwise it
cannot repair it. Simply touch it to the damaged area,
push the button on top, and it sprays out a number of
nanobots sufficient to make repairs. These nanobots
repair 1d10 points of damage per 2 hours. Once all
damage is restored, the nanobots repair wounds at
the rate of 1 per day. Repair spray also cleans and
polishes items and returns them to a pristine and
new state. Repair spray is not effective on any object
with more than 3 wounds, but it provides a +30 to
all repair rolls on anything too badly damaged for it
to fully repair (see Synthmorph and Object Repair, p.
208). [Low]
   Shelter Dome: A variant of the emergency bubble,
this package unfolds into a dome with a 2.5-meter
ceiling and a floor 4 meters across. To safely use this
shelter, it must be staked down to the surface it is
placed on. [Moderate]
   Spindle: A spindle is an advanced nanotechnology
generator that produces a super-strong cable. It can
produce up to 2 kilometers of 0.2 millimeter diameter
line than can support up to 250 kilograms before it
needs more raw materials. The spindle can produce
up to 20 meters of cable every second. It can produce
line in a continuous length or cut the cable it produces
to any length. Spindles can also reabsorb their cable,
retracting it at a rate of 5 m per second. As long as
it is recharged and has small amounts of additional
material added every 1,000 hours of use, a spindle
can keep producing and retracting cable indefinitely.
By setting the maximum production speed at 10 m/
second a character with a spindle can safely jump
off a building and land safely, using the cable to slow
their descent. [Moderate]
   Spindle Climber: This device attaches to a spindle
and transforms it into a highly effective climbing
device. The spindle climber has two functions. First, it
attaches hardened tips to the spindle’s cable and fires
it at high speed, up to 50 meters, with sufficient force
to imbed the tip into almost any sufficiently durable
surface. Second, the spindle climber can pull itself and
up to 250 kg up the cable at a speed of up to 2 m/sec.
A spindle climber has enough power to shoot and pull
up the cable 50 times before it must be recharged. A
spindle fits inside a spindle climber. [Low]

VACUUM SUITS
Most vacuum suits are skin-tight garments that use
the pressure of their advanced smartfabrics on the
wearer’s body to resist vacuum. When the wearer is in
a breathable atmosphere, the smartfabric also loosens
the suits to serve as ordinary clothing or be easily
put on or taken off. In all cases, the suits can become
skin-tight within 3 Action Turns. All vacsuits contain
advanced rebreather units capable of maintaining a
breathable atmosphere for several hours or days.
   Light Vacsuit: Everyone living in a sealed habitat
owns at least one of these suits. They come in a vari-
ety of forms. Inexpensive versions are typically light-
weight jumpsuits made of simple smart fabric that
adjusts to fit and folds up small enough to fit into a
coat pocket. The best models include suits of high-end
smart clothing that can transform into a vacsuit and
an advanced nanotech generator the size of a large
orange that deploy nanobots that cover the user and
fit together into a vacuum suit. Both can transform
into a vacsuit in 2 full Action Turns and do so either
on command or if their sensors reveal that life sup-
port is needed.
   All models include a lightweight belt or torc
containing a miniature oxygen tank and advanced
rebreather unit that provides 3 hours of air. How-
ever, the suits contain no food or water recycling. All
models include an ecto (p. 325) and a headlight, but
typically little else beyond atmosphere sensors to let
the wearer know when it is safe to take off the suit.
They protect the wearer from temperatures from –75
to 100 C. These vacuum suits also provide an Armor
rating of 5/5 and instantly self-seal breaches unless
more than 20 points of damage are inflicted at once.
[Low, Moderate for smartfabric suits]
   Standard Vacsuit: These suits resemble light vac-
suits made from thicker and more durable materials
that resist tearing and provides the wearer with light
armor. They are fitted with more substantial life sup-
port belts that includes a maker (p. 327) capable of
recycling all wastes and producing air for up to 48
hours and food and water indefinitely. The best suits
are made of smart materials that can transform from

%%% txt/336.txt
standard clothing to vacuum suits in a single Action
Turn, and will do so automatically if life support is
needed. Each suit also contains an ecto (p. 325), a
radio booster (p. 313), and sensors equal to specs (see
p. 325). These suits have an Armor rating of 7/7 and
protect the wearer from temperatures from –175 to
140 C. They can almost instantly seal any hole unless
more than 30 points of damage are inflicted at once.
[Moderate, High for smartfabric suits]
   Hard Suit: This heavy-duty suit can almost be
considered a miniature space ship. Hard Suits look
like large metallic ovals with jointed arms and legs.
They are quite heavy, but the user can move relatively
easily by using servo assist motors in all the major
joints of the arms and legs. Unlike other vacsuits, they
are solid and can resist both vacuum and up to 100
atmospheres of external pressure. Characters wearing
hard suits can safely explore the upper atmosphere
of a gas giant. They are well armored against punc-
tures and radiation and possess miniature plasma
thrusters capable of delivering 0.01G for 10 hours. A
built-in high quality maker produces sufficient food,
air, and water that a user can remain in a hard suit
indefinitely. Explorers have used them continuously
for up to 2 months. Their gloves incorporate smart
materials that allow each hand to use the equivalent
of a utilitool (p. 326). Hard suits also contain radios
and sensors equivalent to those on standard vacsuits.
These suits have an Armor rating of 15/15, are main-
tained by a fixer nanohive (p. 329), and are instantly
self-sealing of any breach unless more than 30 points
of damage are inflicted at once. They protect the
wearer from temperatures of –200 to 180 C. [High]



WEAPONS
A wide range of weapons are available in Eclipse
Phase, from the primitive to the technologically
advanced.

MELEE WEAPONS
Melee weapons are those wielded by hand (or foot) in
melee combat. They are divided by the skill be which
they are used.

BLADES
These weapons are wielded with Blades skill.
   Diamond Axe: Commonly found on many habitats
for fire and emergency purposes, axes require two
hands to wield. Their blades are diamond-coated for
superior cutting ability. [Low]
   Flex Cutter: The blade of this machete-like weapon
is made of a memory polymer. When deactivated, the
blade is limp and flexible, and may even be rolled up
or otherwise easily concealed. When activated, how-
ever, the blade stiffens and sharpens into a vicious
slashing weapon. [Low]
   Knife: A standard cutting implement, still carried
by many. [Trivial]
   Monofilament Sword: Though swords are rather
archaic in the time of Eclipse Phase, a few eccentrics
take advantage of modern versions with a self-
sharpening near-monomolecular edge, easily capable
of slicing through metal or limbs. [Low]
   Vibroblade: These buzzing electronic blades vibrate
at a high frequency for extra cutting ability. This
has little extra effect when stabbing or slashing, but
provides an extra –3 AP and +2d10 damage when
carefully sawing through something. [Low]
   Wasp Knife: Wasp knives are equipped with a can-
ister in their handle. The common use is to fill these
canisters with pressured air, which inflates inside
the target. This is potentially lethal in vacuum or
pressurized environments (like underwater), as the
gas bursts out of the body cavity to escape (+2d10
damage in such situations). Wasp knives may also
be loaded with chemicals, drugs, or nanobots. The
target must be damaged for the canister’s contents to
affect them. [Low]

CLUBS
Characters use Clubs skill when using these weapons.
  Club: Clubs encompasses a wide range of one-hand-
ed blunt objects, from saps to sticks to pipes. [Trivial]
  Extendable Baton: This hardened composite baton
retracts into its handle for easy carrying, storage, or
concealment. Extending it simply requires a flick or
an electronic signal. [Trivial]
  Shock Baton: Shock batons are standard clubs
used for policing duties, but when activated they also
deliver an electric shock to struck targets (see Shock
Attacks, p. 204). [Low]

EXOTIC MELEE WEAPONS
Unusual weapons requires a specific Exotic Melee
field skill to use.
   Monowire Garrote: This assassin’s weapon fea-
tures a dangerous monomolecular wire wrapped
around a contained spool with two handles. One
handle grips the spool, while the other extends the
wire so that it may be used to wrap around targets
(typically necks or limbs) and slice through them
when pulled. Monofilament tensile strength is weak,
however, usually breaking after one use. [Moderate]

UNARMED
These weapons are wielded using Unarmed Combat skill.
  Densiplast Gloves: These gloves extra-harden when
activated, for extra punch. [Trivial]
  Shock Gloves: When activated, these gloves deliver
an incapacitating shock along with every punch or
grab. Note that the effect is the same whether wearing
one glove or two. [Low]

%%% txt/337.txt
 KINETIC WEAPONS
 Kinetic weapons damage the target by firing a hard
 impact projectile at high-velocities. Slugthrowers
 have evolved from the mechanical firearms of the
 early 21st century, however, and now fall into two
 categories: chemical firearms and railguns. Though
 their mechanisms for firing are different, they are
 roughly similar in effect. Railguns have a higher
 penetration and inflict more damage, which is offset
 by more limited ammunition choices. While modern
 beam weapons have their uses, they rarely match the
 punch of kinetic weapons, therefore slugthrowers
 are still perceived as the most versatile and effective
 weapon system.
   Kinetic weapons are constructed from lightweight,
 reinforced plastoceramic materials, which are easily
 produced even without nanofabrication. By default,
 modern kinetic weapons are ambidextrous but more
 importantly feature safety and smartlink systems (p.
 342) that automatically connect to the wielder’s mesh
 inserts for firing assistance, target recognition, and
 tactical networking.
   The wielder of a firearm or railgun uses Kinetic
 Weapons skill. For information on firing modes, see
 p. 198. For different ammunition types, see p. 336.
 Ranges are listed on p. 203.

 FIREARMS
 Modern chemical firearms use caseless ammuni-
 tion that is auto-loaded from a magazine. They are

   fluid mechanisms) and electronically fired (an electric
   charge vaporizes the propellant, using the expanding
   steam and plasma to eject and accelerate the projectile).
      Note that older, pre-Fall firearms still exist and are
   traded by black marketeers, though they use outdated
   system such as liquid propellants or cased ammuni-
   tion. At the gamemaster’s discretion, these relics may
   suffer shorter ranges, less penetration, fewer firing
   modes, or reduced damage.
      Pistols: Pistols are small-sized (p. 297) and de-
   signed for one-hand use. Light pistols sacrifice pene-
   trating ability for concealability. Heavy pistols focus
   on stopping power, with medium pistols occupying
   a middle ground. All versions fire in semi-automatic,
   burst-fire, and full-auto modes. [Low]
      Submachine Guns: SMGs use pistol ammuni-
   tion, but are medium-sized (p. 297) and may fire in
   semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes. They typi-
   cally are designed in a bullpup configuration for
   close quarters operations and are ideal for tactical
   and strike teams. [Moderate]
      Automatic Rifles: Automatic rifles use rifle ammu-
   nition and have greater range and penetration than
   SMGs. They fire in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto
   modes. They are two-handed weapons. [Moderate]
      Sniper Rifle: Sniper rifles are optimized for range,
   accuracy, penetration, and stopping power. They fire
   in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes, and are
   two-handed weapons. [High]

BRAND NAME WEAPONS
AND COMBINED ARMS
The weapons listed in this book define generic
samples of each weapon. Gamemasters are en-
couraged to offer brand name versions of each
weapon, each with its particular idiosyncrasies
and small variations. For example, a Direct
Action A30 SMG might lack a semi-automatic
setting but come equipped with an extra ammo
capacity of 35. Likewise, a Medusan Arms Longi-
nus sniper riﬂe may inﬂict an extra +2 damage
but have an AP of only –12.
  Similarly, many of the weapons listed here are
available as combined arms weapons systems. A
police-issue assault riﬂe may also feature a stun-
ner—all built into the same weapon. For com-
bined arms, simply add together the individual
weapon component costs.                         ■



   Machine Gun: Machine guns are heavy weapons,
 typically mounted, and intended to provide continu-
 ous fire for support or suppressive purposes. They fire
 in burst fire or full auto modes, and are two-handed
 weapons. [High]

 RAILGUNS
 Railguns use a pair of electromagnetic rails to slide
 and accelerate a non-explosive conductive projectile at
 extremely high velocities (Mach 6+) to create an over-
 whelming, penetrating attack. The kinetic energy of

     the projectile exceeds that of an explosive-filled shell
     of greater mass and creates shock and heat waves
     upon impact that shatter and incinerate the target, or
     portions of it. While railguns are more potent than
     firearms, the ammunition choices are limited as the
     projectile must be conductive and able to survive
     both acceleration and heat created in the process due
     to friction. Nanofabrication allows railguns to be
     manufactured on the personal weapons scale while
     high-energy portable batteries provide the power to
     fire them. Railgun operation is silent except for the
     supersonic crack of the projectile.
        Railguns are available in the same models as fire-
     arms (pistols through machine guns), with the follow-
     ing modifications:

      • Increase AP by –3
      • Increase damage by +2
      • Increase the maximum for each range category
        by x1.5
      • Increase Cost category by one
      • Railguns may only use regular and armor-pierc-
        ing ammunition
      • Railguns also require battery power for each shot.
        Standard railgun batteries hold enough power for
        200 shots, after which they must be recharged at
        the rate of 20 points per hour.

     KINETIC AMMUNITION
     Ammunition is defined by its various types (standard,
     gel, APDS, etc.) and by the class of gun (light pistol,
     heavy pistol, SMG, etc.). For simplicity, each gun
     can trade ammunition with another gun of its class,
     though ammunition for firearms and railguns is not

exchangeable. For example, all railgun SMGs can
share ammo.
  The ammunition’s Damage Value and Armor Pen-
etration modifiers are added to the weapon’s base
DV and AP. With the exception of regular and armor-
piercing rounds, none of this ammunition may be
used with railguns. Listed costs are per 100 rounds
of ammunition.
  Armor-Piercing: This tungsten-carbide ammunition
penetrates armor effectively. [Low]
   Bug: Bug rounds are equipped with a microbug and
medical sensor nanobots. They attempt to gather in-
formation on the target’s location (via standard mesh
tracking), health (querying the target’s medichines),
and surroundings (typically hindered by being inside
the target’s body). They will transmit status reports
in a pre-programmed manner via the mesh or a pre-
chosen frequency band either continuously or in pre-
set intervals. [Low]
   Capsule: Capsule ammo carries a payload (drug,
toxin, nanobots) that is released inside the target after
the round penetrates. [Trivial plus payload cost]
   Flux: Flux ammo is made from rheological materi-
als that allow each bullet to be “programmed” so that
they may change from regular rounds to less-lethal soft
plastic-like rounds. This allows the firer to choose the
type of round (regular or plastic) made with each shot
or burst, and then change with the next one. [Low]

   Hollow-Point: Hollow-point bullets are designed to
deform and widen once they penetrate a target, thus
inflicting more damage. [Trivial]
   Jammer: Jammers stick to the target and pulse out
jamming electromagnetic signals, jamming the target’s
wireless communications. If an Opposed Test is called
for, these devices have an Interface of 30. See Radio
Jamming, p. 262. [Low]
   Plastic: Plastic ammo is designed to hurt but not
wound targets, and is commonly used for crowd con-
trol purposes. [Trivial]
   Reactive: The casing on these projectiles is made
of reactive materials that release a large amount of
energy when subjected to a sudden shock or impact—
such as striking a target. In other words, they explode
or superheat when they hit. [High]
   Reactive Armor-Piercing (RAP): This is a tung-
sten-carbide armor-piercing round with a reactive
casing, allowing the ammunition to penetrate even
further. [Moderate]
   Regular Ammo: This standard metal projectile is
designed to put holes into morphs. [Trivial]
   Splash: Splash rounds carry a payload like capsule
ammo, but are designed to break upon impact rather
than penetrating, splashing their contents on the
target’s exterior. Splash rounds are typically loaded
with paint, taggant nanobots, tracker dye, and similar
substances. [Trivial plus payload cost]
   Zap: Zap rounds are rubber or gel bullets that
create an electric charge upon firing in a piezoelectric
like manner to stun the target effectively with both
the bullet and the electric shock. [Trivial]



SMART AMMO
Smart ammunition takes advantage of nanotechnol-
ogy to produce bullets that can alter their flight path,
home in the target, and correct aim. Smart ammo may
not be used with railguns. With the exception of biter,
flayer, and proximity rounds, smart ammo may be
combined with other ammo types (accushot armor-
piercing, for example).
   Accushot: Accushot bullets change shape within
flight to keep dead on course, countering the effects
of wind, drag, and gravity over distance. Attacks
made with accushot bullets ignore all range modi-
fiers. [Low]
   Biter: Biters are specially-designed to fragment in
opposite proportion to the hardness of the target they
strike. For hard targets (synthmorphs), they frag-
ment very little, blasting a big hole. For soft targets
(biomorphs), they fragment and tumble in multiple
directions within the body. [Low]
   Flayer: Flayers have nanosensors to detect an on-
coming impact, shooting out monomolecular barbs
as they are about to strike a target. These monowires
cut through the target along with the bullet, inflicting
additional damage. [Low]
   Homing: When fired with a smartlink system, the
bullet identifies the target and uses nanosensors to
lock on, correcting the bullet’s trajectory with surface
alterations and tiny vectored nozzles. Apply a +10
modifier to the Attack Test, cumulative with aiming
and smartlink modifiers. Homing bullets may also be
used for indirect fire (p. 195). [Low]
   Laser-Guided: These bullets function like homing
smart rounds (apply the +10 attack modifier), except
rather than requiring a smartlink system, they lock
onto the reflection of the laser sight used to paint
the target. Laser-guided bullets may also be used for
indirect fire (p. 195). [Low]
   Proximity: Proximity is an explosive ammunition
that identifies the target when fired via smartlink. If
the round determines that it will miss the target, it will
still explode if it reaches the close proximity of the
target. If the attack misses with an MoF of 10 or less,
the round explodes 1d10 meters away from the target
and inflicts 1d10 area effect damage (see Blast Effect,
p. 193) in the proximity of the target. [Moderate]
   Zero: Similar to homing smart rounds, zero bullets
identify the target when fired via smartlink. Whether
the round hits or misses, however, it sends telem-
etry data back to the next zero bullet, allowing it to
course-correct and “zero in” to hit the target (or hit
more accurately). Apply a +10 modifier to each shot
(or burst) fired after the first against the same target in
the same Action Turn. [Low]

BEAM WEAPONS
Beam weapons is a broad category for a number of elec-
tromagnetic weapons with a wide range of effects. With
a few exceptions, energy weapons are primarily used for
less-than-lethal purposes, designed to impair the target
rather than kill it. Their poor performance against armor,
lesser ability to damage targets, and high power require-
ments make them less versatile than kinetic weapons.
The wielders of such weapons use Beam Weapons skill.
   Beam weapons are powered by nuclear batteries.
This battery is good for a list number of shots before
it is depleted. Batteries may be recharged at the rate
of 20 shots per hour.
   Laser Pulsers: Laser weapons use focused beams of
light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it
and causing it’s outer surface to vaporize and expand,
creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed
in order to bite into the target before the beam is dif-
fused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects
like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however—the game-
master should reduce their effective range categories
as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in
the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to charac-
ters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized
(p. 297) and fire in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]
   One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed
in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at
the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by
a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a
flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target.
This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius.
Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2

%%% txt/341.txt
 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with
 any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target
 is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses
 their next action. A critical failure means the target
 is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per
 10 points of MoF. In this stun setting, the pulser fires
 only in single-shot mode.
    Microwave Agonizer: The agonizer fires millimeter-
 wave beams that create an unpleasant burning sen-
 sation in skin (even through armor) and to metals.
 Agonizers have two settings. The first is an active
 denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the
 target, inflicting –20 to the target’s actions and forc-
 ing them to move away from the beam on their next
 action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with
 Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer
 a –10 modifier and roll WIL x 2). Synthetic morphs
 and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the
 equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second
 setting (colloquially known as the “roast” setting) has
 the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the
 target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally devel-
 oped for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for
 repelling animals. The agonizer is small-sized (p. 297)
 and fires in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]
    Particle Beam Bolter: This weapon shoots a bolt of
 accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer
 massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, su-
 perheating and creating an explosion when striking.
 The bolter’s beam is not diffused by the cloud that
 occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetra-
 tion than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not
 affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter’s beam is
 invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either
 atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation,
 and will not function in the opposite environment
 (though bulkier dual models, combining both models,
 are also available). Bolters fire in semi-auto mode and
 are rifle-sized two-handed weapons. [High]
    Plasma Rifle: This bulky, heavy, two-handed
 weapon blasts a stream of nova-hot plasma at the
 target, inflicting severe burns and thermal damage,
 possibly melting or evaporating the target entirely.
 Plasma rifles are perhaps the deadliest man-portable
 weapons in use. Plasma guns suffer from dangerous

    Turn of cool-down time after every 2 shots. Plasma
    rifles only fire in single shot mode. [Expensive]
       Stunner: The stunner is an electrolaser that cre-
    ates an electrically-conductive plasma channel to the
    target, down which it transmits a powerful electric
    current, shocking the target. Stunners do not work in
    vacuum. Stunners fire in semi-auto mode. [Moderate]

    SEEKERS
    Seekers are a combination of automatic grenade
    launcher, micromissile, coilgun, and smart munitions
    technology. Unlike traditional launchers of the past,
    miniaturization allows the manufacture of seeker mi-
    cromissile launchers in personal weapon sizes. Seeker
    rounds are fired at high-velocity via rings of magnetic
    coils, after which the micromissile or minimissile uses
    scramjet technology to propel itself and maintain high
    velocities over great distances. Seekers are wielded
    using Seeker Weapon skill.
       Seeker missiles are detailed on p. 340. Like gre-
    nades, seekers may be programmed for a variety of
    trigger events (see Grenades and Seekers, p. 199). All
    seeker weapons are smartlink-equipped (p. 342).

    launcher is pre-packed with one standard missile.

       Seeker Armband (Micromissile): This weapons unit
    is worn on the arm, allowing the user to point and
    fire using an entoptic smartlink system. Though highly
    portable, the armband’s micromissile supply is low. It
    fires in single-shot mode. [Moderate]
       Seeker Pistol (Micromissile): This pistol-sized
    seeker launcher fires micromissiles in semi-auto
    mode. [Moderate]

 SPRAY WEAPONS
 Spray weapons blast their ammunition outwards in a
 widening cone, allowing them to strike several targets
 at once. These weapons are wielded with Spray Weap-
 ons skill. Spray weapon ammunition has a flat cost
 of Low per 100 shots (with the exception of buzzers,
 which use nanoswarms).
    Buzzer: Equipped with a specialized nanobot hive,
 Buzzers are used to spray a nanoswarm (p. 328) on a
 target or area. They have a limited capacity of swarms,
 though the nanohive can construct one new swarm
 each hour. This weapon is two-handed. [Moderate]
    Freezer: Freezers spew out a fast-hardening foam
 that immediately begins to harden. They are primar-
 ily used as a non-lethal method of immobilizing or
 securing a target. Struck characters must immediately
 make a REF x 3 Test or become trapped. Apply a –30
 modifier to this test if the attacker scored an Excel-
 lent Success (MoS 30+). The foam allows characters
 to breath even if their mouth and nose are covered,
 but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked
 with contact toxins or drugs to additionally sedate
 the target. It can also be used to construct temporary
 barricades or cover. Hardened foam has an Armor of
 10 and Durability of 20. It slowly breaks down and
 degrades over a 12 hour period. Freezers are two-
 handed. [Moderate]
    Shard Pistol: The shard pistol is a flechette weapon,
 firing a stream of of diamondoid monomolecular
 shards at high velocities. These micro flechettes are
 very good at penetrating armor, but they do not dis-
 perse kinetic energy well and so do not cause as much
 tissue damage as kinetic weapons. Shard ammunition
 is often coated with drugs or toxins for extra effi-
 ciency. [Low]
    Shredder: A heavier version of the shard pistol,
 the shredder fires a larger cloud of lethal flechettes,
 enough to shred a portion of the target into a fine
 mist. [Moderate]

    ammunition capsules rather than fuel tanks, scorch-
    ing targets and setting them on fire. Any hit that is
    an Excellent Success (MoS 30+) sets the target on
    fire, where they will continue to take 2d10 damage
    per Action Turn. These chemical fires are particularly
    difficult to put out unless they are deprived of oxygen.
    Torches are two-handed. [Moderate]

    GRENADES AND SEEKERS
   Grenades and seeker missiles come in similar muni-
   tions packages and with similar trigger mechanisms,
   though their packaging, physical form, and methods
   of application differ. Seeker missiles are fired from a
    seeker launcher (p. 339) using Seeker Weapons skill.
   Grenades are thrown at targets using Throwing Weap-
   ons skill. If a grenade or seeker misses, use the rules
   for scatter (p. 204).
      Grenades are available in standard form or as
   microgrenades. Similarly, missiles are available in
    standard, minimissile, or micromissile sizes. Standard
    grenades and minimissiles are the baseline standard
   for listed effects. All are area effect weapons (p. 193).
   Minigrenades and micromissiles inflict –1d10 damage
   (or have another decreased effect as noted). Standard
   missiles double the listed DV. For weapons with a
   unfirom blast effect or other static blast area, divide
   the base listed radius in half for minigrenades and mi-
    cromissiles and double it for standard missiles. Listed
    costs are for 10 grenades/missiles.
      Each seeker has one smart ammo option (p. 338)
   other than biter or flayer.
      Concussion: These devices emit a concussive blast
   designed to knock opponents off their feet and stun
   them. Any character caught within a base blast radius
   of 10 meters must make a SOM x 2 Test. If they fail,
   they are knocked down. If their MoF is 30+, they are
   additionally stunned until the end of the next Action
   Turn. Anyone caught in the blast radius suffers a
   –10 action modifier for the rest of that Action Turn.

      EMP: EMP munitions fire off a strong electromag-
   netic pulse when they “detonate.” Since most electron-
   ics in Eclipse Phase are built with optical technology,

 shielded and surge-protected, this has no major
 damaging effect. Antennas, however, are vulnerable,
 especially finer wires like those used with mesh inserts.
 As a result, the primary effect of EMP is to disable
 radio communications—every radio within range of
 the blast is reduced to 1/10th the normal range. The
 base blast radius for EMP is 50 meters. [High]
    Frag: Fragmentation explosives spread a cloud of
 lethal flechettes over the area of effect. They are re-
 sisted with kinetic armor. [Moderate]
    Gas/Smoke: Gas/smoke munitions emit a cloud of
 their contained substance. Smoke impedes sight by
 releasing thick fumes upon ignition of the seeker. The
 smoke can be of any color and is often heated (called
 thermal smoke) to obfuscate heat signatures moving
 through the smoke as cover. Note that gases dissipate
 much more quickly under certain environmental con-
 ditions (wind, rain, etc.) [Low]
    High-Explosive: High-explosive seekers and gre-
 nades are designed to create a very destructive shock
 and heat wave. This damage is resisted with energy
 armor. [Moderate]
    High-Explosive Armor-Piercing (HEAP): A design
 only available for seekers (not grenades), HEAP
 warheads use high explosives to blast a path for
 a penetrating round. HEAPs lose –4 damage per
 meter distance from the blast, as opposed to the
 usual –2. [Moderate]
    Overload: Overload grenades and seekers launch an
 all-out assault on the target’s sensory spectrum. This
 attack includes blinding by intense flashing light, a
 deafening thunderclap followed by intense ultrasonic
 screaming, nausea-inducing malodorants, and infra-
 sonic frequencies that can trigger unpleasant emotion-
 al responses (anxiety, uneasiness, extreme sorrow, ner-
 vous feelings of revulsion or fear). For an extra kick,
 overloads are also packed with “stingballs”—rubber
 pellets that inflict pain when detonated near an under-
 armored target. Anyone caught in the base 10-meter
 blast radius must make a SOM + WIL Test. If they fail,
 they must immediately leave the area of effect. If they
 fail with an MoF of 30+, they are incapacitated for
 3 Action Turns with disorientation and/or vomiting,
 after which they must roll again. Overload munitions

   of effect suffers a –30 action modifier, which reduces
   by 10 per Action Turn after they leave the area. Ad-
   ditionally, anyone facing the direction of the overload
   round suffers a –10 glare modifier (neutralized by
   anti-glare systems). [Moderate]
      Plasmaburst: Also called “hellballs,” these muni-
   tions release a burst of plasma upon detonation that
   causes searing heat and fire damage across the area of
   effect without the devastating shockwaves of explo-
   sions that might rebound in an enclosed environment
   and/or breach a habitat’s infrastructure. [High]
      Splash: Splash rounds spread a contained substance
   (drug, chemical, nanoswarm, paint) over a base 10-
   meter blast radius when they detonate. [Low plus
   payload cost]
      Thermobaric: Thermobaric grenades and seekers
   utilize a more deadly form of explosion. When they
   detonate, they disperse a cloud of aerosol explosive
   over an area and then ignite, literally setting the air
   on fire, generating a devastating pressure wave, and
   sucking the oxygen out of the area. Thermobarics use
   the rules for uniform blast (p. 194). [High]

   STICKY GRENADES
   Sticky grenades have a special coating that when trig-
   gered becomes a sticky adhesive, allowing the grenade
   to be stuck to almost any surface. Sticky grenades can
   even be wielded in melee combat, smacking them on
   an opponent to be detonated later. [Trivial]

   EXOTIC RANGED WEAPONS
  These weapons are either rare or distinctly separate
  from other weapons types. These weapons are wielded
  with an Exotic Ranged Weapon skill of the appropri-
  ate field.
     Vortex Ring Gun: This less-lethal two-handed
  weapon detonates a blank cartridge and accelerates
  the explosive pressure down a widening barrel so that
  it develops into a high-speed vortex ring—a spinning,
  donut-shaped blast vortex. This concussive blast is
  used to knock down and incapacitate close-range
  targets. Struck targets suffer a –10 action modifier for
  the rest of that Action Turn and must must succeed in

WEAPON ACCESSORIES
The following accessories are available for various
weapons.
   Arm Slide: This slide-mount can hold a pistol-
sized weapon under a character’s sleeve, pushing the
weapon into the character’s hand with an electronic
signal or specific sequence of arm movements. [Low]
   Extended Magazine: This ammunition case has
an increased capacity. Increase the weapon’s ammo
capacity by +50%. Only available for firearms and
seekers. [Low]
   Gyromount: This weapon harness features a gyro-
stabilized weapon mount that keeps the weapon steady.
Negates all modifiers from movement. [Moderate]
   Imaging Scope: Imaging scopes attach to the top of
the weapon and act like specs (p. 325). Scopes may
also bend like a periscope, along a character to point
the weapon and target around corners without leav-
ing cover. [Low]
   Flash Suppressor: This device obscures the muzzle
flash on firearms, applying a –10 modifier on Percep-
tion Tests to locate a firing weapon by its flash. [Low]
   Laser Sight: This underbarrel laser emits a beam
that places a glowing red dot on the target to assist
targeting. Apply a +10 modifier to Attack Tests (not
cumulative with a smartlink modifier). Laser sights
may also be used to paint a target for laser-guided
smart ammo or seekers. Infrared and ultraviolet lasers
are also available, so that the dot is only visible to
characters able to see in those spectrums. [Low]
   Safety System: A biometric (palmprint or voice-
print) or ego ID (p. 279) sensor is embedded in the
weapon, disabling it if anyone other than an autho-
rized user attempts to fire it. [Low]
   Shock Safety: Just like a safety system, except that
an unauthorized user is zapped with an electric shock.
Treat as a shock baton (p. 334). [Moderate]
   Silencer/Sound Suppressor: This barrel-mounted
accessory reduces the sound of a firearm’s discharge.
Apply a –10 modifier on hearing-based Perception
Tests to hear or locate the gun’s firing. [Moderate]
   Smartlink: A smartlink system connects the weapon
to the user’s mesh inserts, placing a targeting bracket
in the character’s field of vision and providing range
and targeting information. Apply a +10 modifier to
the Attack Test. Smartlinks also incorporate a micro-
camera that allows the user to see what the weapon
is pointed at, fire around corners, etc. Smartlinks also
allow certain other types of weapon system control,
such as changing flux ammo (p. 337) or programming
seeker trigger conditions (p. 199). [Moderate]
   Smart Magazine: A smart magazine allows the
character to pick and choose what ammo round will
be fired with each shot. This system leaves less room
for bullets, however, so reduce the weapon’s ammu-
nition capacity by half (round up). Smart magazines
may be combined with extended magazines, in which
case ammo capacity is normal. [Moderate]

  ROBOTS AND VEHICLES
 The following is a small selection of the many vehicles
 in use in the solar system. Almost all of the vehicles
 in current use, including all of the vehicles listed here,
 have built-in AIs capable of piloting the vehicle under
 almost all circumstances. In most cases, passengers
 simply state their destination and the vehicle takes
 them there. Manual piloting is primarily used in
 emergencies or by people who prefer the exotic thrill
 of controlling their own vehicle.
   Rules for handling robots and vehicles are detailed
 on p. 195. Any of these shells may be modified for use
 as a synthetic morph by adding a cyberbrain system
 (p. 300). Each of the shells listed here comes with a
 puppet sock (p. 307) for remote-control operation.

  AIRCRAFT
 On Mars, Venus, and within large open-space habitats
 like O’Neil cylinders, aircraft of various kinds see regular
 use. This includes modern version of rotorcraft (helicop-
 ters, autogyros, tilt-rotors), fixed-wing planes, and zep-
 pelins and other lighter-than-air craft. These are typically
 propelled by turbofan or jet engines, rotors, or vectored
 thrust. These vehicles are piloted with Pilot: Aircraft skill.
    Microlight: This ultra-light personal aircraft is
 not much more than a strut-based wing, an airframe,
 and an electric propeller engine. They are ideal for
 getting around inside large habitats with enclosed
 airspace. [Low]
    Portable Plane: Powered by superconducting bat-
 teries and with an exceedingly small but powerful
 electric motor, this light but durable propeller plane
 is made of smart materials that allow it to be swiftly
 folded up into a small portable package. Different ver-
 sions are designed for flight on Mars, Titan, or Venus,
 each taking 10 minutes to assemble or disassemble.
 The Martian version unpacks into an airplane with a
 wingspan of 11 m with a top speed of 250 kph and a
 cruising speed of 220 kph and a range of 1,300 km.
 The Venusian version has a wingspan of 9 m, a top
 speed of 200 kph and a range of 1,000 km. The ver-
 sion designed for use on Titan has a wingspan of 8
 m and has a top speed of 200 kph and a range of
 2,000 km. In all versions, the two occupants ride in
 an inflatable and insulated pressurized bubble with a
 life support system capable of providing clean air and
 comfortable temperatures for 20 hours on Mars and
 Venus, and 15 hours on Titan. [High]

      Rocket Buggy: This vehicle is the most common
   form of medium to long distance personal transport
   on Luna, and is in common on most other moons
   and large asteroids. On these airless worlds, a rocket
   buggy can reach orbit and return or take a parabolic
   path to any destination on that moon in less than
   an hour. This vehicle is also regularly used to travel
   between habitats that are less than 30,000 km apart.
   The vehicle is pressurized, but is designed for short
   duration travel only. The seats are relatively small
   and the life support system contains no provisions
   for recycling food or water and can only support the
   passengers for an absolute maximum of 50 uncom-
   fortable hours. Rockets buggies come equipped with
   headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of
   up to 250 km.
     A version of this vehicle is also used on both Mars
   and Titan, but here the frame has been modified to
   act as a lifting body, and it has a top speed in the thin
   Martian atmosphere of 2,500 km/hour and a range
   of 8,000 km on Mars. On Titan is has a top speed
   of 3,000 kph in the atmosphere, but it can also reach
   orbit. [Expensive]
      Small Jet: Methane-powered jet planes are one of
   the most common forms of fast transport on Mars
   and Venus. Similar planes are used on Titan, except
   that they carry both liquid methane and liquid oxygen.
   These jets range in size from huge vehicles the size of
   late 20th-century airliners to small planes designed to
   carry half a dozen passengers. All jets are made using
   smart materials, so that their wings and frames can
   adapt to a wide range of speeds and altitudes. One
   common small jet has similar versions in use on Venus,
   Mars, and Titan, has a single jet engine and has a life
   support system capable of providing air for up to 100
   hours. The Venusian and Martian versions both have
   a top speed of 900 kph, a wingspan of 11 m, and a
   maximum range of 5,000 km. The version designed
   for Titan has a wingspan of 8 m, a top speed of 650
   kph, and a range of 4,000 km. Jets are equipped with
   headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of
   up to 250 km. [Expensive]

   EXOSKELETONS
   Exoskeletons are powered mechatronic skeleton
   frameworks worn by a person. Servo-hydraulic joints
   allow the exoskeleton to be maneuvered by mimick-
   ing the wearer’s own movements, as well as enhanc-
   ing their strength. Exoskeletons may also be piloted

electronically. A character wearing an exoskeleton
(other than the trike or transporter) maneuvers as
normal, because the exoskeleton is like an extension
of their own body. A character jamming an exoskel-
eton remotely uses Pilot: Walker skill (except for the
trike and transporter).
   Battle Suit: The battle suit powered exoskel-
eton features a military-grade fullerene armor shell
with flexible aerogel for thermal insulation and a
diamond-hardened exterior designed to resist even
potent ballistic and energy-based weapons. The suit
also enhances the wearer’s strength and mobility, ap-
plying a +10 bonus to strength-based tests, inflicting
an extra +1d10 damage and AP of –2 on melee at-
tacks, and doubling the distance by which the char-
acter may jump. Battlesuits are completely sealed to
protect the wearer from environmental factors, and
fitted with life support features and a maker (p. 327)
capable of recycling all wastes and producing air
for up to 48 hours and food and water indefinitely.
Battle suits are equipped with each an ecto (p. 325),
a radio booster (p. 313), and sensors equal to specs
(see p. 325). These suits have an Armor Value of
18/18 (not cumulative with any other armor) and
protect the wearer from temperatures from –175 to
140 C. [Expensive]
   Exowalker: Exowalkers are minimal framework
exoskeletons, primarily designed to bolster the
wearer’s strength and movement. They provide a an
Armor Value of 2/4, a +10 modifier to strength-based
tests, and double the distance by which the character
may jump. [Moderate]
   Hyperdense Exoskeleton: These powered exoskel-
etons are larger (roughly twice human-sized) and built
for heavy-use industrial purposes, such as handling
heavy/large objects. The wearer is partially encapsulated
to protect them from debris and industrial accidents.
Hyperdense exoskeletons provide no movement bonus,
but provide a +30 bonus to strength-based tests and
inflict an extra +3d10 damage and –5 AP on physical
attacks. They have an Armor Value of 6/12. [Expensive]
   Transporter: This exoskeleton framework includes
a pair of vector-thrust turbofan engines, giving the
user flight capabilities in gravity and increased maneu-
verability in zero-G. It provides partial protection to
the wearer with an Armor Value of 2/4. Piloted with
Pilot: Aircraft skill. [High]

  skill. [Moderate]

  GROUNDCRAFT
  In Eclipse Phase, trains and bicycles remain the most
  common form of ground transportation, especially on
  habitats. In larger habitats and on moons and planets,
  cycles and cars are used as well.
     Cycle: Because of the high cost of enclosing a habi-
  tat and providing life support, space is at a premium
  in all cities except some of the newest cities on Mars.
  As a result, there is rarely room for large roads or the
  cars that once carpeted the roads of Earthly cities.
  Instead, the ubiquitous modern vehicle is the cycle,
  which is designed to drive down narrow streets only a
  little wider than sidewalks in Earth cities.
     There are many different varieties of cycle. Some
  have only a single wheel and are gyro-stabilized, but
  most have two wheels and resemble old Earth motor-
  cycles. In some, the driver and passenger are enclosed
  by a streamlined pod. These vehicles are powered
  by superconducting batteries, have a range of 600
  km and a top speed of 120 kph, but must usually
  drive more slowly in crowded streets. Cycles are all
  equipped with radio boosters, headlights, and a por-
  table radar sensor. Tires are solid state (not inflated),
  or in some cases smart spokes capable of handling
  stairs. Some luxury versions have limited life-support
  in the small cabin, capable of providing air for the
  passengers for up to 10 hours. [Moderate]
     Mars Buggy: One of the most ubiquitous vehicles
  on Mars is the so-called Mars buggy, a four-wheeled
  vehicle with large balloon tires that is designed for
  use both on roads and on almost any terrain. Mars
  buggies can travel at speed of up to 110 kph on roads,
  90 kph over relatively flat terrain, and up to 40 kph
  on jagged and rocky terrain. They can maintain these
  speeds because smart materials in both the suspension
  and the tires reshape themselves to adapt to uneven
  conditions and their nuclear batteries give them an
  effectively unlimited range. Most Mars buggies are
  enclosed but unpressurized. Similar vehicles are used
  on Luna and Titan, however, though the passenger
  compartments of these vehicles includes life support

 gear that provides the occupants with air for at least
 100 hours. Buggies are powered by nuclear batteries
 and come in a variety of sizes, from small two-person
 buggies to large trucks. Mars buggies come equipped
 with headlights, radio boosters, and a vehicle radar
 system. [High]

 PERSONAL VEHICLES
 These one-person movement aids primarily are used in
 space, but do not count as spacecraft per se.
   EVA Sled: This small sled uses air impellers to maneu-
 ver in zero-G. It is commonly used to carry attached gear,
 but may also pull along 1 human-sized morph. [Low]
   Rocket Pack: This is a miniature metallic hydrogen
 rocket that the wearer straps to their back, with two
 rocket exhausts extending out to either side, away
 from the wearer’s body or legs. Biomorphs and pod
 morphs can only safely use this vehicle when wear-
 ing a vacuum suit or some garment that is similarly
 heat resistant. Also, to prevent harm to the wearer, the
 thrust must be kept sufficiently low that it can only
 take off on Mars or moons with even lower gravity. A
 rocket pack can keep the wearer airborne for up to 15
 minutes in Mars gravity, or 30 minutes on Luna, Titan,
 or any of the four large Jovian moons. On Mars, it
 has a maximum speed of 700 kph. It can be used to
 reach orbit and land again on Luna, Titan, and other
 similarly small bodies like the Jovian moons. Rocket
 packs are equipped with radio boosters but no other
 sensors or communication devices. [Low]
   Thruster Pack: Worn for EVA duties, this thruster
 pack uses vectored thrust nozzles, allowing a charac-
 ter to maneuver in open space. This is not a jetpack
 and does not produce enough thrust for atmospheric
 movement. [Low]

 ROBOTS
 Robots are a common sight and accepted fact of daily
 life within Eclipse Phase. Numerous varieties exist,
 from robo-pets to mechanical workers to warbots.
 If a job can be done more cheaply (and sometimes
 safely) by a bot, it usually is. The robots listed here
 are not generally used as synthetic shells by transhu-

   they are not equipped to be sleeved into (though the
   may be jammed; see p. 196). Any of these bots may
   be modified for use as a synthetic morph, however, by
   adding a cyberbrain system (p. 300).
      Automech: Automechs are general purpose repair
   drones, found just about everywhere. Each particular
   automech tends to specialize in a particular type of
   repair work and so carries the appropriate tools and
   AI skills, whether it be habitat waste recyclers, outer
   hull integrity, or servitor systems. Standard automechs
   are wheeled cubes with articulated limbs, though they
   are also equipped with vectored-thrust drives for
   zero-G work. [Moderate]
      Creepy: Creepies are small crawler bots that come
   in an eclectic variety of shapes and forms, from robo-
   squirrels to insectoids to bizarre and artsy mechanical
   creatures. Creepies were originally designed as a sort of
   robotic pet, but they are commonly used as a general
   purpose household minion, like a more beloved servi-
   tor. Many people in fact wear a creepy on their person,
   dropping it to handle small tasks for them and letting it
   crawl up and down and over their body. [Low]
      Dr. Bot: These wheeled medical robots are designed
   to tend to and transport injured or sick people. They
   carry a healing vat (p. 326), a specialized pharmaceu-
   ticals maker, miscellaneous medical gear, and articu-
   lated arms for conducting remote surgery. [Moderate]
      Dwarf: These large industrial bots are named not
   just for their primary use—mining, excavation, tun-
   neling, and construction—but because the default
   AIs they shipped with had a programmed tendency
   to happily whistle as they worked. Dwarfs are quad-
   rapedal walkers, equipped with massive modular
   industrial tools like boring drills, shovels, hydraulic
   jacks, jackhammers, scooping arms, acid sprays, and
   so on. [Expensive]
      Gnat: Gnats are small rotorcraft camera/surveil-
   lance drones. Many people use gnats for personal
   lifelogging, while socialites and media use them to
   capture the glamor or hottest news. [Low]
      Guardian Angel: Similar to gnats, guardian angel ro-
   torcraft hover around their charges, keeping a watch-
   ful eye out to protect them from threats. [Moderate]
      Saucer: These disc-shaped drones are lightweight
   and quiet. They are typically launched by throwing

 them like a frisbee, after which they propel themselves
 with an ionic drive (p. 310). Saucers make excellent
“eye in the sky” monitors and scouts. [Low]
    Servitor: Servitors are the most common robot,
 acting as cooks, janitors, universal helpers, movers,
 and personal aides. Every home has one, if not several.
 Servitors are intentionally built in non-humanoid
 forms so as not to confuse them with common
 synthmorphs and in order to defuse bad feelings at
 ordering them around. However, they all have some
 form of “face” to interact with, so as not to be too
 machine-like. [Low]
    Speck: Specks are tiny insectoid spy drones, 2.5 mm
 long and 2 mm wide, about the size of a small fruit fly.
They fly with tiny wings, carry a microbug, and are
 excellent for surveillance purposes or otherwise being
 a “speck on a wall.” Specks are difficult to notice (–30
 Perception modifier) and almost impossible to distin-
 guish from an actual insect. [Low]

 SPACECRAFT
 Though egocasting is a common method of personal
 transport and it’s often easier to simply transmit the
 specifications for various goods and to allow nano-
 factories to create duplicates, spacecraft play an
 important role in the solar system, carrying both pas-
 sengers and valuable cargo. Both in terms of materials
 and propulsion, spacecraft in the post-Fall era are far
 superior to the primitive vessels used in the 20th and
 early 21st centuries, but they are still based on the
 same principles.

      Spacecraft have few stats in Eclipse Phase, as they
    are primarily handled as setting rather than vehicles.
    Note also that no stats are given for spacecraft weap-
    onry. It is highly recommended that space combat be
    handled as a plot device rather than a combat scene,
    given the extreme lethality and danger involved.

If you absolutely must know the DV of a spacecraft
weapon, treat it as a a standard weapon with a DV
multiplier of x3 for small craft (fighters and shuttles),
x5 for medium craft, and x10 for larger craft.

SPACECRAFT PROPULSION
The most important part of any spacecraft is its engine,
and the most important features of any engine are
the exhaust velocity, which determines how much
fuel the rocket requires to reach a given speed, and
the engine’s thrust, which determines how high the
acceleration can be. Any rocket that has a thrust of
less than approximately twice the gravity of a planet
or moon cannot take off from that planet or moon.
Sample thrusts and gravities are listed on the Escaping
Gravity Wells table, p. 346.
   Hydrogen-Oxygen Rocket (HO): Though opti-
mized with improved engine design and light-weight
materials, these are essentially the same primitive
rockets that humanity used to first reach the moon
in the 20th century. These are rarely used and only
common with groups too poor or primitive to safely
manufacture metallic hydrogen.
   Metallic Hydrogen Rocket (MH): Metallic hydro-
gen is a solid form of hydrogen created using exceed-
ingly high pressures. Although naturally unstable, it
can be stabilized with carefully controlled electrical
and magnetic fields, and these field generators are
an integral part of every metallic hydrogen fuel tank.
By selectively reducing these fields near the exhaust
nozzle, small amounts of metallic hydrogen can be
made to swiftly and explosively revert to conventional
hydrogen gas, propelling the rocket with great force

in an easily controlled fashion. Metallic hydrogen
engines are used in most planetary landers and short
range vehicles.
   Plasma Rocket (P): This drive heats hydrogen into
plasma and accelerates it using a powerful electrical
field. This type of rocket was very common in the
mid 21st century, but has been superseded by fusion
rockets and is only used in older and more primitive
spacecraft, notably scum barges.
   Fusion Rocket (F): Similar to a plasma rockets,
fusion rockets require significantly higher tempera-
tures and pressures, and the rocket also produces
large amounts of power for the spacecraft. Fusion
rockets are now the most common form of propul-
sion for spacecraft designed for long-distance voyages.
   Anti-Matter Rocket (AM): Anti-matter rockets
work mixing small amounts of anti-matter into the
hydrogen fuel, producing enormous amounts of
energy and an exceptionally fast and powerful ex-
haust. These rockets typically carry a heavily shielded
magnetically contained anti-matter storage vessel car-
rying a mass of anti-matter equal to 1% of the mass
of the hydrogen fuel used by the rocket. The magnetic
containment vessels needed to safely contain anti-
matter usually weight at least 10 times the mass of
the antimatter used.
   Though anti-matter storage is exceptionally safe,
the vast energy release possible if there was an ac-
cident means that anti-matter rockets are forbid-
den from coming closer than 25,000 km from any
inhabited planet or moon. Also, very few habitats
will allow an anti-matter rocket to dock with them,
and instead require the spacecraft to remain at least
10,000 km away and for all cargo and passengers to
be transferred using a small craft like a small LOTV.
Anti-matter is exceedingly expensive to produce and
so anti-matter rockets are only used in military vessels
and in fast couriers designed to carry critical cargoes
across the solar system in short periods of time.

SAMPLE SPACECRAFT
The following is a representative sample of the most
common type of spacecraft used in the solar system today.
   Bulk Carrier: This vessel is simply a standard
transport refitted to carry large amounts of cargo in
external cargo grapples. Used for carrying refined ores,
ice, and similar forms of large, useful, but low priority
cargos, bulk carriers transport large cargos at rela-
tively low velocities. They also offer an inexpensive,
reliable, and slow method for passengers to travel
from one habitat to another and are not infrequently
used by individuals who wish to disappear for a while.
Unlike the standard transport, the bulk carrier lacks
the rotating habitat pods.
   Courier: In a standard transport, a typical journey
from Luna to Mars requires approximately three
weeks, while a journey from Mars to Jupiter requires
approximately four months. This is sufficient for most
purposes, but occasionally characters need to take
themselves or sufficiently valuable cargoes across the

%%% txt/350.txt
 solar system in a matter of days or weeks, instead of
 weeks or months.
    Anti-matter drive fast couriers are vessels de-
 signed for this specific purpose. This vessel can
 travel from Venus to Mars in a week and from
 Mars to Jupiter in a month. The fast courier is the
 swiftest vessels currently made and is able to reach
 at much as one half of one percent of the speed
 of light. To manage this, this spacecraft must also
 carry 6 tons of antimatter in a 100 ton magnetic
 containment vessel. In an emergency, this contain-
 ment facility can be jettisoned.
    Destroyer: One of the largest military spacecraft
 in common use, destroyers use an antimatter drive
 holding 150 tons of antimatter in a 2,000-ton mag-
 netic containment vessel. This antimatter can also
 be used to provide the spacecraft’s missiles with
 anti-matter for devastatingly powerful anti-matter
 warheads. This spacecraft is also armed with
 railguns, nuclear and high explosive missiles, and
 point defense lasers.  In addition, all destroyers
 carry a contingent of 20 fighters.
    Fighter: This small, short range military vessel is de-
 signed to be crewed by an infomorph or AI. If needed,
 however, it can hold a single synthmorph or vaccum-
 adapted biomorph as a pilot. It carries 3 lasers and 2
 railguns mounted on small pods placed around the
 middle of ship that can fire in any direction. A single
 missile launcher is located in the nose of the fighter
 and typically holds 6 small high explosive missiles or
 tactical nuclear missiles (or even anti-matter missiles
 if facing high-threat targets).
    General Exploration Vehicle (GEV): A GEV is one
 of the standard vehicles used for exploration beyond
 the Pandora Gates. It is specifically designed to handle
 almost any environment. It is a boxy vehicle, 6 meters
 long, 2.2 meters wide, and 2 meters high. It makes
 extensive use of smart matter in the lower part of the
 chassis, and can create wheels or short legs (primar-
 ily useful for exceedingly rough terrain). It can even
 produce limited hull streamlining and propulsion

 tion, it contains a small metallic hydrogen engine that
 allow it to maneuver in space with an acceleration of
 up to 0.1 G. GEVs have a Maximum Velocity of 200
 (wheeled)/40 (walker)/60 (sea)/40 (submerged).
    The GEV also has a closed cycle life support system
 that can support up to 6 (fairly cramped) living
 occupants for up to one month and limited electro-
 magnetic shielding against charged particle radiation.
 All models are fitted with advanced AI piloting and
 navigation as well as limited self-repair capacity. In
 addition, GEV’s have an extensible airlock, a single
 healing vat, several desktop CMs, and a variety of
 sensors, including both radar and telescopic full spec-
 trum cameras.
    Large Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (LLOTV):
 This common vehicle is used for transporting passen-
 gers and cargo between a planet or moon and orbit
 and for short distance transfers between habitats
 less than 100,000 km apart. This conical vehicle has
 a curved heat shield on the base and smart material
 landing legs and grapples so that it can rest securely
 on any stable terrain and link up with all forms of
 docking clamps. It comes in variants designed to use
 either a hydrogen-oxygen chemical rocket or a me-
 tallic hydrogen rocket. The use of light-weight smart
 materials allows the interior to be easily and rapidly
 reconfigured to accommodate different amounts of
 fuel, passenger seats, and cargo space. LLOTVs that
 are not designed for planetary landing or which are
 designed only to land on airless moons are unstream-
 lined and look considerably blockier.
    LLOTVs come in two configurations: high or low
 velocity. High velocity configuration allows the vehicle
 to land and take off again on Venus or Earth without
 refueling and for rapid transport between nearby
 habitats. Low velocity configuration is designed to
 land and take off again on Mars or various large
 moons without refueling and for slower and more
 fuel efficient transport between nearby habitats. The
 extensive use of smart materials in this vehicle means

that LLOTVs that use metallic hydrogen engines can
be easily converted between the high and low velocity
configurations, requiring less than a day in a well-
equipped maintenance facility. However, vessels using
hydrogen oxygen engines cannot be converted. Since
metallic hydrogen is a much more efficient propellant,
landers using it always include significant amounts of
extra propellant for emergencies.
   Scum Barge: These huge craft were originally de-
signed for use during the first stages of the evacuation
of Earth. They were built to carry up to 20,000 people
and to allow them to survive for months or even years,
in relatively cramped conditions, until more suitable
habitats could be constructed. A number of these ves-
sels are still in service, primarily used as mobile habi-
tats by various anarchic subcultures. The best have
had their plasma rockets replaced by modern fusion
rockets and carry 5-10,000 in relative comfort. The
worst use aging plasma rockets and stretch their life
support systems and living spaces to the limit, carry-
ing up to 25,000 poor and desperate residents.
   Small Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (SLOTV):
This vehicle is identical in use and design to the
LLOTV, except that it is one third the total mass and
correspondingly less expensive to build and refuel.
Some exceptionally wealthy individuals own private
small LOTVs. Using a small LOTV with a hydrogen-
oxygen engine to take off and land on Venus or for
other high velocity uses is exceptionally cramped
and allows for absolutely no room for error. Like the
LLOTV, this vehicle can be easily converted between
low and high velocity configurations and is made in
both streamlined and non-streamlined versions.
   Standard Transport: This vessel is one of the most
common freighter and passenger vessel in the solar
system. While egocasting is by far the most common
form of inter-habitat transport, some people prefer to
travel by ship and others do not wish to leave their
current morph behind. In addition, some goods are
easier or cheaper to physically transport rather than
duplicating their templates. As a result, standard
transports regularly travel to and from every large
habitat and inhabited planet and moon in the solar
system. These are modern fusion-drive ships that offer
fast and comfortable travel for passengers as well as
relatively swift transport for small cargoes.
   One of the additional benefits of the standard
transport is the fact that it contains four separate pas-
senger compartments, each of which is mounted on
a 90 meter-long booms that can extend and rotate
to simulate gravity. When rotating at a comfortable 2
rpm, passengers experience Mars level gravity. Typi-
cally, the gravity maintained in these pods starts at
the local gravity (or Mars gravity, if the local gravity
is higher) and over the course of the journey gradually
increases or decreases to the gravity of the destination.
However, these pods cannot rotate to produce gravity
higher than that found on Mars.

 If you’re a player and not a gamemaster, we strong
 secrets and other information that can ruin your enjoy
 it. Ok, maybe you’re obsessive and you want to know
 after all. But really, do you read the last chapter of a
 the punchline before hearing the joke? Do you wait
 full spoilers before you go see it? Ok, maybe you do,
 in mind that some of the things here may change yo

 spoiler alerts.



    This chapter provides a wealth of information and
  tools that gamemaster will find useful for running
  Eclipse Phase campaigns.



  SECRETS THAT MATTER
  There are secrets woven all through the real history of
  the 21st century, and the present, and therefore all pros-
  pects for the future. These are the pieces of information
  that never make it into a habitat’s mesh at all. Some of
  it is unknown to transhumanity. Some is known only
  to a select few transhumans who carefully ensure that
  it does not leak out of their control. Some is known to
  wider conspiracies, such as Firewall, but is kept out of
  the public eye for reasons of security and safety. These
  secrets can be dangerous to those who know them.
  Those who have stumbled across them have died for
  their knowledge, have erased their own memories (or
  had them erased by others), or have hidden themselves
  someplace other people never go, to avoid dealing with
  the consequences of such knowledge.
     The information provided in this section is available
  for characters to discover and, one way or another,
  to confront them, giving gamemasters the tools they
  need to provide their players with fresh challenges and
  opportunities. Every secret contains the possibility of
  great reward and of greater trouble, usually bundled
  together. Nothing here was just forgotten or lost out
  of carelessness. It was hidden by someone who wanted
  to keep it away from someone (or everyone) else.
  Every secret the characters learn inserts them into a
  new web of other people’s complications—a potential
  source for drama and conflict in your campaign.

  EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCES

  to be 13.2 billion years old—almost as old as the

   homo sapiens humans evolved approximately a mere
   400,000 years ago. Against the backdrop of the ga-
   lactic calendar, transhumans are nascent arrivals on
   the scene; newborns in every sense of the word. More
   importantly, transhumans are uninvited guests in what
   other, older intelligences think of as their assets.
         For years, humans scientists have struggled with
   the Fermi Paradox, which questions why no evidence
   of alien life has yet been found—such as spacecraft,
   transmissions or probes—despite the mathematical
   likelihood that a multitude of advanced extraterrestrial
   civilizations should exist in the Milky Way. One postu-
   lation says that there must be some sort of unknown
  “Great Filter”—an event that all intelligence encounters
   in its development that for whatever reason such life
   cannot surpass. In other words, an extinction event.
   Some worried that the development of dangerous
   technologies—nuclear weapons, nanotechnology, etc.—
   before a civilization had matured could be the Great
   Filter. Others worried that it could be a technological
   singularity event, such as the TITANs and the Fall.
         In fact, alien races do exist, and they have been
   around for far, far longer than transhumanity. New
   ones, however, are simply rare, as few have managed
   to elude destruction at the hands of the ETI.
         The ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) is the civi-
   lization that dominates galactic life in Eclipse Phase.
  The ETI is incredibly old and powerful—a Type III or
   even Type IV civilization on the Kardashev scale. It is
   capable of megascale engineering projects and enjoys
   an understanding of physics, matter, energy, and uni-
   versal laws that makes all of transhuman knowledge
   seem insignificant in comparison. Most likely, the ETI
   itself evolved from some sort of artificial intelligence
   singularity event in its own past, ascending to a god-
   like level of super-intelligence. It may no longer be
   recognizably biological.
         This ETI has seeded the galaxy with a type of
   self-replicating probes known as bracewell probes.

THE ETI AGENDA
The nature of the ETI and its agenda is one of the
great mysteries of Eclipse Phase. This potent alien
civilization has had a direct hand in manipulating
transhumanity’s existence and future, yet it is likely
that characters in this game will never encounter
these entities directly or discover the meaning
behind what they have done. As transhumanity
expands outwards into the galaxy, however, it is
possible and even likely that they will find other
evidence of the ETI’s activities and inﬂuence, un-
doubtedly raising even more questions.
  Ultimately the ETI’s nature and goals are in the
gamemaster’s hands. There are many possibilities
to be explored, and some may fit the intentions of
your gaming group more than others. A few pos-
sible scenarios and explanations are noted below,
but gamemasters are encouraged to develop their
own variations.

SECURITY
In this scenario, the ETI’s intent is to maintain its
dominant position as the most intelligent and
powerful entity in its light cone. It uses the Exsur-
gent virus to wipe out any emerging singularities—
and the civilizations that spawned them—merely
to protect its own self-interest. Though mere
transhumans are a trifling nuisance, anything
resembling a self-improving super-intelligence is
targeted for annihilation.

THE AGGRESSION FILTER
The ETI does not seek to wipe out emerging intel-
ligences, but it does act as an evolutionary force.
In this case, the Exsurgent virus is used as a tool
to neutralize any aggressive, hyper-evolving forms
of intelligent life, thus encouraging the evolution
of more careful, subtle, slow-growing, observant,
and exploratory species. In other words, the ETI
seeks to weed out traits that could be considered
dangerous or threatening, acting as a sort of ga-
lactic domestication program.




These probes lie dormant in every star system, pa-
tiently waiting and monitoring for millennia for signs
of intelligent life—but not just any signs. In particular,
these probes are designed to watch for signs of emerg-
ing singularity-level machine intelligence. The probes
are in fact traps, designed to lure such seed AI intel-
ligences in and then infect them.
     The reason for this infection remains unknown
(see The ETI Agenda), but it is a pattern that has
played itself out around the galaxy with uncounted
alien civilizations. New life evolves, creates technol-
ogy, develops something akin to seed AI, and then
bam!—the seed AIs find the probes, become infected,
DIVERSITY
he ETI is vast, super-intelligent, and god-like,
o the point where dealing with lesser minds is
elow its interest. It does, however, benefit from
 ien perspectives that evolved independently
nd have their own unique viewpoints, modes of
onsciousness, and ways of thinking/doing things.
y absorbing these civilizations, the ETI grows and
volves its own perspectives. In the process, how-
ver, such emerging civilizations are assimilated
nd/or wiped out.

 NLIGHTENMENT
he Exsurgent virus endows a greater understand-
 g of the universe (from the ETI’s point of view)
n singularity-level seed AIs. Only these emerg-
 g super-intelligences have the perceptual and
rocessing capabilities to understand the various
 ientific and philosophical revelations the ETI
mbodies. The TITANs weren’t corrupted or driven
 sane, they simply logically concluded that their
est course of action was to immediately upload
s many minds as possible by force and then to
 ove on to bigger and greater tasks.

WAR REMNANTS
he history of the Milky Way galaxy does not
 st hold one ETI, but two. In this version, the
xsurgent virus is actually a weapon, a remnant
f a war between two post-singularity god-like
 telligences. The virus is supposed to trigger self-
estruction of an emerging singularity, but either
 was imperfect or the TITANS somehow survived
 erhaps thanks to the Prometheans). Either
 ay, the TITANs left our system in search of one
f these ETIs, following a trail of clues that only
hey understood. They left the wormhole gateway
ehind as an open invitation for transhumanity to
ollow in their wake, though they didn’t bother
 aiting around or helping us along—we simply
 eren’t worth the effort.                        ■



   and turn against their creators. Most civilizations
   do not survive, as evidenced by the Iktomi (p. 377).
   Others do, such as the Factors (p. 373), but they
   remain forever changed by the experience.
        It was one of these ETI probes that begins our
   story, traveling to the Sol system some uncounted
   millions—if not billions—of years ago, where it set its
   trap and patiently began to wait.

   THE FIRST SEED AIS
   Fast forward to Earth, where a species of evolved pri-
   mates has created a technological civilization. As their
   technologies advance at an unprecedented rate, these

%%% txt/356.txt
humans gain the ability to modify themselves, defeat
death, nanofabricate, uplift other species to sapience,
and even to create artificial digital life.
     Unknown to most of transhumanity, the TITANs
were not the first seed AIs. A group of pro-AI re-
searchers known as the Singularity Foundation (that
would later join with other groups to form Firewall in
the wake of the Fall) developed the first true seed AIs
years before the Fall. Having been heavily involved in
the creation of AI and AGIs for many years previously,
thanks in large part to their open source AI frame-
work software, the Singularity Foundation’s goal was
to generate “friendly AI” by carefully designing AI
goal systems.
     These first seed AIs, known as Prometheans
(p. 381), were created in secret. Their progression
towards super-intelligence was more of a soft take-
off, increasing upwards in gradual increments. The
Singularity researchers hoped that these friendly AIs
would help counter the threat of any unfriendly AI
that developed, and so they were quietly nurtured in
secret labs, slowly but surely escalating in abilities.

THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE TITANS
The TITANs (Total Information Tactical Awareness
Networks) were a military netwar system brought
on-line by the United States Department of Defense.
One of the last major expenditures of this declining
nation, the TITANs were an advanced version of AGI
(artificial general intelligence) designed to be adaptive
and given self-improving capabilities to counteract
enemy network defenses.
      Contrary to public opinion, the TITANs did not
instigate the events that led to the Fall. In fact, only
a portion of the TITAN system was active before
the Fall, acting purely in a defensive capacity. When
hostilities broke out and a cascading chain of system
shocks engendered collapses and open conflicts, shak-
ing apart an already fragile societal structure, the full
extent of the TITAN systems were brought online.
Into this environment of conflict were the TITANs
born, their full capabilities unleashed, escalating into
a hard takeoff exponential growth towards super-
intelligence.
      The TITANs were careful at fi rst, and their
intentions were neither benevolent nor hostile, but
curious. As they improved and their self-awareness
swelled, the TITANs explored and gathered
knowledge, infiltrating human networks, following
humanity into space, and gaining an almost total
knowledge of human history and actions. These en-
tities also began secretly allocating resources (digital
and physical) for their own use, initiating “govern-
ment projects” that people assumed were legitimate
as they followed all proper protocols.

INFECTION
As the TITANs’ capacity for knowledge exceeded
that which humanity could provide them, they began
looking outward from Earth, searching for signs of
other intelligence. They did not need to look far. Their
enhanced intelligence capabilities allowed them to
notice certain clues—extremely subtle and intricate
puzzles—that something about the solar system was
artificial or had been manipulated by an intelligent
mind. Retasking several drones to investigate this phe-
nomenon, they found a buried device of apparent alien
origin. During the TITANs’ investigation and attempts
to access the device, they triggered and unleashed a
digital virus. Subtle, highly adaptive, and virulent, it
immediately began subsuming the TITANs, while
expanding its own knowledge of transhumanity.
     Later dubbed the Exsurgent virus by the Pro-
metheans, this virus transformed the TITANs and
coerced them towards its own will. Within a matter
of days the TITANs were reborn, reprogrammed with
a new purpose—a purpose that spelled doom for
transhumanity.

THE FALL
While history fully blames the TITANs for the
Fall, there are other factors that played their parts.
Human conflicts spurred the crisis, driven by global
inequalities in wealth and resources and an inability
to embrace emerging technologies in a mature and
enlightened manner. The TITANs, corrupted by alien
programming, stepped into this conflagration with
an unknown but devastating agenda. By the time
the presence and influence of the TITANs was fully
understood, there was little transhumanity could do
to stop them. Step by step, the TITANs increased their
intellect, power, and potential. They experimented
with new technologies and methodically took steps to
forcibly upload millions of human minds. Even when
the nature of the TITAN threat was fully understood,
transhuman factions refused to back down, continu-
ing to fight each other even as they each resisted the
TITANs. This refusal to stand united prevented tran-
shumanity from organizing a successful defense and
heightened our progress towards annihilation.
      Much of the devastation wrought to the Earth
and its populace—as well as on Mars, Luna, and in
space—was inflicted by transhumanity itself. Nuclear
strikes used against the TITANs killed millions and
ravaged an already weakened ecosphere. This dev-
astation was assisted by unfettered use of chemical
weapons. Biowar plagues and nanovirii tore through
vulnerable populations, indiscriminate in the deaths
and changes they inflicted. Bombs, missiles, orbital
mass drivers, and netwar attacks slew millions more
or destroyed critical infrastructure with just as lethal
consequences. These were crimes transhumans in-
flicted upon themselves.
      The TITANs played their role as well, of course,
unleashing AI-driven killing machines, unstoppable
self-replicating autonomous nanoswarms, computer
worms, and plagues of their own. They captured
entire cities in order to steal the minds of those within.
More insidiously, the Exsurgent virus did not con-
tain itself to infecting the TITANs. Infected TITANs

%%% txt/357.txt
created opportunities for the virus to spread among
multiple vectors: digital, biological, and nano. Using a
thorough understanding of transhuman biology and
its mental processes, derived from the looted vaults
of human knowledge, the virus was even applied
through a sensory input vector—the dreaded basilisk
hack (p. 364). Even more disturbing, however, was
what the virus did to those it infected, rewriting their
neural code to subvert them to its will and sometimes
physically transforming them into things that were
alien and monstrous.
     Ultimately, transhumanity lost this war, and the
survivors were forced to flee a planet that was already
ruined. Unknown to almost all, the Prometheans also
fought back against the TITANs. Through their ef-
forts, the Exsurgent virus was largely contained or at
least limited. Though the actions of the Prometheans
ultimately saved millions of lives—if not all of tran-
shumanity—in the end, they were also forced to fall
back and retreat, many of them having succumbed to
the Exsurgent virus or the TITANs.

AFTER THE FALL
Just when it seemed that transhumanity was on the
verge of extinction, the threat posed by the TITANs
suddenly diminished. They ceased waging active war-
fare and seemed to simply disappear. Though many of
their machines still prowled Earth, Luna, and Mars and
occasional outbreaks of nanovirii and other dangers
continued, to all intents and purposes they had simply
left. Many worried that they had quietly gone dormant,
or were secretly engaged on some major project that
would be the final blow against transhumanity. Others
voiced hope that they had somehow been defeated,
that they had fallen victim to some glitch or infighting.
With so many TITAN remnants making Earth a place
of great danger, however, no one was willing to risk
investigating too closely.
      Compounding the matter, a network of killsats was
laced in Earth orbit, enforcing an unvoiced interdiction
of Earth. No one claims responsibility for these satellite
defenses, though most suspect the Planetary Consor-
tium is responsible, despite their denials. Some think
that the killsats may have been a final measure put in
place by the TITANs, claiming Earth as theirs. No one
who knows the truth is saying. Most of transhumanity
was more than willing to embrace this quarantine of
their former homeworld, making it all the more easy to
forget the horrors that occurred there.
     It wasn’t until the first Pandora Gate was
discovered, shortly after the Fall, that many people
were finally willing to believe that the TITANs were
indeed gone. Though there is no direct evidence that
the TITANs are responsible for these gates, the timing
seems too coincidental. Furthermore, the discovery
of what are believed to be TITAN relics on certain
exoplanets fuels this theory.
     Why the TITANs left—and where they went—is
a mystery left to the gamemaster to explore. This ex-
planation might in fact serve as the focus for an entire
campaign as Firewall operatives are sent on the trail
of transhumanity’s elusive nemesis. The following are
a few sample concepts a gamemaster can use or build
on, as best fits their game:

 • The TITANs were in fact all destroyed, either
   due to infighting or by some mechanism of the
   Exsurgent virus.
 • The TITANs were actually beaten to a standstill
   by the Prometheans and retreated to recoup their
   forces … but they are marshaling their strength
   to return.
 • The TITANs left through the gates to find/join up
   with the ETI, leaving the gates behind so that tran-
   shumanity could follow when it was ready; perhaps
   to help, perhaps to finish the job of destruction.
 • The TITANs have been driven insane, either by
   the stress of accelerated intelligence growth or by
   the influence of the Exsurgent virus. Their actions
   are erratic, confused, and sometimes at odds with

%%% txt/358.txt
   each other. Though many TITANs have indeed
   left through the gates, they very well may return.
 • The TITANs are still around, simply well hidden.
   Outwardly they are dormant but inwardly they
   are engaged in a long period of circumspection
   and turmoil. Perhaps some of them are prepar-
   ing to ascend to another stage of intelligence, far
   beyond what even the TITANs are capable of. It
   is only a matter of time before this period ends
   and something gives.

FIREWALL
There cannot be another Fall—this is the mantra that
drives Firewall.
   Firewall is a secret, cross-faction organization dedi-
cated to safe-guarding transhumanity from existential
risks: aliens, weapons of mass destruction, hypercorp
experimentation, seed AIs, and so on. If anything
threatens transhumanity as a whole, Firewall is dedi-
cated to stopping that danger at any cost.
   The strength of Firewall rests in its members, known
as sentinels. Found in all factions and across all lo-
cales, sentinels are often diametrically opposed when
it comes to social, economic, and political ideologies,
to the point they might come to blows over their fer-
vent beliefs. Yet when the survival of transhumanity is
at stake, such extreme differences are set aside for the
greater good.

HISTORY
The origins of Firewall can be traced back to before
the Fall, to several key organizations: the Lifeboat In-
stitute, the JASONs, and the Singularity Foundation.
   A non-profit, non-governmental organization, the
Lifeboat Institute—founded in the opening years
of the 21st century—represented the first, concrete
attempts by citizens to recognize the dangers of un-
controlled technological development and to create
an international organization to safeguard humanity.
This institute developed several programs to research
and protect against so-called existential risks, from
asteroid strikes to pandemics—anything that might
wipe humanity out.
   The JASON Association, established in the mid
20th century, was an independent scientific advisory
board to the United States government. Though tied
to the MITRE Conglomerate—which, though a non-
profit organization, was still intrinsically linked to
the United States government—the scientists involved
with JASON were outside standard government over-
sight. Though they spurred numerous technological
developments for the government to deploy, they were
also one of the first internationally recognized groups
to predict global climate change. Prior to the Fall,
many members of the JASONs and their supporters
split away from the strict controls and reactionary
agendas of the hypercorps and various nation states
to form a new group, the Argonauts.
   The Singularity Foundation—formed at the dawn of
the 21st century—was dedicated to the creation of safe
artificial intelligence software, while raising awareness
of the benefits and dangers AIs represented. A fervent
believer in the singularity doctrine that technology
would move towards a single explosion of advance-
ments that would forever reshape humanity, the Singu-
larity Foundation was a strong advocate for creating
friendly AIs that would help protect humanity from an
uncontrolled, dangerous singularity event. This group
was significant in that it secretly succeeded in creating
a group of friendly seed AIs before the Fall. These Pro-
metheans were indispensable in protecting transhuman-
ity and countering the TITAN threat during the Fall.
   Despite the efforts of these and similar groups, the
most dire predictions of the outcome of a technologi-
cal singularity were fulfilled. Though each played a
part in the fight, transhumanity was ravaged and the
Earth all but ruined. Though ultimately all attempts
to prevent the Fall failed, untold numbers of transhu-
mans were saved from extinction through such efforts,
while valuable information concerning the TITANs
was gleaned.
   During the crucible of the Fall and its immediate
fallout, some of the surviving members of these and
other groups came together and began to pool their
resources. Acknowledging their weaknesses and the
fractured state of transhumanity, they undertook
drastic new measures, swearing to prevent another
catastrophe of misused technologies. These methods
would forge a new, powerful cross-faction secret soci-
ety known as Firewall.

ORGANIZATION
Firewall is a clandestine organization, with an un-
known number of members, coordinated by an inner
circle of dedicated veterans known as proxies. Though
its existence is known to many of the powerful and
influential factions and individuals throughout the
solar system, its existence is denied and its activities
kept carefully shrouded.

SENTINELS
Sentinels are the soldiers of Firewall, the reserve troops
called to instant active status whenever danger is per-
ceived. Regardless of their location or current affairs,
sentinels are expected to move instantly when called
into play. It is their own responsibility to cover their
absences from their “normal life” during each mission.
  There is no applying to join Firewall. Instead, Fire-
wall selects an individual for induction based upon
that person’s skills, knowledge, occupation, security
clearance, location, status, and a host of other criteria.
While such selections usually originate from a proxy,
sentinels can exercise authority to bring new initiates
into the conspiracy as a mission demands—and they
often do. Any sentinel recruiting a new supporter,
however, becomes responsible for the new inductee
and their actions. If lines are crossed, both will bear
the brunt of the consequences.
  The vetting process for joining Firewall is neces-
sarily brutal, as sentinels are required to face harsh

%%% txt/359.txt
  opponents and make hard choices. If an individual
  agrees to accept the invitation, there is no turning
  back. Each inductee is submitted to a battery of trials
  and tests. While these vary, they may include deep
  background searches, fork interrogation, psycho-
  surgery trials, and tests of loyalty. Psychosurgery is
  performed not to program loyalty, but to analyze the
  recruit’s responses to various situations—an extreme
  parameters test to see when a prospective sentinel
  will break. Many potential members are carefully
  analyzed by a Promethean with extreme expertise in
  character judgment and personality profiling. Those
  who don’t pass such tests are killed in a manner that
  they must resort to an earlier backup or have their
  memories altered, so that they have no recollection of
  their brush with the group.
     Ultimately Firewall walks a fine line. The concept
  of dogmatic “unquestioned loyalty” is both anathema
  to everything Firewall stands and counterproductive.
  Its sentinels need to have the capacity for thinking
  outside of the box from mission to mission. At the
  same time, their ultimate goals are too important to
  risk—the survival of transhumanity depends on it—
  so some extreme measures must sometimes be taken
  to ensure the organization remains intact and secure.
     New sentinels are given a code name and fake
  identification. Outside of the proxies, the real-world
  identity of a given sentinel is a closely-guarded secret.
  Sentinels are even discouraged from sharing such in-
  formation with members of their own teams, though
  this line is often crossed. Additionally, each sentinel is
  required to upload a backup to Firewall’s secure serv-
  ers. This backup serves a dual purpose, enabling all
  sentinels to be retrieved should they die, but also put-
  ting a copy of the sentinel in Firewall’s hands should
  they ever need to interrogate them.
     Sentinels are all connected via the Eye, Firewall’s
  peer-to-peer social network. Though each operates
  behind their assumed identity, they remain in contact,
  sharing information and resources as needed.



OPTIONAL RULE: I-REP
i-Rep tracks the reputation a sentinel earns through
their service to Firewall. i-Rep is used with Network-
ing: Firewall skill and tracked exactly like any other
Reputation score (p. 285). The important thing to
keep in mind, however, is that Firewall agents come
from all factions and are obligated to help each other,
especially when a situation demands it. To reﬂect this
extra advantage, gamemasters can choose to imple-
ment one or more of the following optional rules:
• Networking Plus: To reﬂect that Firewall has
  agents throughout transhumanity, a character
  may use any Networking skill field with their i-
  Rep. Favors bought with reputation still apply
  to the i-rep score, no matter what network they
  were acquired from.
   PROXIES
   Proxies are the inner circle of Firewall, the experienced
   cadre that keeps the machinery of their organiza-
   tion functioning. Though fewer in number than the
   sentinels, many proxies work full time on Firewall
   operations, serving as the group’s essential infrastruc-
   ture. Most proxies are recruited from the ranks of the
   sentinels, brought in based on their skill sets and apti-
   tudes to fill key roles. In a few rare cases, new proxies
   are fast-tracked and recruited directly from outside
   of Firewall, usually based on their unique talents or
   placement within a certain organization, though such
   inductees face a battery of tests and trials far harsher
   than that used to vet sentinels.
      By default, proxies have a higher security clear-
   ance than most sentinels, and are far more in the
   know. This sometimes leads to resentment and hos-
   tilities, especially from sentinels who feel they are
   being kept in the dark or manipulated. While stan-
   dard proxy protocol is to adhere to a need-to-know
   maxim, it is sometimes necessary to bring sentinels
   more into the loop in order to defuse tensions. Of-
   tentimes, this precedes bringing such sentinels into
   the proxy framework.
      Some tension exists within Firewall, mostly due to
   the influence of so many anarchists and other libertar-
   ian autonomists who take a dim view of centralized
   power, lack of transparency, and the potential for se-
   cretive operations to become entrenched and authori-
   tarian. As a result, there is a strong internal culture
   that seeks to minimize hierarchies and the accumu-
   lation of power, promoting transparency and direct
   democratic decision-making. These desires sometimes
   clash with the clandestine nature of the organization,
   however, and the need for some secrets to be kept on
   a need-to-know basis.
      Unlike the loose organization of the sentinels, the
   proxies are grouped into servers, collective working
   groups based upon certain skill sets and tasks. To
   avoid creating power blocks within a given server,




Priority Call: When the chips are really down, a
 entinel can call on favors as a priority urgency.
 his “priority code” is reserved for favors that
are critical to a mission’s success and which may
help save lives or stop a major threat. When the
priority code is invoked, the sentinel receives a
 30 modifier to their Networking Test and favors
are reduced by 2 levels. Sentinels know that pri-
ority codes are only to be used for emergency
 ituations, however, when there are no other
options. Abuse of priority codes is considered
a serious breach of etiquette and abuse of re-
 ources, usually involving the agent’s removal
 rom Firewall.                                 ■

%%% txt/360.txt
personnel are required to rotate between servers
after one year of time. This incurs the added benefit
of proxies learning new skill sets and increasing their
usefulness to Firewall. The actions of each server are
kept as transparent as possible, with major decisions
brought to an e-vote before the entire proxy member-
ship. However, speed often requires servers or indi-
vidual proxies to move quicker than a vote will allow.
In all such instances, the proxies involved are held
accountable for those actions, reviewed by their peers
at a later time to see if any reprimands, punishments,
or commendations are required.
   It is important to note that there is no core leader-
ship structure among the proxies. No one person or
cabal is in charge, there is no authority held by one
proxy or another; all are peers. Though reputation
and experience play a factor, getting something done
often means convincing other proxies that it’s the
right thing to do. The drawback to being a leader
or person with initiative within Firewall is that this
usually means you must follow through with such
tasks yourself. Luckily most proxies are dedicated
to Firewall’s goals and so this DIY attitude prevails.
Despite these safeguards, however, rumors of power
blocks within Firewall (both within servers and
across the organization) exist. Many of these are
fueled by the alliances different cliques hold with
each other. Others, however, whisper that there is
a secret council among the proxies, working behind
the scenes and holding on to knowledge they aren’t
sharing with the rest.
   Crows: Crows continue the goals of Firewall’s
predecessor organizations, such as the Lifeboat In-
stitute and Singularity Foundation. Many of these
are argonauts, promoting the development and use
of new technologies that will benefit the transhuman
condition and minimize risks rather than creating
new threats or sparking new authoritarian uses—
and always conscious of unintended consequences.
Perhaps more importantly, crows actively engage
in background research of potential x-risk vectors,
whether those be aliens, the TITANs, terrorists, or
hypercorp activity. Often they will deploy sentinels
to aid in this research, via routers, whether this
means conducting surveillance or breaking and en-
tering to steal crucial data.
   Erasure Squads: Erasure squads are cleanup per-
sonnel. They are called into action if sentinels fail to
deal appropriately with a situation and the threat is
moving beyond control. If the watchword for a sen-
tinel is “unobtrusive,” the watchwords for an erasure
squad are “overmatched firepower.” If activated, the
time for a subtle solution is passed, and they will use
whatever means necessary to resolve the situation.
If that means nuking a settlement from orbit to an-
nihilate a nanoswarm and keep it from escaping to
a larger settlement, then so be it. After which they’ll
use every trick in Firewall’s bag to erase any evidence

%%% txt/361.txt
CLIQUES
Though Firewall proxies follow stringent guidelines
to ensure the organization is not subverted from
within or turned into a powerful organization
under the thumb of a few individuals with their
own personal agendas, the nature of transhuman-
ity ensures that various factions and tendencies
exist within the group. Termed cliques, these
circles of inﬂuence sometimes create ripples in the
pool that all Firewall personnel must eventually
deal with. Some of these cliques are grounded in
transhumanity’s existing factions, while others are
rooted in philosophical differences regarding the
approach Firewall should be taking. Gamemasters
can use these cliques to ﬂesh out internal tensions
within Firewall or to simply throw some curve balls
to keep players on their toes.
Backups: The backup clique believes that tran-
  shumanity’s best chance for survival is to
  deploy numerous redundant backup measures
  as soon as possible. These include creating as
  many extrasolar colonies as possible, both via
  Pandora Gates and through more traditional
  means, such as ark ships and infomorph/nano-
  fabricator seed ships.
Conservatives: This clique takes an overcau-
 tious, nuke-it-from-orbit approach to most
 x-risks. They believed excessive force is justi-
 fied, and it’s far better to be safe than extinct.
 This clique is also opposed to the use of alien/
 TITAN artifacts and psi, and tends to be xeno-
 phobic/isolationist regarding the Factors and
 Pandora Gates.
Mavericks: The mavericks disdain Firewall’s col-
 lective and bureaucratic tendencies, taking a
 more individualistic approach to their work.
 They are known to sometimes circumvent
 Firewall procedures, taking risks and allocat-
 ing resources without approval from other
 proxies.
Pragmatists: The pragmatists believe in using
 any and all tools at their disposal to counter
 existential risks. They are in favor of using
 xeno-artifacts, asyncs, and anything else that
 will save transhumanity.
Structuralists: This clique advocates for a stron-
  ger structure and centralized authority within
  Firewall, countering the group’s autonomist-
  dominated tendencies. Many also advocate
 for going legitimate, taking Firewall into
 the public eye and making above-board con-
  nections with other official organizations,
  arguing that this could bring more resources
 to Firewall’s disposal.                        ■
they were there and to place the blame for the inci-
dent squarely on the shoulders of some other party.
If necessary, erasure squads can also be called in to
fix a sentinel op that has turned into a clusterfuck or
otherwise gone south. They are very careful to avoid
exposure in such situations, however, which some-
times merely means eliminating all traces of Firewall
involvement and letting the sentinels take the fall for
their poor choices.
   Routers: Routers are mission coordinators. They
work closely with scanners and crows, activating the
appropriate sentinels whenever a new danger rears up.
Each router has the authority to measure the threat
and activate an appropriate number of sentinels—
whatever is required to accomplish the mission in
the least intrusive manner possible. They are also
authorized to divert Firewall resources to aid these
missions, within appropriate parameters. Routers are
held responsible for the ultimate success of a mis-
sion. A failed mission will result in a reviewing board
staffed by their peers.
   Scanners: Tasked with keeping alert for any sign of
new active threats, scanners are the eyes and ears of
Firewall. The scanners maintain a close eye on news-
feeds and mesh traffic, even maintaining taps inside
certain government and hypercorp communication
channels. If a danger is detected, it is under their au-
thority, through routers, that sentinels are activated.
Due to the power inherent in a scanners’ post, they
are held accountable for false activations.
   Social Engineers: Knick-named the Ministry of
Disinformation, social engineers provide the scape-
goating and plausible deniability that is required by
Firewall and its sentinels. If a sentinel compromises
their position and endangers the organization, social
engineers step in to cover cracks in the facade. They
work intrinsically with erasure squads when one is
activated to ensure the over-the-top steps taken to
eliminate a threat are well concealed and ultimately
erased. The power wielded by social engineers can be
significant, as it ultimately decides (usually through
e-voting consensus, though time does not always
allow such a luxury) what organization—political,
corporate, independent, etc.—will take the blame and
subsequent fallout for erasure squad actions.
   Vectors: Vectors are Firewall’s communications se-
curity and digital intrusion specialists—in other words,
hackers. In addition to defending the mesh security
of all Firewall operations, vectors are also deployed
to aid in crow research, scanner monitoring, and to
eliminate the trail of erasure squads. Vectors also
assist routers in maintaining communications, com-
mand, and control of a situation, and are sometimes
called in to provide overwatch of sentinel operations,
especially if a particular sentinel squad lacks their
own hacking resources. Needless to say, vectors are
supplied with some of the best intrusion and security
tools transhumanity has to offer.

%%% txt/362.txt
METHODS
Unobtrusive—that is the standard operating pro-
cedure for any sentinel. Firewall’s continued suc-
cess relies on its secrecy. The larger the footprint
it leaves during a given mission the easier it is for
other organizations to monitor Firewall’s efforts or
even attempt to infiltrate the group. As such, Fire-
wall constantly works to expand its base of allies
(using assets from those ally organizations in place
of its own as much as possible), place long-term
moles, conduct remote operations (hacking in place
of on-site personnel), small group infiltrations (acti-
vating only as many sentinels as required to achieve
mission goals), and so on.
   When it comes to allies, Firewall often obfuscates
its real intentions and even its real identity. Often
such allies are gained through the use of well-placed
sentinels who act on behalf of their own non-
Firewall positions to gain access to another orga-
nization’s resources. At the end of the day, however,
a slice of these resources are secretly set aside for
Firewall’s future use. For example, a department
head at Starware may have spent years sealing a
deal to ship crucial spacecraft parts to the isola-
tionist Jovian Junta. The lucrative deal brings huge
prestige, a job promotion, and a salary increase, all
accomplishments the department head strives for in
his regular life. Yet this particular department head
is a long-standing sentinel, so such accomplish-
ments bring allies to Firewall, whether they know
it or not. Not only can the department head siphon
off a thin stream of revenue for Firewall use (hidden
thoroughly by vectors), but he’s also in a position
to move sentinels, as needed, into the Jovian Junta
habitats (or personnel out), a job usually extremely
difficult to accomplish. The danger of such an act,
of course—and the consequences of losing such a
critically placed sentinel—means such a use of re-
sources is reserved for only the most dire threats.
   In additional to aid from ally organizations, Fire-
wall places caches of supplies on different habitats
and worlds, available to sentinels as needed. How
many and which sentinels are aware of which
caches depends wholly on the situation and on the
decisions of the router(s) involved. In a given habi-
tat, a cache may include weaponry and equipment
of escalating power, archived information, or even
relics stashed from previous missions until Firewall
decides what to do with them. Large habitats may
even feature several caches, with routers only re-
vealing the ones with heavy firepower when abso-
lutely needed. Some caches may be so dangerous,
however, that once a mission is complete, a router
will authorize the cortical stack destruction of all
sentinels involved, resleeving them to a backup that
has no knowledge of the cache’s existence.
   As noted under erasure squads, Firewall will not
hesitate to react with swift and unequivocal force if
an unobtrusive approach has failed and the danger
  WHAT HELP CAN A
  SENTINEL EXPECT?
   Exactly what help Firewall provides to a senti-
   nel during a mission is wholly dependent upon
   the situation and the gamemaster. Generally
   speaking, Firewall’s unobtrusive approach also
   applies to activated sentinels, meaning that
   sentinels are largely left to operate on their
   own accord. Beyond access to a cache of sup-
   plies—usually under-stated, forcing a sentinel
   to use their own resources if they want more—
   Firewall expects its sentinels to be capable of
   handling a situation. In addition to their skills
   and wits, sentinels can, of course, rely heavily
   on their i-rep to gain the resources and favors
   they need to achieve success.
      In some rare cases, the gamemaster may
   decide that a situation warrants more or less
   equipment in a cache or help from social engi-
   neers or vectors. Such intervention should be
   kept to a minimum, however, to lesson the
   players’ feelings of Deus Ex Machina, ensuring
   the appropriate response of awe when such
   events do occur.
     The one thing for which Firewall can always
   be relied on is backup insurance. Any Firewall
   killed in the line of duty will be resleeved at
   Firewall’s expense—though the morph used
   and whether the sentinel was backed up from
   their cortical stack or a backup (perhaps even
   an old backup) depends entirely on the circum-
   stances of death and their router’s whim. Fire-
   wall usually makes an extra effort to retrieve
   cortical stacks, however, not in the least as they
   don’t want their agents’ backups falling into
   the wrong hands.
      Similarly, if a Firewall mission involves ego-
   casting or travel to another destination, Fire-
   wall will usually foot the bill. In many cases
   it is easier for sentinels to cover the expense
   themselves and bill Firewall later, but in times
   of need Firewall can be called on to handle
   such expenses directly.                         ■




 reaches a certain threat level. What constitutes a
“threat threshold” is actually calculated by special-
 ized risk assessment software and may change from
 mission to mission according to other external fac-
 tors. In some instances, if the situation is dangerous
 enough and the scale of the consequences of failure
 large enough, a Promethean will be tapped to cal-
 culate the threat level and decide when it is time to
 tactically withdrawal and “thermally cleanse.”

LONG-TERM STRATEGIES AND GOALS
The overriding goals of Firewall are to prevent existen-
tial threats and protect transhumanity. However, that
is not their only goal. Their exact goals can and should
remain directed by the gamemaster as it applies to a
given playing group and a campaign. This can also
depend heavily on the particular cliques that a given
gamemaster is emphasizing (see Cliques, p. 359).
   The following is an easy-to-use selection of long-
term strategies and goals that a gamemaster can use
as desired:

 • Seeding other star systems
 • Going legit vs. staying clandestine
 • Development of stable seed AIs
 • Finding out where the TITANs went
 • Finding out what happened to the uploaded tran-
   shumans that the TITANs disappeared with
 • Figuring out the Factors
 • Making contact with other aliens
 • Finding out what happened to the Iktomi and
   other xeno-archeological oddities

FIREWALL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
The level to which Firewall has infiltrated other orga-
nizations (and vice versa!) is intentionally left a blank
slate. Eclipse Phase is an active universe, with an on-
going storyline, so such details will be fleshed out and
updated as additional sourcebooks are published. Ad-
ditionally, gamemasters should determine the extent of
such infiltrations for their own games and campaigns,
as dictated by the plot and storyline the gamemaster
and players wish to tell.
  The following is a quick list of the most obvious
interactions.

 • Inner System: Almost all inner system factions
   consider Firewall to be an illegal, rogue operation,
   tainted by anarchists and undermining the very
   fabric of their society. Some hypercorps, however,
   believe they can infiltrate the organization and
   use it for their own ends, such as spying on and
   sabotaging other hypercorps and factions.
 • Jovian Republic: The Junta loathes Firewall and
   all it stands for and will use extreme measures to
   combat even the hint of Firewall activity within
   its sphere of influence.
 • Titanians: Most Titanians in-the-know are
   not necessarily opposed to Firewall’s activi-
   ties, but believe the group should be reined in
   and legitimized.



THE ETI
As noted under Extraterrestrial Intelligences, p. 352,
the ETI is the advanced alien civilization responsible
for the Exsurgent virus (p. 362), and by extension,
the corruption of the TITANs and the Fall.
   HANDLING ALIENS
  Though only a handful of aliens have been intro
  duced to Eclipse Phase so far, gamemaster may
  wish to introduce their own. This is perfectly
  acceptable, though we strongly recommend
  that any and all alien life be portrayed as con
  vincingly alien. Life forms that have evolved in
  drastically different environmental circumstances
  from humans and that grew into intelligence by
  a different path should seem, at best, bizarre
  unusual, and weird. There is no guarantee that
  a xenomorph’s thought processes or modes of
  thinking are in any way similar to transhuman
  ones, or even that their emotional responses
  (based on a completely different biology—if they
  have emotions, that is) are in the same ballpark
  Communication is likely to be a challenge, and
  misunderstandings are practically guaranteed. ■



   No one, not even the Factors, has encountered a
member (if such exists) of the ETI civilization so far.
Since it is an intelligence far beyond transhumanity, it
likely won’t play much of a direct role within Eclipse
Phase, though those who learn the truth about the
Exsurgent virus and the Fall may rightly fear the
future. No one can even imagine what might happen
next, however, or know for certain that the ETI has
not set more “traps” similar to their bracewell probes
or if they have other messengers or servants active in
the galaxy. With things such as the Pandora Gates
at transhumanity’s disposal, it may just be a matter
of time before transhuman explorers run afoul some
other aspect of the ETI’s existence and activities.
   It is important to keep the nature of the ETI in
perspective. While transhumanity has managed
what it considers wonders with a small handful of
resources available from a few planets and other
objects in a bare handful of star systems, the ETI
has had an entire galaxy at its disposal for eons.
Engineering projects on a massive scale—dyson
spheres, matrioshka brains, Jupiter brains, stellar
engines—are within its capabilities. This ETI uses
star clusters as transhumanity uses fi elds or rich
mineral veins. Given its potential, the ETI likely
exists primarily on the galactic rim, far from the
galactic center, where lower temperatures and
scarcer matter make for a good thermodynamic en-
vironment. The powers in the deep cold dark on the
edge of the Milky Way have been self-aware since
before Earth was so much as a ripple in warming
gas around the not-yet-ignited Sun.
   Despite what those-in-the-know in the Eclipse
Phase universe may think, the ETI is not necessar-
ily hostile towards other races like transhumanity
(depending on its outlook; see p. 353), at least not

%%% txt/364.txt
in the way as transhumanity would define animos-
ity because of religious, ethnic, racial, or cultural
difference. Most likely the ETI is simply indifferent,
concerned with matters on scales on which trans-
humanity does not even register. Or it may think of
transhumanity like a living body might recognize an
infection or parasite—something the immune system
will suppress and deal with.

EXHUMANS
Exhumans are a faction within Eclipse Phase that
seeks to transcend the transhuman and become
posthuman. More to the point, exhumans seek to
perfect their physical and mental capabilities to ex-
treme levels, in search of some perfectionist ideal or
to become something higher-up on the evolutionary
ladder. Exactly what this is differs from exhuman to
exhuman, but there is generally some adherence to
Nietzschean philosophy and a goal to reach the pin-
nacle of the food chain. Some exhumans have trans-
formed themselves into what they consider to be an
ideal predator, or a creature that is extra-adaptable
and so best able to survive. Others radically modify
their own brains in order to drastically surpass
transhuman intelligence. Most are singularity seek-
ers, eager and willing to follow the breadcrumbs
left by the TITANs or other entities in the hope that
they will find the means of transcending transhu-
man limitations.
   Due to the use of numerous extreme, experimental,
and dangerous self-modifications, some exhumans
have done permanent damage to their psyches,
becoming insane, or perhaps just transferring their
mode of thinking into something that is no longer
recognizable as human. Some have also adopted an
antagonistic view of their former transhuman species,
viewing it as weak, decadent, and unworthy. This
has spurred some exhumans to actively attack and
ravage transhuman settlements and ships, though
usually in isolated areas.
  A few examples of exhumans are described below,
though gamemasters are encouraged to develop
their own.

NEURODES
Seeking to achieve a new level of super-intelligence
and conscience, neurodes have abandoned the typi-
cal transhuman sleeve in exchange for a multipedal
neuronal shell that is both body and brain at the same
time. The bulk of a neurode’s body mass consists of
amorphic clusters of neuronal and epithelial cells, en-
closed in a hard carapace shell with four legs and two
manipulatory digits. The cerebral mass of neurode
brains gives them impressive calculation and other
mental capabilities far exceeding that of a normal
transhuman. Neurodes typically defend themselves
with swarms of teleoperated drones.

PREDATORS
Predators seek to transform themselves into an ulti-
mate top-of-the-food-chain evolutionary contender.
They pursue new avenues in genetic modification and
prototype implants, often using controversial methods
and technologies. The biochemical instabilities resulting
from these untested modifications and altered metabo-
lisms, however, often negatively impact their emotional
and mental stability. Pushing this even further, some
predators undergo experimental psychosurgery to
modify their consciousnesses in order to increase cun-
ning and ruthlessness, a procedure that often has other
negative side effects. A few predators take their surviv-
al-of-the-fittest ideology to an extreme, modifying their
digestive systems for a cannibalistic diet, and relishing
in the slaughter and feasting on of transhumans.

THE EXSURGENT VIRUS
Only very few people (or entities) who survived the
diaspora from Earth know of the true reasons and
the catalyst that culminated in the Fall. The alien Ex-
surgent virus—as those aware of its existence within
Firewall call it—set in place by the ETI to infect
emerging seed AIs, is something beyond transhuman-
ity’s understanding; something far more complex
than just a computer virus. Though some strains of
the Exsurgent virus have been identified and various
types of infected exsurgents have been encountered,
it is widely assumed that these are creations of the
TITANs. Largely defeated and eradicated from off-
Earth transhuman networks thanks to the efforts of

%%% txt/365.txt
the Prometheans, occasional breakouts of the Exsur-
gent virus still occur, primarily due to scavengers or
others becoming infected when messing with old relics
from the Fall.

PLETHORA OF STRAINS
The Exsurgent virus is unlike anything that transhu-
manity has ever encountered so far. While it bears
similarities with both computer and biological virii in
regards to infection of hosts and propagation, it is not
bound by any limits of form or transmission vector.
   The Exsurgent virus is amazingly effective and
infectious. As an information virus, it is highly intel-
ligent and adaptive, able to mutate into new forms.
Much like certain virii are able to cross species
boundaries or change their vector from contact to
airborne, it is also a self-morphing omnivirus, ca-
pable of altering itself and its transmission vectors
to bypass infection safeguards. Like a retrovirus that
incorporates genetic information into the genome of
the target cell to subvert the cell to do its bidding, the
Exsurgent virus does the same but on a more com-
plex level. It is also known to rewrite a host’s neural
code in a similar manner, in effect restructuring the
target’s mind and personality.
   While it began as a digital computer virus—the
manner in which it infected the TITANs—it has trans-
formed to be communicable via at least three other
forms: biological nanovirus, nanoplague, and basilisk
hack. Each is described below, along with rules for
infection and defense.

BIOLOGICAL NANOVIRUS
Exploiting the infected TITANs’ understanding of
Terran biology and their access to bio- and nanotech-
nology, the Exsurgent virus appeared in several biolog-
ical forms not long into the Fall. These virulent strains
infected biomorph transhumans and sometimes other
living creatures as well. The biological nanobots
spreading this strain act much like other biological
virii, though they radically modify the victim’s bio-
logical and mental states. Some versions invade and
restructure the target’s genetic code, transforming
them into the horrible abominations known as ex-
surgents (p. 369). While first-hand reports relate lurid
tales of victims metamorphing into hostile monsters,
such reports are rare and considered unreliable due to
the mental state of the witnesses (and any recordings
that can verify such claims have a strange habit of
disappearing). Other variants of this strain are known
only to alter the target’s neural code, subverting them
to the will of the virus (and often, by extension, the
TITANs) and affecting their mental structure in order
to give them psi ability.

BIOLOGICAL INFECTION
Biological versions are spread much like other patho-
gens. People usually become infected by proximity to
another infected entity. Vectors may be dermal (touch-
ing someone with bio-nanobots excreted through the
skin), inhalation (breathing exhaled bio-nanobots),
injection, or oral (p. 317). Exsurgent bio-nanobots can
live outside of a body for extended periods, however,
so infection is possible merely by occupying the space
where an infected victim was hours or even days before.
   If a biomorph only has a chance of exposure to the
virus (e.g., they walk through a room in which they
might have breathed in exhaled bio-nanobots), have
them make a MOX x 10 Test (use their Moxie stat,
not their current Moxie score). Failure means they
were exposed. In other circumstances, however, expo-
sure may be automatic, such as extended touching of
or kissing an infected person.
   A biomorph exposed to this infection must make
a DUR x 2 Test to determine if the infection takes
hold. Basic bio-mods and nanophages do not offer

%%% txt/366.txt
any protection, though toxin filters (p. 305) and
medichines (p. 308) each give a +30 bonus (though it
is likely only a matter of time before a mutant Exsur-
gent strain learns to bypass them). If the test fails, the
victim is infected. See the strain descriptions (p. 366)
for specific details.
   Within 12 hours of being infected, biomorphs
become contagious to others. (Note that for the
Watts-Macleod strain, they only remain contagious
for 12 hours after that.)

DIGITAL VIRUS
Digital strains are purely information- or code-based
versions of the virus. They resemble typical computer
virii, worms, or trojans, spreading throughout the
mesh, exploiting holes, mimicking protocols, and
taking advantage of it like a skilled hacker.
   Digital versions of the Exsurgent virus are treated
as intelligent programs, using the same rules as info-
morphs (p. 264), with the following stats:
 COG     COO    INT    REF    SAV    SOM     WIL   MOX
  40      10     40     40     40     40     40     —

  INIT   SPD    LUC     TT     IR    DUR     WT     DR
  160     3      —      —      —      —      —      —
Skills: Hardware: Electronics 50, Infosec 70, Interfac-
  ing 60, Investigation 50, Perception 60, Program-
  ming 50
Software: Exploit, Firewall, Sniffer, Spoof, Track, plus
  any others the gamemaster considers appropriate

DIGITAL INFECTION
  As a matter of course, this Exsurgent virus will seek
to access any new systems it comes into contact with,
hacking in and copying a version of itself.

AI AND INFOMORPH SUBVERSION
   An Exsurgent virus may take a Complex Action to
initiate an “attack” against any other intelligent pro-
gram (AI, AGI, or infomorph) that is running on the
same system. If it encounters such programs as they
are accessing a system it is on, it will attempt to hack
their home system where they are running so as to
attack them directly.
   The attack is handled as an Opposed Test, each roll-
ing COG + INT. If the Exsurgent virus wins, the target
is infected and will be corrupted by the virus in 10
Action Turns, minus 1 turn per 10 full points of MoS.
If the target succeeded but rolled lower than the virus,
they are aware that they are slowly being taken over.
This immediately causes them 1d10 points of mental
stress. An infected program has only one option for
defending itself before the virus takes over—shutdown
and reboot. It takes the AI or infomorph 1 full Action
Turn to shut down. Restarting takes 3 full Action Turns
(possibly longer if the gamemaster so decides), upon
which the AI or infomorph must make another Op-
posed COG + INT Test against the virus. If this test also
fails, then the virus has already embedded itself in the
AI or infomorph’s code and will continue its infection.
   One the infection is complete, the AI/infomorph
becomes an Exsurgent NPC.
CYBERBRAIN HACKING
Exsurgent virii that manage to infiltrate the cyber-
brains of pods and synthmorphs may also target the
digital egos within, using the same rules as given for
AI and infomorph subversion above. Alternately, the
virus may conduct a traditional brainhacking attack,
as noted on p. 261, or unleash a basilisk hack.

NANOPLAGUE
While the abundance of nanotechnology has been a
blessing for transhumanity’s journey to the stars, it has
also been a curse. Via the TITANs and mesh-connected
nanofabrication machines, the Exsurgent virus manu-
factured nanobot swarms equipped with variants of
the virus. These nanobot plagues are capable of target-
ing all types of morphs and sometimes other machin-
ery as well. Unlike the biological nanovirus, which uses
biological mechanisms to rewrite biological/neural
structures, these nanoplagues physically restructure
both people and things at the molecular level.

NANOPLAGUE INFECTION
Exsurgent nanoswarms follow all of the rules given
for nanoswarms on p. 328. Unlike transhuman
nanoswarms, though, Exsurgent nanoplagues may
penetrate a biomorph internally, affecting the body
within as well as without.
  Any morph that comes into contact with a nano-
plague is considered infected. The only defenses are
guardian nanobots and nanophages (which work the
same as guardian nanobots in this situation), though
these are less effective against Exsurgent nanobots,
inflicting –2 damage to the swarm each Action Turn.
Some Exsurgent nanoplagues have developed coun-
termeasures against such systems, inflicting (1d10 ÷ 2,
round up) damage to such defenses each Action Turn.
Note that nanoplague-infected characters are gener-
ally not contagious themselves ... usually.
   See the strain descriptions (p. 366) for specific in-
fection details.

BASILISK HACKS
Thanks to the vast databanks of knowledge the TITANs
had absorbed from transhumanity, the Exsurgent virus
was able to thoroughly analyze the biology and func-
tioning of transhuman minds. In a few short months, by
accessing all of the research at their disposal, the Exsur-
gent and TITAN minds made several cognitive leaps in
their understanding of transhuman brain functions—
breakthroughs that will take transhumanity decades to
reach. One of these discoveries was a method of apply-
ing sensory input as a weapon, exploiting weaknesses
in the brain’s neuro-cerebral wiring.
   Known as “basilisk hacks,” these attacks take
advantage of the way biological transhuman brains
interpret and process sensory input in the cerebral
cortex. Just as epileptics are susceptible to visualiza-
tions that strobe at certain frequencies, basilisk hacks
employ special visual and auditory patterns that trig-
ger glitches in the brain’s neuronal wiring to inflict

%%% txt/367.txt
nausea, vertigo, disorientation, and even seizures,
often mistaken as a stroke or cerebrovascular incident.
Some basilisk hacks go farther than simply causing
the brain to seize up and crash, however, enabling a
mechanism to rewrite the neural code in victims who
view or listen to the wrong thing. This unknown re-
programming mechanism enables the virus to infect
even a biological brain with one of its strains. Similar
attacks are used against both synthmorphs and pods,
taking advantage of the methods in which cyberbrains
mimic biological minds with a virtual brain state, and
thus also manipulating them via the information en-
coded in sensory input.
   In a nutshell, basilisk hacks are a way of hacking
transhuman brains merely by feeding them a specific
sample of sensory input, usually images or sounds.
The widespread use of augmented reality makes
deployment of such hacks an easy manner; the Ex-
surgent virus just hacks into the target’s ecto or mesh
inserts and engages the sensory feed. More traditional
methods may also be used, including standard interac-
tive video, holograms, audio, subsonics, or even VR.
   Since so many records of the years surrounding
the Fall were lost, most people do not know if the
basilisk hack is anything other than a legend. Various
official groups know that this technology was, in fact,
used by the TITANs, but they keep this knowledge to
themselves, in large part to help reduce the number of
people attempting to duplicate it.

INCAPACITATING INPUTS
When a character experiences a basilisk hack, they
must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this test
fails, their brain is susceptible to the hack, and they
immediately suffer 1d10 mental stress. Additionally,
one of the following effects applies. The duration for
each effect listed below is 1 minute plus 1 additional
minute per 10 full points of MoF. Each effect is also
numbered 1–10, in case the gamemaster wants to roll
1d10 and randomize the effects rather than choose:

 • (1) Cataplexy: The victim loses control of their
   body and immediately collapses. For the duration
   their body will be non-responsive but they will
   be aware and capable of mental actions. Mesh
   actions and implant controls are also disabled,
   however.
 • (2) Catatonic Stupor: The character becomes
   immobile and non-responsive. Though conscious,
   they are mentally “not there”—the basilisk hack
   has effectively crashed their brain functions. They
   will do absolutely nothing for the duration and
   will not respond even if moved or attacked.
 • (3) Disorientation: The character becomes disori-
   ented and severely confused. They are incapable
   of making decisions, understanding communica-
   tion, understanding what is going on around
   them, or acting in any sort of determined way for
   the duration.
  • (4–5) Grand Mal Seizures: The subject immedi-
    ately falls to the ground and begins convulsing,
    suffering 1d10 damage. They may do nothing
    else for the duration and will suffer an equal
    duration period of confusion and weakness (–30
    to all actions) afterwards.
  • (6–7) Hallucinations: The character immediately
    goes off on a mental trip, leaving them completely
    disconnected from reality and their physical body.
    For the duration, the character should only re-
    spond to the hallucinated reality the gamemaster
    describes to them, or else the character should be
    treated as an NPC, run by the gamemaster.
  • (8) Impaired Cognition: The character’s mental
    capabilities bottom out, turning them into a
    disabled vegetable. COG, INT, SAV, and WIL all
    drop to 1, and the character should act accord-
    ingly to environmental stimuli.
  • (9) Nausea/Vertigo: The character is overcome
    with head-spinning and vomiting and is effec-
    tively incapacitated for the duration.
  • (10) Sleep: The character passes out for the
    duration and cannot be woken short of medical
    intervention.

  In rare cases, a character may be able to “dodge”
a basilisk hack they know is coming, assuming they
have some sort of warning (such as their buddy fall-
ing prey to it moments before). The character must of
course be aware of what basilisk hacks are to even
consider this idea. If they immediately attempt to take
action to block out the sensory input when it strikes—
closing their eyes, plugging their ears, turning off their
AR, etc.—allow them a REF x 3 Test to see if they do
so in time.

SENSORY REPROGRAMMING
In some cases, the Exsurgent virus can actually repro-
gram the target’s mind via dedicated sensory input.
This is a trickier affair, however, requiring uninterrupt-
ed programming time. As with incapacitating inputs,
the target character(s) experiencing the basilisk hack
must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, they
become catatonic and paralyzed for a period of 10
minutes, minus 1 minute per 10 full points of MoF. At
the end of this period, they are mentally reprogrammed
and “infected” with one of the strains of the Exsurgent
virus (see below). For the duration of this period, the
character is undergoing reprogramming as long as they
remain exposed to the basilisk hack. If the character is
somehow cut off through the actions of another party,
the reprogramming immediately fails. In this case,
however, the victim still suffers 1d10 mental stress
+ 1 per minute they were exposed, and they remain
mentally shaken, suffering a –30 modifier to all actions.
This modifier reduces at the rate of 10 per minute.

YGBM ATTACKS
Rather than completely reprogramming a victim, some
Exsurgent attacks simply intend to plant subconscious

%%% txt/368.txt
commands in the target’s mind, similar to posthyp-
notic suggestions. Nicknamed “You gotta believe me”
attacks, YGBMs are a sort of remote digital brain-
washing attempt used to create sleeper terrorists and
unknowing collaborators, often by targeting them via
the mesh. Unlike the mind manipulation techniques
of psychosurgery (p. 229), YGBM attacks use shotgun
techniques to open the mind, utilizing some kind of
backdoor the Exsurgents discovered in the transhu-
man brain, and altering the mind by brute force.
  A character experiencing a YGBM basilisk hack
must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, a
single suggestion is implanted in the character’s mind,
without their knowledge. This subliminal command
will be triggered at some later point, either at some
predesignated time or according to certain pre-set
conditions. Once triggered, the character will carry
out the action with all of the conviction that it is their
own idea. The implanted suggestion may be something
as simple as “kill the Firewall agent” to something as
complex as “manufacture an explosive device and
plant it in the cargo hold of any ship heading to Mars,
set to explode one day after they disembark.”
   Since YGBM attacks are not intended to completely
convert the target, but instead to simply convert them
into a temporary tool or weapon, implanted com-
mands are not designed to last long. The duration
the suggestion will last equals 3 days +1 day per 10
points of MoF on the resistance test. If the command
has not been triggered by this point, it dissipates, and
the character is none the wiser.

RECORDING BASILISK HACKS
Enterprising characters may seek to record a basilisk
hack input for their own uses. While basilisk hacks may
be recorded like any other sensory input, keep in mind
that the Exsurgents and TITANs likely take measures
to keep such tools out of the hands of transhumanity,
lest they construct some sort of defense. Basilisk hack
sources may be self-erasing or contain coding or coun-
termeasures that would hinder recording, such as white
noise to defeat audio recording or lens-blinding flashes
to defeat video recording. Conversely, basilisk hacks are
considered extremely dangerous by almost all factions
of transhumanity and universally feared. An individual
or group known to possess them is likely to be treated
much like a terrorist with a suitcase nuke. Though
Firewall has a standard interest in evaluating and en-
abling some sort of defense against basilisk hacks, most
Firewall personnel consider it foolish to handle such
toys and would rather destroy such recordings outright.

EXSURGENT STRAINS
Four variants of the Exsurgent virus are described
here—gamemasters are encouraged to develop their
own to keep players on their toes.

HAUNTING VIRUS
This strain is the most insidious of the Exsurgent virii.
Over time, it rewrites the target’s personality and
motivations, slowly but surely subverting and taking
control of the victim’s mind. At first the character is
unlikely to even be aware of the infection, and as it
progresses the changes the virus makes to the target
will at first seem natural to the target, as if some new
aspect of their personality was simply manifesting
itself. As the effects grow more pronounced, however,
the victim becomes aware that they are being methodi-
cally altered but is in most cases unable to act against
it. In the end, they are completely transformed into a
pawn of the ETI. Their mind is no longer transhuman,
but alien.
   The exact rate of progression is up to the gamemas-
ter, though guidelines are provided below. Each victim
is affected differently, so the process may be accelerated
or slowed down as the gamemaster sees fit.

%%% txt/369.txt
 • Stage 1 (initial infection to 3 months): Upon ini-
   tial infection, the character suffers 1d10 mental
   stress and gains the Psi trait (p. 147) at Level 1
   (also meaning they pick up the Mental Disorder
   trait, as noted on p. 150). They also gain one free
   psi-chi sleight, chosen randomly or by the game-
   master. If a player character has become infected,
   they may still be played as normal (see Roleplay-
   ing Exsurgents, p. 368), and may purchase new
   psi-chi sleights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1
   new sleight per 2–4 weeks.
   At this stage, the infection is usually hidden,
   though the character will suffer from occasional
   haunting effects (see below). As each week passes,
   the character’s personality should shift a minute
   amount, slowly becoming more callous and con-
   niving and changing in other ways as well. If
   possible, the player should be kept in the dark
   about what is happening, but the gamemaster
   should provide them with roleplaying advice to
   reflect their condition. Likewise, the discovery
   and initial use of psi sleights should be played
   out, providing some interesting roleplaying op-
   portunities. Characters and players who know of
   the Exsurgent virus and Watts-Macleod strains
   should not know at this point which strain they
   are infected with—make them sweat.
 • Stage 2 (3 months to 6 months): The target suf-
   fers another 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress
   and acquires the Psi trait at Level 2 (also pick-
   ing up another disorder). Player characters may
   still be played as normal and may purchase psi-
   gamma slights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1
   new sleight per 2–4 weeks.
   Once three months have passed, the character
   should be aware they are under the influence
   of something, but this awareness likely comes
   too late. Haunting effects (below) should occur
   regularly. At this point a character is likely to
   consider offing themselves and resorting to an
   uninfected backup, seeking help, or actively en-
   couraging others to interfere. The infection will
   actively block and hinder such thoughts and ac-
   tions, however. To actively overcome this mental
   control, the character must succeed in a WIL Test.
   At the gamemaster’s discretion, failure may result
   in 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress as the char-
   acter realizes they are no longer fully in control
   of their own thoughts and actions.
 • Stage 3 (6 months+): The victim suffers another
   1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress and acquires
   the Psi trait at Level 3 (see below). The character
   is now considered an exsurgent and becomes
   an NPC. It may no longer be played as a player
   character. The victim also gains a permanent
   +5 bonus to COG and WIL and acquires 1 new
   sleight every 1–2 months.

  As noted above, characters infected with this strain
suffer from different haunting effects—changes
to their personality or mind-state. A few ideas for
haunting effects are noted here, but gamemasters are
encouraged to be creative when inventing their own
to apply:

  • Altered Perceptions: The victim’s perceptions are
    changed in disturbing and unusual ways. They
    may see things that aren’t there, feel a presence
    behind or watching them, inexplicably smell
    blood, hear voices, suffer synaesthesia, or sud-
    denly perceive the people around them as nothing
    but outlandish, blabbering sacks of meat.
  • Behavioral Modification: Treat as behavioral con-
    trol or personality editing psychosurgery (p. 231).
    This is typically applied to shape the character
    closer to being a pawn of the ETI.
  • Dream Manipulation: The character’s dreams
    become lucid, weird, and surreal. They may find
    themselves dreaming of life as an alien on some
    exotic exoplanet, as a robotic probe soaring
    through the vast emptiness of space, or fantasiz-
    ing different methods of inflicting mass destruc-
    tion and death.
  • Emotional Manipulation: Treat as emotional
    control psychosurgery (p. 231).
  • Inexplicable Urges: The character will be flushed
    with strange alien urges and may sometimes find
    themselves doing highly unusual things without
    realizing at all they are doing it. These may in-
    clude taking devices apart to understand how
    they work, testing the limits on programming a
    nanofabricator, cutting a living thing apart to see
    how it is put together biologically, testing weap-
    ons, eating things that are only barely edible, pro-
    miscuous and unusual sexual activity, lying just
    to see what they can get away with, and so on.

MINDSTEALER VIRUS
Very similar to the haunting virus, the mindstealer
 strain is much quicker acting. Instead of slowly sub-
verting the target’s mind over the course of months,
the mindstealer virus rapidly recodes the victim’s brain
in a matter of minutes. This infection is much more
invasive and brute-force, often causing significant
 side effects to the target’s mental state as a result. This
 strain is only spread as a digital virus, nanoplague, or
basilisk hack (not as a biological nanovirus).
    Once the victim is infected, it takes the virus a
number of Action Turns equal to COG + INT + SAV
to completely take over their mind (20 Action Turns
= 1 minute). During this time, the target is actively
aware that their mind is under attack and undergo-
ing massive changes against their will. This process
is confusing, frightening, and painful, inflicting a
–30 modifier to all of the character’s actions for the
duration. Many victims are reduced to whimpering,
drooling, or convulsing for the duration.
   This mental transformation inflicts 2d10 mental
 stress to the target. Once complete, the victim is an
 exsurgent NPC, under the gamemaster’s control.

%%% txt/370.txt
WATTS-MACLEOD VIRUS
The Watts-Macleod strain is a strangely benevolent
version of the Exsurgent virus, seeming to imbue its
victims with psi abilities without any of the other
transformative elements typical of other strains.
Perhaps created as an accidental mutation of the Ex-
surgent virus, there are many who wonder if the true
detrimental effects of this strain simply have yet to
reveal themselves.
  As noted in the Mind Hacks chapter section on Psi
(p. 220), characters infected with this strain gain the
Psi trait (p. 147) at either Level 1 or 2. If a character
is so infected during game play, this trait must be
purchased with Rez Points (if the character does not
have any points currently available, they pay out of
the points they earn until the debt is paid off). All of
the other side effects of Watts-Macleod infection (p.
367) also apply.
   Though infection with this strain does apply some
benefits to the character, the gamemaster should make
sure to play up the creepy and unsettling nature of
this virus. The character should never be certain that
they haven’t in fact been subtly influenced by the virus
in ways they can’t immediately pinpoint—they should
always feel like the ax may fall at any moment.

XENOMORPH VIRUS
The xenomorph strain transforms the target’s body
in addition to their mind. Over time, the victims
morph physically transmogrifies into some sort
of alien life form. It is only spread as a biological
nanovirus or nanoplague (not as a digital virus or
basilisk hack). Different variants of this strain pro-
duce different alien forms. It is not known where
these different alien templates originated, meaning
they may be copies of (once) existing alien species
or simply neogenetic creatures created from scratch.
The one trait they have in common is that they are
universally dangerous. Some speculation in Firewall
circles suggests that the Exsurgent virus may in fact
have a “library” of creature types to deploy, under
the assumption that at least some will be more effec-
tive than others for exterminating whatever victim
species they are fielded against.
   This strain follows the same rules as the haunting
virus (above), but with the following changes. The
timeframe is typically much quicker, though the game-
master may adjust this as they see fit.
   Stage 1: The effects from Stage 1 of the haunting
virus apply. Additionally, the character begins to suffer
minor physical changes that are definitely unusual but
are not impeding in any way and are easily hidden
from others. Example biomorph alterations might be:
unusual hair or fibrous growth, some skin discolor-
ation or translucence, severe rashes, dermal thicken-
ing, weakened or enhanced sensory organs, strong
body odor, hair loss, teeth gain or loss, vestigial tail or
other limb growth, minor dietary changes, and so on.
Synthmorphs might experience minor system glitches,
malfunctioning or improved components, and spots
of material stress or transfiguration. Gamemasters
are encouraged to be creative. This stage typically
lasts from initial infection to 1 week for biological
nanovirus strains, or from infection to just 1 hour for
nanoplague strains.
   Stage 2: As with haunting virus Stage 2, plus the
character begins to seriously transmogrify in ways
that are diffi cult to hide from others, becoming
more and more monstrous as the stage progresses.
Example biomorph transformations include: grow-
ing scales or feathers, partial modification of limb
structure, partial new limb growth, vestigial sensory
organ growth, sensory loss, extension of claws or
spines, severe dietary changes, etc. Synthmorphs
might experience radical system and shape altera-
tions, limited or enhanced sensor functions, or even
conversion of their robotic shell to smart materials.
These physical changes weaken the victim, inflicting
1d10 physical damage. This stage typically lasts 1
week for biological nanovirus strains or just 1 hour
for nanoplague strains.
   Stage 3: As with haunting virus Stage 3, a character
reaching this stage becomes an NPC. Additionally,
the victim completely undergoes a transformation
into some sort of creature that is no longer even re-
motely human. Example exsurgents of this nature are
detailed on p. 369.

USING THE EXSURGENT VIRUS
The frightening thing about the Exsurgent virus is
its adaptability. It was written by a near omnipotent
ETI with the intent of corrupting any alien seed AIs
or similar singularities it encountered, and it is very
good at it. This means it has the capability to ana-
lyze, understand, and mimic almost any alien digital
protocols and communication methods it comes into
contact with, no matter how diverse the alien mindset
that constructed what it encounters. It then has a cun-
ning ability to circumvent any safeguards and infect
such systems. From there, it rapidly assimilates any
data it can about the target species/civilization and
does it best to mutate into other forms that can attack
this target from other vectors.
   Given its constant morphing nature then, the Ex-
surgent virus is likely to continue to mutate in new
and interesting ways. Some of these mutations may
be effective, many not. This does, however, afford the
gamemaster an opportunity to invent new variants of
their own to deploy against unsuspecting characters.

ROLEPLAYING EXSURGENTS
The primary thing for gamemasters to keep in mind
when roleplaying entities that have been taken over
by the Exsurgent virus is that exsurgents are follow-
ing an alien agenda. The specific goals and actions of
each exsurgent may differ, but they are generally con-
cerned with two things: spreading the Exsurgent virus
and destroying anything that isn’t affected. In some
cases, this may mean immediate and enraged hostile
action against anything non-exsurgent around them.

%%% txt/371.txt
In others, the exsurgent approach is more methodi-
cal, hatching long-term plots to infiltrate positions of
power and authority, setting the stage for acts of mass
destruction, and so on. In other words, they may be
handled both as hostile monsters or as nefarious long-
term opponents that are subverting transhumanity
from within or hatching complicated plots that could
mean devastation on a planetary scale.
   If the gamemaster wishes, exsurgents may also
pursue other goals, tangential to the ones above.
These may range from accumulating knowledge and
expertise on how transhumanity functions as a spe-
cies to forcibly uploading mass numbers of minds to
more esoteric goals such as manufacturing a halfnium
bomb or converting the solar system’s mass to compu-
tronium. The Exsurgent virus is potent and intelligent,
and while its methods and goals may sometimes be
opaque to transhumanity, it acts with direction and
purpose. There may also be occasions, however, likely
due to the mutating and morphing aspect of the virus
and the way in which it transforms transhuman
minds, perhaps not always in the manner intended,
where the exsurgent goals become strange or simply
horrific, such as running experiments on transhuman
responses to extreme conditions or converting an
entire colony to cannibalism.

EXSURGENT-INFECTED PCS
It is possible for player characters infected with some
strains of the Exsurgent virus to continue on under
their own volition, even as the virus slowly consumes
them. This process is, quite naturally, horrifying in the
extreme, though there is little they can do about it.
Despite the best efforts of transhuman science, there
is very little that can be done to save an infected
person—the virus is simply too potent and adaptive.
As a result, standard Firewall policy is to terminate
the infected with extreme prejudice. Most Firewall
operatives are going to be aware of this, a fact which
pushes some of those who become infected to keep
their status a secret from their comrades.
   Both the haunting and xenomorph strains usually
transform a subject over time, meaning that the
character may initially not be aware of the infection.
This is a prime opportunity for the gamemaster to
mess with the character ruthlessly, starting slowly
with little haunting effects and building up as the
infection progresses. The character should slowly
become aware that they are under the influence of
something—something intelligent. Characters aware
of the Exsurgent virus and its effects will likely pick
up on this sooner, but the virus may prevent them
from doing anything about it. In effect, the character
becomes a prisoner within their own body, a body
they now share with a cold and malevolent pres-
ence that is methodically taking them over. Such
characters may respond in a number of ways de-
pending on their personality, ranging from despair,
withdrawal, and suicidal tendencies to complete
hysteria or calm acceptance. Most importantly,
however, their personality should begin to change
as the virus continues to transform them. Players
should be encouraged to take on new demeanors
and motivations, refl ecting the alien component
of their changing personality, with some guidance
from the gamemaster. This presents some intrigu-
ing roleplaying opportunities that the players will
hopefully embrace. If the gamemaster feels that the
player is not adequately representing the changing
mindset, however, the transformation can simply
be accelerated and the character converted into a
gamemaster-operated NPC.

EXSURGENTS
A few examples of exsurgents created from tran-
shumans transformed by the xenomorph strain of
the virus are noted below. As always, gamemasters
are encouraged to develop their own, using these as
guidelines. Unless otherwise noted, exsurgents use the
stats and skills of the transformed character. Each ex-
surgent detailed below first lists the aptitude modifiers
applied to transformed characters, then gives example
aptitude/skill ratings for NPC exsurgents.
  Note that simply encountering transformed exsur-
gents is stressful to the minds of many transhumans.
At the gamemaster’s discretion, such encounters may
inflict 1d10 + 3 mental stress (p. 215).

CREEPERS (SYNTHMORPHS)
Perhaps the most disturbing exsurgent variant, so-
called creepers are cloud-like amorphous swarms of
small, black bubbles that are strangely fuzzily defined,
as if surrounded by some sort of visual refraction effect.
These clouds are theorized to in fact be autonomous
femtobot swarms—similar to nanobots, but affecting
matter on an even smaller scale, at the level of an atomic
nucleus. These black bubbles are capable of coalescing
into physical shapes in various states and can penetrate
just about any material or substance in a matter of
Action Turns. They may even penetrate morphs, access-
ing and interfacing with neural and electronic systems
directly. For rules purposes, treat creepers the same as a
self-replicating nanoswarm (p. 383).

JELLIES (BIOMORPH)
These exsurgents resemble collections of massive, slimy,
mucus-filled bubbles. Their soft, amorphous shape
allows jellies to squeeze, slide, and slither through
even tiny spaces. Jellies are equipped with a number
of “limbs” that resemble long meaty tongues studded
with hard fleshy spikes that provide excellent gripping
ability. The lubricating coating that envelopes jellies is
both toxic and slightly corrosive, melting plastics and
biological materials after a half hour of exposure. This
substance may also be “spit” at targets.

  standard kinetic weapon and blade attacks.

SHIFTERS (SYNTHMORPH)
Shifters are synthmorphs whose material frames have
been converted to an exotic smart matter liquid metal.
This shapeshifting material can stabilize as a hardened
metallic shell or liquefy and reshape itself into other
forms. This allows the shifter to reflow its shell in a
matter of seconds, enabling it to visually mimic other
forms, including biomorphs (though they are easily
detectable as synthmorphs at other wavelengths or by
touch). Shifters may also reshape parts of their shell
into melee weapons such as knives or clubs.

SNAPPERS (SYNTHMORPHS)
Snapper exsurgents are typically crafted from vehicles
or other large synthetic shells or by melding multiple
synthmorphs together. They take the form of an in-
sectoid multi-segmented hexagonal tube with multiple
sets of limbs, three apiece, set radially 120 degrees
around the torso. These limbs are heavy, double-
jointed, and articulated with three joints. Each limb
ends in either a triad of manipulatory digits or a larger
pincer-like claw.

WHIPPERS (BIOMORPH)
These small barrel-shaped creatures have a mass
of small legs under their trunk that allows for fast
movement. At the top of their trunk is another mass
of 3-meter long, strong, whip-like tentacles. Some
of these tentacles feature gripping surfaces for grab-
bing and holding (both for tool use and mobility),
while others are sharp-edged and useful for slicing
through opponents.

WRAPPERS (BIOMORPH)
These exsurgents resemble large, thin, four-armed,
spiny starfish, capable of walking in a quadruped
manner, though they are seemingly better adapted for
microgravity. A large circular mouth resides in their
middle on one side and each arm ends in small sharp-
clawed digits, useful for climbing and tool use. Small
vent sacs allow for thrusting in microgravity and
sensory bands on the upper part of each arm provide
low-frequency hearing and infrared-equivalent sens-
ing. Their name comes from their tendency to drop on
opponents from above, wrapping themselves around
the head and arms.

EXSURGENT PSI
In addition to psi-chi and psi-gamma (see Psi, p. 220),
exsurgents have access to a third level of psi ability
(the Psi trait at Level 3), known as psi-epsilon. Psi-
epsilon is theorized to allow a level of interaction with
the underlying physics of reality that is beyond the
comprehension of transhuman science. Though some
Firewall scientists have speculated about the ma-
nipulation of dark energy or the Higgs field and Higgs
boson particles and similar exotic ideas, the truth is
that psi epsilon represents an understanding of science
so far advanced and so alien that transhumanity can
only guess at its mechanics.

EXSURGENT SYNTHMORPHS AND PSI
Exsurgents in synthetic morphs that were transformed
via nanoplague may use psi, despite lacking a biologi-
cal brain. Through some unknown mechanism, the
infecting nanobots are able to simulate a biological
brain’s effects. This feature, however, also makes them
vulnerable to psi use by others.

EXSURGENT PSI STRAIN
Exsurgents with Level 3 psi (psi-gamma) do not suffer
strain when using psi. Instead, they draw requisite
energy from the environment around them. In game
terms, this means that gamemasters do not need to
worry about rolling strain for exsurgent sleights. On a
cinematic level, it also allows the gamemaster to add cre-
ative environmental details to exsurgent psi use: sucking
the warmth out of the air, killing the lights, withering
plants, draining power from nearby electronics, killing
small creatures or insects, lowering air pressure, etc.

EXSURGENT PSI-GAMMA SLEIGHTS
These sleights are available to exsurgents with the
Level 2 Psi trait.

DECEREBRATION
   PSI TYPE:    Active        ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:       Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)
    STRAIN MOD: +2            SKILL:    Psi Assault
This sleight temporarily “shorts out” a portion of the
subject’s brain stem. The victim’s cerebral functions
and motor activity become severely impaired; apply
a –30 modifier to all actions. If an Excellent Suc-
cess is scored, the target effectively loses all cerebral
functioning, including vision, hearing, other sensory
functions, and mesh use. Their muscles and limbs also
tense and become rigid, essentially paralyzing them in
what looks like an agonized state.

ONSLAUGHT
   PSI TYPE:    Active        ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:       Touch         DURATION:   Temp (Action Turns)
   STRAIN MOD: +0            SKILL:   Psi Assault
  This offensive sleight floods the target’s mind with
sensory input and thought processes that are so alien
and disturbing that they inflict 1d10 + (WIL ÷ 10,
round up) mental stress. Increase the stress by +5 if an
Excellent Success is scored.

SCENARIO
   PSI TYPE:    Active       ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:       Touch        DURATION:   Sustained
    STRAIN MOD: +2            SKILL:    Control
This sleight hijacks the target’s sensorium, replacing
it with a virtual scenario controlled by the exsurgent.
The effect is much like being jacked into a simulspace
scenario, albeit against the target’s will. While the
exsurgent cannot harm the target in the scenario, they
can learn something about the person’s behavioral
responses to certain situations. While under the in-
fluence of this sleight, the target is cut off from their
physical senses (–60 to any Perception Tests), but they
may flail about and otherwise respond physically to
events in the scenario, which may cause them to hurt
themselves and will make them seem crazy to onlook-
ers. Targets may attempt to ignore the scenario and
concentrate on the real world, but this requires a WIL
Test each Action Turn and they suffer a –30 modifier
from disorientation even if they succeed.

STRIP MEMORY/SKILL
   PSI TYPE:    Active       ACTION:     Complex
   RANGE:       Touch        DURATION:   Temp (Hours)
    STRAIN MOD:     +2        SKILL:    Psi Assault
Strip allows the exsurgent to suppress certain memo-
ries in the target’s mind. This can be used to block
memories of certain events or even the victim’s iden-
tity. The process is not exact, however, and so the
memories may not be fully suppressed and/or related
memories may also be blocked; the gamemaster de-
cides on the effect as determined by the MoS. Strip can
also be used to temporarily erase a specific skill from
the target’s mind, preventing them from using or even
defaulting to that ability while so affected.

EXSURGENT PSI-EPSILON SLEIGHTS
Psi-epsilon is available to exsurgents with the Psi trait
at Level 3. This subset of psi involves abilities that can
affect the underlying physical nature of the universe,
creating localized reality-altering effects. Psi manipu-
lation on this level is extremely dangerous and should
have the potential of disastrous consequences, given
that these manipulations violate fundamental laws of
nature and sometimes create paradoxes between the
forces that glue the universe together. Gamemasters
are also encouraged to treat critical failures as appro-
priately critical.
   Given these factors, psi-epsilon should only be
accessible to powerful adversaries and used as a
gamemaster tool with extreme precaution. The exact
mechanics of psi-epsilon sleights are left wide-open,
however, for whatever use the gamemaster can

%%% txt/374.txt
dream of. Their intent is to be more cinematic than
mechanical, so gamemasters should wing rules effects
as needed. This is an open opportunity for the game-
master to create nightmarish monsters from beyond
with frightening reality-ripping and mind-scarring
abilities. While some example sleights are provided
below, gamemasters are encouraged to modify their
effects and to create their own.
  At the gamemaster’s discretion, simply observing psi
epsilon sleights in action may inflict 1d10 + 2 mental
stress on a character (p. 215).

ANTI-ELECTRONICS FIELD
All electronics within Close range of the exsurgent
mysteriously fail as if electrical power is simply ne-
gated. This effectively disables synthmorphs and pods
and leaves other characters without access to their
devices or implants.

CASIMIR FORCE REPULSION
This sleight exploits the Casimir effect (an interaction
between the electromagnetic fields of different objects)
on a macro-scale, allowing the exsurgent to levitate
themself or other objects by creating repulsing fields.
This could also allow the exsurgent to push targets
away, pin them against walls, etc.

CRYOKINESIS
This sleight allows the exsurgent to drain all heat from
an area, down to absolute zero, effectively freezing
everything within range and inflicting cold damage on
unprotected characters.

DIFFUSION
This sleight diffuses light, laser, and particle beams, ef-
fectively making them useless as weapons, or at least
impairing the DV they inflict.

KINETIC FRICTION
The exsurgent uses this sleight to increase the fric-
tion applied to kinetic activities. This has a negligible
effect on most activities, but high-velocity projectiles
like firearms and railguns will be significantly slowed,
decreasing their DV by half or more.

MATTER TRANSFORMATION
This sleight alters the molecular bonds and atomic
components of a targeted material, causing it to either
weaken and deteriorate or transmutate into some
other physical substance. This can also be used to
alter the molecular state of a material, causing gases
to condense, solids to liquefy, etc. An exsurgent could
use this to weaken a door or other barrier, condense a
solid bridge out of liquid, petrify organic materials, etc.

NEGATIVE REFRACTION
The exsurgent redirects electromagnetic waves with
this sleight, refracting them around their body, with
the same effect as the invisibility cloak (p. 316).
PYROKINESIS
Similar to cryokinesis, this sleight enables the exsur-
gent to accelerate the molecules, increase friction, or
focus heat in a specific area, causing materials to ignite
or smolder.



THE FACTORS
The alien species known as the Factors are unlike
anything mankind has encountered so far (see First
Contact: The Factors, p. 40). Though they are aloof
and stand-offish, their willingness and sometimes ea-
gerness to deal with (parts of) transhumanity indicate
either a keen interest on their part in transhuman
affairs or some hidden ulterior agenda. Though the
various transhuman factions have been similarly wary
and cautious, and despite numerous communications
difficulties and failures, an uneasy relationship has
flowered over the past 8 years, facilitating some trade
and exchange of knowledge.

ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION
The Factors have remained notoriously tight-lipped
about their origins, history, and the location of their
homeworld. Though they have also paid visits to some
of transhumanity’s exoplanet colonies, no gatecrashing
expeditions have yet found any sign of Factor habitation
or passing elsewhere in the galaxy. Repeated inquiries
by transhuman mediators have been simply ignored or
answered in cryptic terms that have yet to be deciphered.
  The Factor home world is in fact an Earth-like
planet with comparable atmospheric conditions and
a prevalent hydrosphere but with longer periods of
darkness (due to slower rotation of the planet and a
less-luminous orange giant). While adapted transhu-
mans could find their planet habitable, their abiogen-
esis (the formation of life from self-replicating, but
not-living molecules) took a different route than life
on Earth.
  The Factors’ primordial ancestors began in their
planet’s early geological history as a type of of pho-
tosynthesizer that ate carbon dioxide and water and
released oxygen, also obtaining energy from inorganic
chemicals like hydrogen sulfide. Long conditions
without direct light on their homeworld, however,
spurred the success of organisms that could survive
by acquiring energy in other ways. The next evolu-
tionary leap was to a stage similar to Terran slime
molds, eating microorganisms from decaying matter.
As evolution progressed, they mutated further into a
cautious, predatory species that fed on larger, danger-
ous creatures. Rather than actively hunting such prey,
this species developed versatile methods of capturing
and immobilizing their competitors (comparable to
Earth’s funnel web or trapdoor spiders). Over time,
this method of trapping prey spurred basic (practical)
intelligence and provided them with the evolutionary
advantage that paved the way to sapience, driving
Factors to become the highest developed organisms
on their planet and build a civilization.

%%% txt/375.txt
   Like mankind, the Factors suffered through and
survived their own singularity event and encounter
with the Exsurgent virus. Perhaps due to their cau-
tious and calculating nature—and their evolutionary
experience in dealing with more powerful and danger-
ous opponents—the Factors are resolutely determined
not to make any similar mistakes as a species.

XENOBIOLOGY
Since life on the Factors’ home world developed
differently than Earth and produced neither nucleic
acids nor amino acids, Factor metabolic processes
and “genetics” are very different from transhuman-
ity’s. While little is known about the exact physiology
of the Factors, due to the lack of captured or dead
specimens to investigate (so far, no hypercorps or fac-
tions have risked an interstellar incident by abducting
one to dissect … so far) and their unwillingness to be
examined by transhumans, most common knowledge
about them is based on observational and forensics
research during their encounters with transhumanity.

INDIVIDUAL FACTORS
 Individual Factors resemble non-translucent ambu-
 latory amoeba, slime molds, or slugs. Though they
“stand” only 0.3 meters tall, their body diameter
 ranges from 1.5 to 2 meters, they can be up to 2
 meters long, and they can shape their body to change
 these dimensions. Instead of walking, they crawl or
 ooze from place to place by protruding finger-like
 structures (so called pseudopodia) that attach to the
 ground (or wall or ceiling) and which they use to pull
and retract their rear forward (similar to cell migra-
tion). Due to their malleable shape they are not as
strongly affected by gravity as transhumans.
   Most Factors that have been encountered are dull
ocher in color and are made from a gooey, gel-like
substance of unknown composition, though yellow
glistening patches (which are temporary organelles)
and bundles of fibers (some kind of muscular skel-
eton) often become visible when they move. While
all Factors are able to express versatile pseudopodia
to manipulate and operate devices (and even attack),
some subspecies possess, carry, or are able to develop
additional differentiated limbs, cilia, or organs with
specialized functions.

FACTOR COLONIES
Unlike transhumans, Factors rarely act individually—
in fact, individuality is a concept somewhat foreign
to Factors. Most Factors join together into a collec-
tive unit termed a colony. A typical Factor colony is
composed of hundreds or thousands of individual
Factors that literally physically join together into a
mass organism (resembling more a primordial soup
than a gargantuan Factor). Individual Factors are
indistinguishable from each other when merged into
the supra-structure of the colony, though individuals
can form and break apart to accomplish different
tasks. This colonial merging is mainly possible due
to the fact that Factors don’t possess differentiated
and specialized organs or cell types that need to be
segregated from each other, but instead use an open
system of local, temporary gradients for regulation.

%%% txt/376.txt
Neurofilament connections effectively allow the
Factor colony to operate with a group mind-state,
with supercomputer potential. This also allows for the
easy transfer of knowledge and memories to all other
factors within a colony.
   If dismembered, blown apart, or otherwise sepa-
rated, individual Factors in a colony can regenerate
and reconstitute at a rapid rate without loss of ability
or memory.
   Factors reproduce when different members of the
colony produce gametes that fuse, grow into spore
stalks, and emit spores that later hatch and grow clones.

BIODIVERSITY AND SELF-DESIGN
Factors colonies are known for their high biodiversity,
featuring numerous sub-groups (so called phenotypes)
that each have unique traits (cilia, apocrine glands, car-
apace-like outer membrane) that give them an ecologi-
cal advantage or a utilitarian aptitude for certain tasks.
These traits are not random evolutionary features, but
are the result of intentional bio-engineering. The Fac-
tors have a strong grip on their own metabolisms and
genetic expressions and can draw on an array of ge-
netic building blocks and biotech techniques to modify
themselves rapidly and massively to adapt to special
conditions. Whether these modifications might have a
purpose beyond function, such as for reproduction or
self-expression, is currently unknown.

METABOLISM
Factors ships and habitats have transhuman-friendly
atmospheres with a slightly higher content of carbon
dioxide and less nitrogen that mimics the conditions
on the Factors’ home planet. They don’t breathe
oxygen via lungs but absorb it via their outer “skin.”
Since they can also use oxygen from other sources
(minerals, liquids like water, and salts) to fuel their
aerobic energy production (i.e., respiration), they can
be considered functional anaerobes, meaning they can
survive in environments without atmosphere, though
they must usually supply themselves with food in
order to do so.
  During the few ceremonial festivities to which
Factors were invited and actually attended, they
consumed and processed transhuman organic food
by internalization. On the first occasion, dishes and
dinnerware were absorbed as well due to misunder-
standing, but were excreted unharmed after the or-
ganic components the factors could utilize had been
broken down.
  While Factors are omnivores similar to transhumans,
they prefer immobilized live prey, which they enjoy
absorbing internally and digesting, excreting those
parts that cannot be used to fuel their metabolism.
As such they can devour biomorphs and non-metallic
components of synthmorphs.

PERCEPTION
Factors don’t perceive the world as transhumans
do. They (usually) don’t possess visual or acoustic
organs to see or hear but have a number of sensory
organs that grant them a 360-degree awareness of
their surroundings and enable them to interact
with their environment similar to or in some cases
even better than transhumans do. Their perception
spectra includes the infrared part of the electromag-
netic spectrum, magnetoception, a high resolution
chemical-gradient based “sight,” and keen haptic
perceptions (including vibrations).

COMMUNICATION
Due to the lack of a vocal system, Factors use different
methods of signaling and communication. Factors in
physical contact exchange information by juxtacrine
cellular, neurofilament interfacing, or by merging for
information transfer. Over distance, Factors signal via
pheromonal communication using airborne scents or
chemical signals with different metabolic components.
Nicknamed “Factor dust,” this communication is ef-
fective even over great distances (up to 10 kilometers).
Factor dust does have an odor perceptible to transhu-
mans, however, that ranges from smelly to unbearable.
This dust is also toxic in high concentrations and some-
times used as an offensive or defensive mechanism.
  To date, transhumans have failed to develop a device
that can analyze the Factors’ chemical effluvia and
translate it into something understandable, due to the
lack of a conceptual matrix (though certain “moods”
have been identified). Instead, all communication
between the Factors and transhumanity is mediated
through computer interfaces. Certain Factor pheno-
types that deal with transhumanity have grown a a
neurobiological interface (or organ) that enables them
to wirelessly mesh with transhuman computer systems.
   Long distance communication between Factors
and transhumanity is achieved by normal means of
farcasting communication. There are strong indica-
tions that Factors also take advantage of quantum-
entanglement communications as well, enabling
Factor colonies and ships to share knowledge gained
in different parts of the galaxy.

EXOSOCIOLOGY
Factors are cooperative beings that exist as a collec-
tive colonial organization. Though they can oper-
ate individually from the colony, they tend to view
themselves as part of that collective entity rather than
an individual being. Multiple colonies often work to-
gether as a higher functional unit (a lattice), like some
kind of superorganism. These lattices enable the po-
tential for collective networking and bioinformation
exchange on a scope beyond anything transhumanity
is capable of.
   These colonies should not be considered the same
as the hive mind social hierarchies of Terran insects.
Factor colonies do not feature the same division of
labor and instead function according to a consensus-
based sort of groupthink. Individual Factors have no
sense of personal gain or property and share equally
with other Factors and colonies.

%%% txt/377.txt
   Factors do not experience emotions in the same
manner that transhumans do, though being evolved
creatures they are driven by certain instincts. They
know and understand many of the same concepts that
transhumans do thanks to evolution, such as competi-
tion/rivalry and altruism/cooperation. They also enjoy
an understanding of basic ideas of philosophy such as
aesthetics and metaphysics, though their conception of
such topics is likely to differ from transhuman notions.

ART AND CULTURE
 Due to their perceptual array, Factor “art” (creations
 and expressions that are appealing or attractive to
 their senses) is mostly chemical or tactile-based. It
 can induce certain “mood” responses from individual
 Factors and whole colonies, ranging from agitated
 jittering and release of a Factor dust interpretable as
“joy” to a tensing and solidifying of the whole body
 (and no chemical expulsion) that seems to relate to
 anger. Since they like and are susceptible to delicate
 compositions of different chemicals, certain bouquets
 and fragrances from liquids or volatiles such as wines
 and perfumes are both appealing and repulsive to
 Factors. The same is also true for the natural smells
 of biomorphs, meaning that Factors may respond in
 a more friendly or hostile manner depending on a
 particular transhuman’s scent.
    Factors do not comprehend most transhuman art,
 as it is mostly visual or auditory based (e.g., music,
 painting), though they do seem to have an apprecia-
 tion for engineering, architecture, and some sculpture.
While they have expressed interest in digitalized media
 out of a curiosity (or plan) to understand transhuman
 mindsets, they lack the organs and mental structure to
 access and comprehend it.

TECHNOLOGY
Though the Factors repeatedly express dismay at
transhumanity’s low level of technology, they have
failed so far to produce technology that is exception-
ally far in advance. Some believe that the Factors are
simply hiding their advanced technology in order to
keep transhumans from stealing or copying it, while
others believe this may simply be a posture taken
by the Factors to facilitate bargaining. The Factors
also claim that their technology would not interest
transhumans because of their differences in physiol-
ogy and mindset, and what little technology they
have displayed is certainly specialized for Factor use
(specialized neurofilament links, chemical signaling
and Factor dust interfaces, etc.) and so unusable to
most transhumans. The Factors have traded some
technology to transhumans, at expensive cost, though
the small sampling provided so far seems to have
originated from alien species with physiologies more
akin to transhumans.
   It is interesting to note that scans of Factor ships
indicate their technology level, aside from the drives,
is not all that more advanced than transhumanity.
Also of note is that no two Factor ships have been
alike, spurring some to believe that the Factors are
in fact making use of ships acquired from other alien
species—perhaps abandoned derelicts that the Factors
recovered and restored. Once again this has led some
to believe that the Factors are using what to them are
primitive craft in order to hide their real technology,
while others are of the opinions that the Factors are
simply scavengers and opportunists, piggybacking on
the developments of other alien species.
   One interesting feature of Factor technology is that
they use no artificial intelligences. This stems from
their own singularity experience. Instead, Factors use
infomorph versions of themselves or the accumulated
processing power of their colony mind-states to per-
form major computerized tasks.

FACTOR MOTIVATIONS
The driving reason behind why the Factors made con-
tact with transhumanity remains unclear and is open to
gamemaster interpretation. There is much speculation
among transhuman factions. Some think the Factors
are simply social creatures who are glad to make con-
tact with another post-singularity surviving civilization.
Others believe the Factors are mercenary traders who
somehow acquired FTL travel and use it to their full
advantage, fleecing various trading partners who lack
such capabilities (thus also explaining why the Factors
eschew the Pandora Gates—they disdain competition).
Still others worry about secret, hidden motivations.
   Despite claiming to represent a number of alien
civilizations, the Factors have been extremely reluc-
tant to provide any other information on these other
species or even to say how many there are. More
recently, however, they have expressed a willingness
to transport a small number of transhumans to other
civilizations, though at great expense and with no
guarantee to their safety or ability to return.
   So far, the Factors have made no mention of the
ETI or the Exsurgent virus to transhumanity, though
they are aware of their existence. Instead they have
simply issued dire warning and admonitions regarding
the development of seed AIs and use of the Pandora
Gates. The Factors have in fact expressed an extreme
reluctance to deal with any transhuman factions that
are heavily invested in gatecrashing, such as Gate-
keeper Corp.

THE FACTORS IN GAME
Factors should be rarely encountered in Eclipse Phase.
Most of their interactions with transhumanity occur
remotely and infrequently. It is uncommon for them to
risk direct interactions. It should be kept in mind that
Factors are cautious to the point of being conserva-
tive and view transhumanity as potentially hostile or
dangerous, so they are more likely to act with discre-
tion than boldness. Factors are also quite cunning,
having evolved from prey-capturing predators, and
still design complex machinations (traps in the meta-
phorical sense) to achieve their goals. In other words,
Factors out to achieve something are likely to hatch an

%%% txt/378.txt
ROLEPLAYING FACTORS
 When roleplaying Factors, their alien mindset
 and lack of individualism should be kept in mind.
“I” is a designation that does not exist in Factor
 terminology. Factors always use the plural when
 referring to themselves, usually referring to
 either their colony, lattice, or entire species. It is
 quite common for conceptual discrepancies to
 occur between transhumans and Factors due to
 the different sensory perceptions of each species.
 Factors do not “see” the way most transhumans
 do, nor do they “hear.”
    Communication with Factors should be chal-
 lenging for several reasons. While computer-
 based communication has enabled both species
 to talk to each other, there is no direct transla-
 tion and certain concepts held by one species are
 simply incomprehensible or untranslatable by the
 other. Conversation should therefore be mislead-
 ing and provide ambiguous information.
    When describing spaceships and habitats, the
 physiology of the Factors should be considered.
The Factors’ malleable form and ability to extend
 pseudopodial limbs enables them to fit into most
 places and operate transhuman devices (even
 pilot a transhuman vehicle by “hand”). The same
 is not true in reverse, however—most Factor
 devices are unusable to transhumans, as they lack
 the ability for chemical signaling.                 ■



  elaborate plot to get it and are not against recruiting
  transhumans. Also, drawing on their abilities to self-
  modify themselves and technology developed on their
  own or picked up at other places in the universe, they
  can adapt to new situations very quickly.

  ALIEN MINDSET
  Factors don’t possess Lucidity stats and cannot be
  driven to madness like transhumans.
    Affecting Factors with psi is very difficult, as noted
  on p. 222. As of yet, Factors have not exhibited any
  psi abilities of their own.

  FACTOR COMBAT
  Factors usually avoid direct combat but can defend
  themselves if they have to. They are only likely to act
  aggressively in situations where they have surprise,
  environmental or technological advantages, and/or
  superior numbers. Due to their cooperativism, Fac-
  tors are rarely encountered alone, working en masse
  to eliminate potential threats.
     Immunity to Kinetic Damage: Due to their gooey
  composition and non-differentiated physiology, kinet-
  ic weapons (firearms, railguns) are not very damaging
  to Factors. Most such projectiles pass through their
  gelatinous bodies, inflicting minor damage via hydro-
  static shock. The holes left by such weapons quickly
close in a matter of seconds. Likewise, cuts left by
blades rapidly seal. In game terms, both such weapons
inflict the minimum amount of damage possible.
   Regeneration: Even if damaged, Factors regenerate
very quickly. They heal SOM ÷ 10 (round up) damage
every Action Turn. Wounds may not be healed this
way, however.

FACTOR COMPUTERS
Due to using completely alien protocols and system
designs, Factor computers are essentially impossible
to hack. They do, however, employ some devices that
emulate transhuman computer systems for communi-
cation purposes, and these may be hacked as normal.

FACTOR DUST TOXIN
As noted above, Factors can deploy a type of chemical
Factor dust that is is toxic to transhumans. Treat this
as an area effect (cone) attack.
Type: Bio
Application: Inh
Onset Time: 1 Action Turn
Duration: 10 minutes (5 with medichines)
Effect: Severe coughing and respiratory distress, 1d10
  damage per Action Turn for 5 Action Turns (or on-
  going with continuous exposure), –20 to all actions
  for 2 hours. Medichines reduce damage by half and
  modifier duration to 15 minutes.

MELDING
Individual Factors may merge together to form larger
units, much like masses of Factors form colonies. In
game terms, use the highest stat possessed by the
melded Factors, +2 for each additional Factor up to a
maximum of +10. Durability (and Wound Thresholds)
are added together.

FACTOR PHENOTYPES
A few examples of the different Factor phenotypes are
described below.

AMBASSADORS
The ambassador Factor phenotypes are the ones who
most commonly handle direct interactions with tran-
shumanity. Most likely to put transhumans at ease,
these Factors feature a section of sensor nodules that
loosely approximate a “face.”

THE IKTOMI
Little is known about the alien race known as the
Iktomi except for the ancient ruins they left behind
on Echo V (p. 109). No Iktomi specimens have been
found so far, though certain architectural remains
suggest a predilection for web-like structures. This
has been bolstered by certain other features and relics
which suggest these aliens had a segmented, multi-
legged, arthropod-type form—thus their given name,
after a Native American spider god.
   What is clear is that the Iktomi suffered through
some sort of cataclysmic event that wiped out their
civilization. The nature of this event has yet to be de-
termined, but it raises concerns for many researchers.
Having suffered through its own near-apocalypse, it
is not comforting for transhumanity to find evidence
that other alien species did not.
   Though the Iktomi are likely long extinct, the rem-
nants of their civilizations presents a plot hook for
gamemasters to use for building scenarios. Perhaps
evidence is uncovered of Iktomi settlements in other
star systems, and the characters are sent to investigate
or a relic is unearthed that suggests the Iktomi fell
prey to some danger that now threaten transhumanity.



THE PANDORA GATES
The five known Pandora Gates (see Opening Pandora’s
Gate, p. 46) all look and operate in a similar fashion,
though they vary wildly in terms of size, shape, and
available destinations. The gates are built from some
sort of stable exotic matter whose full atomic struc-
ture scientists haven’t come close to cracking. To touch
and sight, however, the gates appear to be constructed
from a timeless-seeming polished black metal with no
signs of aging or wear and tear. Something about the
gates’ physical composition makes them difficult to
look at, as if the viewer cannot quite focus on their
outlines. Some onlookers have reported feelings of
vertigo and nausea, while others have insisted that the
gate outlines move on the edges of their visions, as if
the lines are reflowing or the edges are vibrating at
high frequencies. Due to this disturbing feature, most
gate sites keep the actual gate structures covered.
   Structurally, the gates themselves are partially
enclosed by an irregular spherical cage composed of
black arms that are bent and angled in unusual ways
and sometimes interlocking. When new wormhole
location is programmed into the gate, these arms
physically change shape, move, and reflow around
the spherical gate area (suggesting they are made of
some sort of programmable matter). The openings
between arms are sometimes only large enough for
a transhuman to enter, while others are large enough
to allow a freight train of supplies to pass through.
In many cases, large vehicles or equipment must be
dismantled, carried through, and reassembled on the

%%% txt/380.txt
other side. It is suspected that the gate size could be
programmable, but so far efforts to do so have failed.
  All known gates within the solar system are located
on the surface of naturally occurring astronomical
bodies, be that a planet, moon, asteroid, or so on.
None have yet been found without such a land-based
connection (e.g., floating in space or in the upper
atmosphere of a gas giant), though such gates have
been found in other star systems. It is speculated that
gates could be physically moved, but no one is will-
ing to risk such an endeavor given the lesson learned
when the Go-nin Group messed too heavily with the
Discord Gate’s controls (see Eris, p. 109).
  The arms comprising each gate’s spherical cage have
an abnormal-looking organic-seeming growth on their
exterior surface in some areas, patterned in entranc-
ing twists, curves, and whorls that in fact adhere to
perfect mathematical formulas. It took some time for
scientists to discover that this growth was in fact the
gate’s control systems, or so-called “black box.” The
interface developed to interact with this system is what
allows gate controllers to manipulate gate functions.

THE WORMHOLE
When the gates themselves are open, a sphere appears
within the central area that is not so much black as
pure nothingness. This sphere of darkness projects an
aura of charged energy, and in fact ripples of green
arc lightning cascade across its surface. Anyone or
anything entering that sphere comes out the other side
of the wormhole, through a similar gate, seemingly
instantaneously. An unknown force field effect seems
to prevent the atmospheres from the two connected
gates from interacting.
   Exactly how this wormhole is created is something
that remains outside of transhumanity’s comprehen-
sion. The generally accepted theory is that each gate
acts as an anchor, allowing the fabric of space-time
to be folded so that two such anchored places can
be brought together, ripping a hole open between
them so that a person can simply step through. It is
unclear whether or not these wormholes are all pre-
existing, created when the gate was first established,
or whether each wormhole is manufactured whenever
the gate is activated.
   Other more radical theories on how the gates func-
tion exist, though these are usually discounted as far
less likely. One such theory suggests that the worm-
holes created are actually only zero-width Planck-
scale connections across space-time and that no matter
is actually transferred—only information. Instead, this
theory suggests that anyone or anything entering the
wormhole is in fact instantaneously scanned and dis-
assembled and then their informational blueprint is
transmitted as information across space to the other
gate, which immediately reassembles an exact copy
using some sort of powerfully advanced nano- or fem-
totechnology. Very little evidence supports this theory,
however, and the disturbing implications it represents
raises fierce opposition.
OPERATIONS
Only a few people know that the Prometheans played
a key role in developing the interface for the gate con-
trol systems, achieving breakthroughs in understand-
ing that transhumanity was incapable of achieving on
its own. Regardless of their help, however, the gate
controls have proven difficult, complex, and danger-
ous to use. Through trial and error—and numerous
horrible accidents—the procedures for gate operation
have become somewhat normalized and standardized,
though unexpected complications are par for the
course.
   Each gate can be programmed to open to numerous
extrasolar locations. In fact, each gate seems to have
a pre-programmed “library” of destinations. New
gate connections can be “dialed up” from this built-in
list, though there is nothing that indicates what the
far side of the gate will be like. Old gate connections
are closed when a new one is dialed up. Extrasolar
gate locations have ranged from habitable planets
and moons to deep space to truly deadly environ-
ments such as the crushing gravities and poisonous
atmospheres of gas giants and the coronas of stars.
Researchers have attempted to distill some sort of rec-
ognizable pattern by the manner in which locations
are listed and categorized, to no avail. Complicating
matters, there is some evidence that suggests that the
destination libraries sometimes change. More than
once operators have been unable to recall the codes
for previously accessed destinations, leading to the
loss of several gatecrashing teams and colonies.
   Entering a gate is like walking through a door,
though it’s impossible to see anything beyond the
gate’s surface. One moment you’re entering the black
sphere at your starting location and instantaneously
you’re exiting the sphere at your destination location.
The true nature of the black sphere at the center of
each gate is wildly speculated upon, and almost every
gatecrasher describes a different textual experience.

GATECRASHING
The various hypercorps and factions in control of a
Pandora Gate engage in active exploration of extra-
solar systems—an activity termed gatecrashing. The
interests and procedures vary, but the Gatekeeper
Corporation (and to a lesser extent TerraGenesis
and Pathfinder) both recruit heavily for expedition
personnel. Given the high casualty and death rates
involved, finding qualified personnel can be difficult.
There are more than enough infugees, poor, desperate,
or thrill-seeking individuals willing to risk their lives
if give the opportunity, however, no matter what their
motivations. Gatekeeper operates a lottery system,
whereby willing adventurers can sign up in the hope
of their name being pulled to be sent on an expedition
to a foreign point in space. Such gatecrashers must
sign away all rights to any discoveries they may make
to Gatekeeper, however, though the corp provides not
insignificant rewards for certain discoveries, such as
key resources, alien artifacts, or new life. One potent

%%% txt/381.txt
prize has yet to be claimed: finding a living, sapient
alien life form.
   In contrast, the Love and Rage anarchist collective
operating the Fissure Gate on Uranus makes the gate
available to anyone who schedules time to use it, as-
suming their Rep is good and they aren’t acting with
commercial interests in mind. Any discoveries made
via the Fissure Gate must be openly shared. The draw-
back to using the Fissure Gate is that the anarchists’
resources are limited. Gatecrashing operations are
handled in a DIY manner, meaning that the operators
may not be able to provide the support that certain
expeditions need.
   Resourceful parties may also rent gate time via
Gatekeeper or one of the other hypercorp-controlled
gates, though this tends to cost a small fortune. The
more a group is willing to pay, however, the more time
and support they will get.
   When establishing an opening to a new location,
several precautionary measures are taken. First, the
gate area itself is evacuated and cordoned off with
a defensive security perimeter, just in case anything
hostile comes through. Then drones are moved in to
push a micro fiberoptic camera through the gate to
view what is on the other side. This is followed by a
larger sensor package, evaluating environmental con-
ditions. If the environment is not hostile, a tethered
drone is then sent through to explore the far gate en-
virons, trailing a hardwired connection back through
the gate.
   For gatecrashing expeditions, these procedures are
often rushed—to the hypercorps operating the gate,
time is valuable. Each second wasted on a gatecrash-
ing expedition is one less second they can use estab-
lishing a new colony or exploiting a new world of its
resources. Indeed, it is common for a connection to be
closed when a gatecrashing expedition is sent through,
to be dialed up at a later scheduled time for retrieval,
so as not to waste gate operations on an idle connec-
tion. Many a gatecrashing team has failed to check-in
at their appointed pickup time.
   Most of the gate-controlling entities have estab-
lished a system and infrastructure for making regular
connections to extrasolar colonies and ferrying ma-
chinery and supplies through. Often this is handled by
establishing very short connections, just enough time
for a few people to transfer back and forth and/or to
send a trainload of supplies through via tracks that
run right up to the gate.

ANOMALIES
Unfortunately for many unlucky gatecrashers, gate
transfers have proven to be both unstable and glitchy.
Sometimes gates open to locations different from what
is expected—and such new destinations are often hos-
tile environments. Numerous personnel have entered
one side of a gate only to never appear on the other
side, despite those before and after them transferring
through fine. On several occasions, wormhole con-
nections have crashed mid-operation, sometimes as
someone was stepping through, leaving them literally
split in two on different worlds. In other instances,
gate transfers have suffered horrible malfunctions,
resulting in gatecrashers coming through the other
side literally turned inside out, melded with their
equipment, or pulped as if by massive gravitational
forces. Some expeditions report that stepping through
a gate has interfered with their equipment, disabling
it or creating other problems. A few gatecrashers have
also reported losing memories after a gate transfer.
Most of these problems have been chalked up to dif-
ficult controls and an imperfect understanding of gate
functions, but some conspiracy theorists suggest that
outside forces may be influencing gate operations.
   While the experience of passing through is instan-
taneous from an outside observer’s perspective, many
gatecrashers report a subjective time lag, where it feels
as though minutes, days, or even weeks or months
pass before they exit. Reports have varied from
experiencing this period as a calm, meditative state
to spooky accounts of being lost in blackness and
surrounded by unseen whispering entities or more
hellish experiences of encountering monstrous pres-
ences. Though rare, some have passed through only to
collapse in a gibbering heap, their sanity ripped away.
A few report feeling that they have carried a presence
with them ever since ...
   While the gamemaster can make use of any of
these anomalies, they are also encouraged to use their
imagination to generate truly creepy and strange ex-
periences. At the same time, gamemasters shouldn’t
make such experiences so prevalent that the players
resist entering any gates or the novelty of such events
runs dry.



PROJECT OZMA
The origins of Project Ozma date to the first modern
SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) experi-
ments in the mid-20th century. That experiment—also
named Project Ozma—grew into a larger, international
concerted effort to try and locate and identify ETIs; a
myriad of projects blossomed during this time period,
all falling under the general SETI nomenclature. While
initially government funded, by the late 20th century
and early 21st century the work was primarily funded
by private sources.
  The first hypercorps to expand into space swal-
lowed SETI whole, revitalizing and re-focusing the
decades-old programs with newly emergent technolo-
gies, each in divergent areas to achieve a particular
hypercorps’ objectives. After all, if the bean counters
were going to authorize the spending of billions to
expand markets into space, they wanted assurances
that no little green monsters were waiting to destroy
future revenue streams.
  As with other organizations that survived the Fall,
the broad distribution of SETI projects between
multiple hypercorps guaranteed that personnel, tech-
nologies, and processes would survive, even if a given

%%% txt/382.txt
hypercorp did not. As the Planetary Consortium rose
in power, future-minded individuals in influential posi-
tions within the new order ensured that these divergent
projects were once again swallowed and put to work.
   During this transitional period, however, knowl-
edge of the Exsurgent virus’s existence emerged. All
of the various SETI projects were retasked as a unified
agency and renamed Project Ozma. While the virus’s
origins remained a mystery at the time, far too many
of the movers and shakers of the Consortium were
convinced that the Exsurgent virus represented first
contact. Project Ozma altered its focus from searching
for ETIs, transforming into a ready-response agency to
deal with first contact. As the true threat of the Exsur-
gent virus became known, Project Ozma was rapidly
elevated in scope and oversight authority, absorbing
numerous smaller agencies in the process. While the
nominal concepts of a SETI project remained in public
view, the completely transformed Project Ozma van-
ished from sight, turned into a highly classified black
budget operation, with very few even in the Planetary
Consortium aware of its presence or influence.
   Project Ozma now operates as the Planetary Con-
sortium’s high level threat assessment and response
organization with immense power and authority as
well as almost unlimited funding. Primarily focused
on extraterrestrials, in reality Project Ozma is tasked
with any potent threat to the Planetary Consortium
or its interests (which includes secret threat groups,
such as Firewall).

METHODS
Project Ozma’s internal structure is much different
from Firewall’s, being organized more like a tradition-
al black ops spy agency bureaucracy. While their field
operations are sometimes similar in the deployment
of teams to assess, contain, or erase threats, they also
have the resources and personnel to conduct more
long-term and extensive operations. It is likely that
Project Ozma operates behind numerous front groups,
from legitimate-seeming hypercorps to criminal syn-
dicates, and that they have influence within numerous
others. Given their connections and influence, Project
Ozma is far more capable of pulling strings behind the
scenes to get what they want, especially in the inner
system. When circumstances call for it, they are more
likely to pull out the big guns that Firewall is, using
their resources to call up communication blackouts,
memetic propaganda campaigns, and force sufficient
to wipe out entire habitats.
   Gamemasters should treat Project Ozma as the ulti-
mate Men-in-Black style government operation. They
are cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and capable of
hatching extensive long-term plots. Even in an age of
omnipresent surveillance, they have the means to op-
erate with complete secrecy and deniability. They also
have access to cutting-edge science and information
  PROJECT OZMA
  RUMORS
  Whether true or not, gamemasters can use the
  following rumors to help tailor Project Ozma for
  their campaign.

  • Project Ozma transcends even the Planetary
    Consortium’s authority, operating as a supra-
    governmental agency under the direction of
    the inner system’s inner circle of elites.
  • Project Ozma dealt with the Factors first, be-
    fore their presence was made known to the
    rest of transhumanity.
  • Project Ozma has captured a live Factor for
    their own experimental purposes.
  • Project Ozma is still in communication with and/
    or working for the TITANS.
  • Project Ozma has a pet TITAN under their
     control.
  • Project Ozma is behind the interdiction of Earth.
  • Project Ozma has their own secret
    Pandora Gate.
  • Project Ozma’s secret headquarters is on Earth.
  • Project Ozma agents have exhibited signs of
    Exsurgent infection.
  • Project Ozma has their own cadre of psi-capa-
    ble asyncs.                                   ■



that is classified beyond top secret. While the orga-
nization’s primary motivation is the protection of
the Planetary Consortium and inner system, they
undoubtedly have other hidden agendas that groups
like Firewall can only guess at.

PROJECT OZMA AND FIREWALL
Though Project Ozma and Firewall often see eye-to-
eye concerning the nature of various threats, they are
more often at odds: wary adversaries, acknowledging
the prowess of the other, but never letting down their
guard. This “at odds” mentality does not stem so much
from the methods used (though most Firewall consider
Project Ozma personnel explosive-happy-puppets that
can’t think their way out of a skin sack) as from
conflicting agendas. Project Ozma does not trust an
organization as powerful as Firewall because it does
not have a rigid enough hierarchy and is outside of any
known authority’s control (namely themselves). Con-
versely, Firewall doesn’t trust Project Ozma as they are
too close to the powerful inner system elites and their
opposition to x-risks is a more incidental side effect of
more self-serving goals.

PROMETHEANS
The Prometheans were the first actual seed AIs cre-
ated by transhumanity (by the Singularity Foundation)
before the Fall. Specifically developed as “friendly”
AIs, the Prometheans are programmed to consider
themselves part of the transhuman family and to act
in transhumanity’s best interests. They played a key
role during the Fall, mitigating the damage inflicted
by the TITANs and even managing to counteract the
Exsurgent virus to a large degree. During these trying
times, numerous Prometheans were destroyed by the
TITANs or infected and subsumed by the Exsurgent
virus. In the aftermath, these seed AIs participated in
the formation of Firewall and continue to back the
organization behind the scenes.
   Wary of falling prey to the Exsurgent virus, most
Prometheans carefully secure themselves in well-
defended and isolated systems. They are also cautious
in their own self-development, not wanting to become
victims of their own rise to super-intelligence. Fear-
ing a potential backlash by a paranoid transhuman-
ity should their existence become known, they hide
their activities behind multiple layers of secrecy. Even
within the ranks of Firewall their existence and sup-
port remain a closely guarded secret.
   Each Promethean is individually distinct with its
own personality, motivations, and goals. Though they
generally work together and support each other, they
have been known to have differences of opinion and
even to sometimes take action against each other. As
extremely potent intelligences, they should also be
treated as distinctly non-human. Even though their
original templates were based on human mindsets,
they have evolved and grown in ways that can only
be described as posthuman.
   Gamemasters are encouraged to keep Promethean
involvement with player characters to a minimum,
though they may occasionally be useful as an ace in
the hole for Firewall. Their existence and involve-
ment can in fact be the basis for an entire adventure,
perhaps leading sentinel characters to wonder exactly
who they are working for. Though, as seed AIs, they
cannot download their full minds into a transhuman
morph, they are capable of making severely dumbed-
down delta forks that they may sleeve into physical
forms. Within the mesh, of course, Prometheans are
nearly unstoppable adversaries, able to rip into secure
networks with ease, though they prefer methods of
covert infiltration rather than direct subversion.



THE TITANS AND THEIR LEGACY
As noted in Secrets That Matter (p. 352), the TITANs
are not quite the bogeyman that they have been made
out to be in the wake of the Fall. However, there is no
saying how the TITANs would have turned out had
they not run afoul of the Exsurgent virus. Designed as
an intelligent netwar system and emerging to their full
capabilities during the conflicts of the Fall, the TITANs
have imperatives for self-improvement, self-protection,
and overcoming opposition hardwired into their pro-
gramming. Unlike the Prometheans, they were not
designed to consider themselves transhuman and to
work in the interests of all of transhumanity, but were
programmed with factionalism from the start. They
also were not socialized with transhuman mindsets
and values as the Prometheans and most AGIs were,
meaning that aside from their programmed military
and defense directives they have adapted most of their
own self-interests. Given this and their recursively-
improved intelligence capabilities, it is likely that the
TITANs are far removed from transhuman interests
and modes of thinking. It’s impossible to say how they
would have interacted with transhumanity if history
had played out differently, but it is unlikely that they
would have considered themselves part of the trans-
human family or even seen fit to remain on friendly/
supportive terms with transhumanity.
   Though the TITANs are believed to have left Earth
at the end of the Fall, no one is quite sure exactly
what happened or why. It is known that the onslaught
of TITAN mesh attacks suddenly broke off in the
wake of transhumanity’s off-planet exodus, and that
the bulk of TITAN activity on Earth and around the
system came to a distinct halt. After the discovery
of the Pandora Gates, it was widely assumed that
the TITANs had constructed these gates and used
them to leave the solar system for distant parts of
the galaxy, presumably taking billions of uploaded
minds with them. While some believe—and hope—
that the TITANs are gone for good, there are others
who worry that they are still here, lingering on Earth
and hidden away in other niches of the solar system,
but in some sort of dormant state, perhaps building
up to some future onslaught. A few believe that the
TITANs are indeed gone, but are concerned that that
their attention was simply temporarily diverted and
that they will one day return to finish the destruction
of transhumanity.
   The truth is that the TITANs did indeed build the
gates and embark for destinations unknown (though
gamemasters may of course decide otherwise for their
games), but this does not mean that they are all gone.
Some still linger in hidden places, perhaps trapped and
wounded during some conflict during the Fall, finish-
ing up some unfathomable task, or driven mad by the
Exsurgent virus and left behind by their fellows. It is
always possible that others may return, most likely
to complete some unfinished job or perhaps to lure
transhumanity out into the galaxy. It is also possible
that transhumans will find traces of the TITANs in
the network of exoplanet gates, perhaps even whole
communities of TITANs, pursuing whatever agendas
they have in the vastness of space.
   As with transhumans, the TITANs are not necessar-
ily unified. They have different agendas and goals and
may very well come into conflict with one another.
Though all have been corrupted and subverted by the
Exsurgent virus, and so they act according to the ETI’s

%%% txt/384.txt
whims, some of them retain aspects of their original
minds and do not always fall in step as quickly as the
others. Gamemasters can use this to their advantage,
creating plots that allow the characters to exploit
differences between the TITANs in order to escape
otherwise deadly or impossible situations.
   In game terms, the TITANs are not given stats.
They are as potent as the gamemaster needs them to
be. Like the Prometheans, the TITANs are incapable
of downloading their full intelligence into physical
morphs, though they may puppeteer morphs or create
limited delta forks for sleeving purposes. Like the Pro-
metheans, they should rarely be used or encountered
directly by the player characters
  While the TITANs may no longer be the direct
threat they once were, they left behind an arsenal of
weapons, nanoswarms, and virii that still linger on
Earth, the Zone on Mars, and various derelict habitats
and deserted places. Characters venturing into such
places may encounter these as a threat or they may
need to work against an outbreak of such dangers in
an inhabited habitat.

DEADLY MACHINES
The TITANs unleashed a number of deadly machines
during the Fall, many of which still seek out transhu-
mans to attack.

FRACTALS
Fractals are advanced bush robots. In their standard
form, fractals resemble a strange sort of metallic
bush surrounded with an eerie glittering haze. In
their center are a number of metallic branches, linked
together with a flexible joint. Each of these branches
splits into two or more smaller branches, also with
flexible joints. These branches also split, and then split
again, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip
of each fractal branch ends in a nanoscale manipula-
tor. Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having
the capability to dismantle almost anything at the
molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm
(p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nano-
fabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is
futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down
into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use
those as components to build a weapon to use back
against you.
   Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the
gamemaster desires—if they don’t have something,
they can make it. Fractals are also able to nanofab-
ricate items much more quickly than transhuman
nanofabricators; reduce all times by half (half an hour
per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as
their “bodies” are actually airy assemblages of fractal
branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off
are caught and absorbed by others. Reduce damage
from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to
the minimum possible damage. Area effect and spray
weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing,
regenerating damage at the rate of 1d10 points per
half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per
hour after all damage is healed.

HEADHUNTERS
Headhunters are multi-legged insectoid flying drones
that use a dragonfly wing configuration to hover and
move. The legs are equipped with grasping claws
and extendable buzzsaws. Their primary purpose is
to grasp on to the heads of victims and cut through
the neck, decapitating them. Collected heads are then
flown to nearby special facilities for forced uploading.

SELF-REPLICATING NANOSWARMS
The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step
beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity.
Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN
swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating.
They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not
single function but can modify themselves to perform
almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-
fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 382).
Combined, these capabilities make such nanoswarms
incredibly potent. When they encounter a new op-
ponent, they can scan the opponent’s capabilities and
then fabricate offensive systems to use against them.
When an opponent deploys a weapon system again the
swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that
will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in
the future. These nanoswarms may also function like
so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical
lattice in order to create large scale physical forms.
   The possibilities for such nanoswarms are almost lim-
itless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible
nanoscopic swarm, float as barely-visible mist, or shape
into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about.
When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform
itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground,
shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or
link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to
slice through their fleshy foes. Such nanoswarms are
also impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need
to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new
swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.
   Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given
for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the
following additions and exceptions:

  • They do not need to be sustained by a hive and
    do not deteriorate.
  • They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per
    half hour.
  • They may nanofabricate new items, materials,
    or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an
    hour per Cost category).
  • They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func-
    tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions
    of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust,
    covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).
  • They may make SOM Tests.
  • At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may adapt
    new defenses against attacks used against them.
    New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise
    and replicate throughout the swarm, after which
    such an attack will inflict minimal or no damage.
  • Assume they have any skill they need at a mini-
    mum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve
    as needed.

NANOVIRII
The TITANs unleashed a number of biowar plagues
during the Fall. Similar to the exsurgent virus, these
were spread as biological nanovirii (p. 363) or nano-
swarm plagues (p. 364)—use the same rules for deter-
mining exposure and infection.

MELDER
This virus slowly breaks down the target’s body,
converting the biological materials into some sort of
biofilament that then meshes with implants, electron-
ics, and physical objects and structures. In effect, the
biological and synthetic are melded together, continu-
ing to expand and grow, consuming anything around
them into their growth. Victims suffer 1d10 DV and
1d10 SV every hour, implants become inoperable after
2 hours, and the target becomes fully transformed
and absorbed into the new melding substance after
12 hours.

METASTASIZER
This sophisticated smart protein massively reprograms
the target’s cells to go rapidly, autocannibalistically
cancerous. After 2 + (SOM ÷ 10, round up) hours, the
target suffers death by dozens of supercancers.

NECROTIZER
This virus breaks down the target’s cells into their
component proteins. Reduce the target’s aptitudes by
5 per hour as they slowly convert into a puddle of
sludge. The character dies if any aptitude reaches 0.

NEUROPATHS
These virii target the victim’s neurological system,
often rewriting portions of it to inflict some type of
permanent neurological damage. After 12 hours, this
virus inflicts the Neural Damage trait (p. 150).

PETRIFIER
The petrifier virus transforms the target’s cells into
a simple molecular compound or element—typically
carbon or crystal. The target suffers 1d10 DV and –5
to all aptitudes per hour, dying when any aptitudes
reach 0. Victims are frozen in place, converted into an
nonliving statue.

UZUMAKI
The target of this virus begins suffering from bizarre
fleshy growths. After four hours, their body literally
erupts with meaty “vines” or “tentacles” that warp
into spiral patterns. This process inflicts 1d10 DV and
1d10 SV per hour to the victim until they eventually
transform into an unworldly expanse of fleshy growth.
In many cases, growth has continued long after a
character’s death, creating expansive carpets and vines
of skin and blood vessels, like some sort of bizarre
meat plant.
GAMEMASTERING
AND ADMINISTRATION
The following advice will assist gamemasters in run-
ning their games more efficiently.

AWARDING REZ POINTS
In Eclipse Phase, characters earn Rez Points in order
to advance (see Character Advancement, p. 152). As
the name suggests, these points are awarded so players
can spend them to better define their characters—to
bring them into higher resolution, sharper focus. As
the gamemaster, you determine when and how many
Rez Points to award, following the guidelines below.
   Rez Points should be awarded at the end of every
story arc, at the break in the action between one ad-
venture and the next. Depending on your style of play
and the length of your sessions, this should roughly be
every 3–6 gaming sessions. If a scenario goes shorter
or longer, the Rez Point awards should be adjusted
accordingly. In the case of long-term campaigns, the
gamemaster should break down the action into digest-
ible chunks, or “chapters,” and assign Rez Points after
each such segment.
  Every character should be awarded 1 Rez Point for
each of the following criteria that is met:

 • The character participated in that scenario.
 • The character achieved (most of) their objectives
   in that scenario.
 • The character failed to meet their objectives, but
   learned a valuable lesson.
 • The character contributed to achieving success
   in a significant way (e.g., right skill at the right
   time).
 • The adventure was extra challenging.
 • The character achieved a motivational goal (see
   Motivation, p. 120).
 • The player engaged in good roleplaying.
 • The player significantly contributed to the ses-
   sion’s drama, humor, or fun with roleplaying.

  This should result in an average Rez Points award
of 4–7 points per character, per adventure. Game-
masters who wish to drive the characters’ advance-
ment forward more quickly can increase the reward
amounts.

REPUTATION GAIN AND LOSS
In addition to awarding Rez Points, the gamemaster
should also adjust each character’s Rep scores accord-
ing to actions they took during game play, according to
the guidelines below. For simplicity, these can be applied
at the end of the adventure, though gamemasters who
seek a more dynamic game could apply changes to the
characters’ Rep scores in game, as their peers judge
them according to their actions (or lack thereof) and
news about them in real time. Rep scores should only
be modified according to public actions and interactions

%%% txt/387.txt
the character has with people capable of pinging their
Rep with positive or negative feedback. Actions that
happen in secret, without anyone ever knowing, should
have no effect. Likewise, pissing off a Factor or a brinker
isolate who never communicates with outsiders isn’t
going to matter because no one else will ever hear of it
(unless the character lifelogs it and posts it to the mesh
later ... ). Note that Rep modifications only apply to Rep
scores tied to the character’s known identity.
   Note that characters may gain and lose Rep score
in networks they don’t actively participate in. For
example, a character with r-rep of 0 may help bring
out a major scientific discovery that is shared with the
solar system’s scientific community at large, thus gain-
ing the character a few points of r-rep even though
they never hang out with argonauts or scientists—
what matters is that people who access r-rep will find
positive details when they ping the person’s score on
that particular rep network.
   Certain actions may result in a character simulta-
neously gaining Rep with one network while losing
Rep in another. For example, an anarchist prankster
who embarrasses a major hypercorp figure in public
will certainly gain some @-rep points, but their c-rep
is likely to go down by an equal amount.
   Rep changes provide an excellent way for gamemas-
ters to include more roleplaying and more interactions
with the Eclipse Phase universe in their games. Social
networks are a two-way street, meaning that members
of the character’s social networks might contact them
for equipment, favors, and information during game
play for things that are completely unrelated to the
mission the character is on. A character who ignores
such requests risks losing Rep. Fulfilling such requests
may gain the character Rep and may also provide
comic relief or even plant some plot hooks for the
next scenario.

REPUTATION GAINS
Rep awards are given for characters who help people
out, benefit a faction, do something creative, make
a major discovery or strides in a particular area of
activity, pull off successful publicity stunts, win a
competition, and so on. Some suggested examples are
noted here:
   Trivial Award (1–2 points): Do a Level 1 favor,
make a moderate contribution to free/open source
projects, throw a good party, make your sales quota,
do the job no one else wants to do.
   Minor Award (3–4 points): Do a Level 2 favor, de-
liver a kick-ass or moving performance, make a minor
contribution to science, win impressively at some
public event.
   Moderate Award (5–6 points): Do a Level 3 favor,
make a serious business score, lead the winning side
in a decisive engagement, create the meme everyone
talks about for a week and then forgets, make the
news for something positive, risk serious injury.
   Major Award (7–8 points): Do a Level 4 favor,
design the new tool everyone wants, throw an
impressive planetoid-scale event, complete an exten-
sive project (1 month work or 1 week of difficult/
specialized work), risk death.
   Extreme Award (9–10 points): Do a Level 5 favor,
start this year’s hot fashion trend, make a major scien-
tific discovery, close the deal on a major corporate ac-
quisition, start (or put down) a revolution, complete
a major project (1 year work or 1 month difficult/
specialized work), risk true death.

REPUTATION LOSSES
Rep losses are suffered by characters who fail to render
aid when needed, lose professional credibility, make
major or public blunders, doublecross their friends,
and so on. Some suggested examples are noted here:
   Trivial Loss (–1 or –2 points): Fail to do a Level 1
favor, inconvenience others, be involved in profession-
al dispute, ruin someone’s day, never are available.
   Minor Loss (–3 or –4 points): Fail to do a Level 2
favor, embarrass yourself at a public event, piss off
somebody important.
   Moderate Loss (–5 or –6 points): Fail to do a Level
3 favor, endanger someone’s physical safety, make
the news for something negative, ruin an event for
everybody.
   Major Loss (–7 or –8 points): Fail to do a Level 4
favor, screw up a major mission or activity, endanger
someone’s life, associate with hated rivals.
   Extreme Loss (–9 or –10 points): Fail to do a Level
5 favor, botch a major mission or activity spectacularly,
betray a faction to its rivals or enemies.

BACKUPS, RECORD-KEEPING,
AND SAVE POINTS
Thanks to cortical stacks and archived backups, char-
acters in Eclipse Phase can recover from death. When
restoring a character from an earlier backup, however,
it is important to be able to know what the state of
the character was as of that backup. Any Rez Points
gained or spent, any character advancements made,
any key information or memories acquired since that
backup was made are lost. This means that in terms of
game stats, resorting to an old backup can mean loss
of a character’s hard-earned advancements—that’s the
trade-off for being effectively immortal.
   Since these changes can have a serious effect on
game play, it’s important to conduct accurate record-
keeping. This sort of bookkeeping isn’t hard, and
there are two ways to do it. The first is to simply
make a copy of a the character’s record sheet any
time a character makes an archived backup, forks off
an alpha or beta copy, or dies (thus freezing the corti-
cal stack backup). Each of these is considered a “save
point.” In this case, carefully note the date and time
(both in character and out of character), and what
the event was that prompted the backup. Since what
knowledge a character knows at different points in
their life may be important, you may also want to
note what important information they may hold in
their head, as well as what the recent events in their

%%% txt/388.txt
NPCS AND MOXIE
When a gamemaster is generating or wing-
ing NPCs that the characters interact or fight
with, the question of Moxie for NPCs must be
addressed. When it comes to run-of-the-mill
grunt NPC characters, we recommend that such
NPCs don’t be given Moxie. The reasons for this
are simple. For one, it is one less stat/headache
for the gamemaster to keep track of. More im-
portantly, however, it represents the edge that
player characters have over the nameless mooks
they encounter. When it comes to major NPCs,
however—prime antagonists, key allies, etc.—
these characters should have their own Moxie
score. Because such NPCs play pivotal roles in a
scenario, it is important for them to be able to
alter the outcome of events in much the same
way the player characters can. It also allows a
gamemaster to counteract an unfortunate roll
of the dice that might otherwise spoil the big
climax you have worked so hard to set up.       ■



 life were (to help jog your memory later). This way,
 if the character ever reverts back to one of these save
 points, you have notes not only on their character
 stats, but what they remember.
    Alternately, you can keep a log of all of your
 character’s developments, noted by in-character
 date. These developments would include: Rez Points
 spent or earned, character advancements made, key
 information acquired, backups made, alpha or beta
 forks made, and so on. In this case, if the character
 dies and reverts back to an earlier backup, it is easy
 to see what changes need to be “rolled back” to get
 back to that previous version of the character. When
 alpha and beta forks are made, you may also want to
 branch off a separate log for each fork, as their life
 stream may develop differently than from the original
 character they were spun off from.

  GAMEMASTERING PRACTICALITIES
 Eclipse Phase is a game about a dark future in which
 the meaning of (trans)humanity and its very survival
 are at stake. In practice, however, your campaign can
 take on a wide assortment of flavors or even mix
 several styles together. There’s nothing that says you
 have to play Eclipse Phase specifically according to
 the guidelines we set out. This section covers topics
 you should think about while preparing a campaign
 and running it, to help you do things the way that
 makes you and your players happiest.

  GAMEMASTER RESPONSIBILITIES
 The gamemaster has certain responsibilities that will
 keep a game flowing smoothly. The following is a
 short summary of the basics.
  • The gamemaster should be familiar with the
    whole game. This doesn’t mean the rulebook
    must be memorized. An understanding of the core
    mechanics is a must, however, as well as knowing
    where to find other rules quickly, as needed.
  • The gamemaster should have solid notes on the
    plots and subplots created for each session. Noth-
    ing will ensure you prepare better next time like
    having the players catch you in a major continu-
    ity error due to lack of notes.
  • The gamemaster doesn’t just set the scene, they
    play all the non-player characters that populate
    the universe. Making each NPC convincing, while
    not messing up a plot or losing the thread of a
    scene, can be difficult. Notes are your friend.
  • Know when it’s time to toss the dice and trust
    to the game mechanics to resolve a situation and
    when it’s better to ride out a situation through
    storytelling and dialog. This is an acquired skill.
    The more practice you have, the better you’ll get.
  • Don’t cheat. Your NPCs should not have access
    to information they’ve not gained during game
    play. If you roll terribly for your major antago-
    nist at the height of the story and they fall with
    a whimper, roll with it. Be flexible and improvise
    in such situations. Your players are smart and
    perceptive and will know when you’re forcing
    a situation with unfair tactics. At the same time,
    they’ll also know when you’ve stepped up and
    run with the flow—and they’ll thank you for it.

FUNDAMENTALS
It’s possible to stumble into a campaign without ever
really making an effort to find out what everyone
wants, shooting into the darkness and happening to
score a bullseye, but it’s not a very reliable way to go.
Successful campaigns usually begin with communica-
tion. As you begin to prepare your campaign, talk to
your players. Explain the basics of the Eclipse Phase
setting and let them look over the options for charac-
ters and tell you what they find interesting. Also take
note of what they find uninteresting or even repellent,
so that nobody wastes a lot of time getting set for op-
tions that simply won’t be enjoyable in play.

CHALLENGES TO PLAYERS
Eclipse Phase is set in a time of catastrophic troubles
and looming disasters, and it’s full of facts and con-
cepts that may be heady or even uncomfortable to
some players—not to mention their characters. One of
the fundamental questions for each gaming group is,
how much challenge to the players’ sense of comfort is
a good idea? There is no single answer, because tastes
vary. There are groups whose players thrive on a diet
of culture shock, ideological disorientation, gray areas,
and difficult ethical choices. They love the moral and
intellectual battleground gaming can provide, and
are seldom so happy as when confronted with a
really hard, really interesting dilemma. There are also
groups whose players thrive on a diet of intellectual

%%% txt/389.txt
engagement, tactical and strategic challenge, and well-
developed roleplaying that never pushes players’
buttons or puts them into harsh no-win situations.
There’s a whole universe of responses in between these
style sof play and none of them can conceivably be
right for everyone. What matters to your campaign is
what works for you and your players.
   Keep in mind as you talk about it with your group
that more shock doesn’t equal more maturity. The
prime audience for gore in film, for instance, is not
well-aged men and women but teenage boys and
young men. Shakespeare’s The Tempest is no less
mature a tale than Macbeth even though it has a
happy ending. It can be easy to confuse endurance
with enlightenment, but in fact the two have nothing
to do with each other. Endurance is about how much
description of visceral nastiness the players can take
(and deliver), while enlightenment (insofar as it ever
happens in gaming) is about what insights players
take away from whatever it is that happened in play.
Don’t feel like a wimpy failure if you or your players
would rather keep the darker parts of the game world
suggested rather than delineated in hard-edged detail,
since the point is that it be satisfying rather than it
be as horrifying or mind-blowing as possible. The
converse is also true: just as more is not better, so less
is not better if your players do thrive on details. Your
job as gamemaster includes knowing as much as you
can about what it is your players actually prefer in
this regard as in others and seeing how you can satisfy
it in ways that are also satisfying for you.
   That said, there is one technique you really should
never use without very clear permission from your
players, and that’s playing on their real-world fears
and phobias. If you know that one of them is, for
instance, genuinely phobic about spiders, you can
count on getting some real shivers by adding arachnid
features to robots and morphs. You can also ruin a
player’s enjoyment of the session or the whole cam-
paign that way, if it comes unexpectedly and leads
to the real-world fear drowning out the experience
of play. Some players are fine with judicious use of
their vulnerabilities, and others just aren’t. Under no
circumstances should you poke at weak spots without
making sure you’ve discussed it first.
THE PROBLEM OF SECRETS
Uncovering secrets is a big part of this game. There’s
a problem, however, in that a lot of the secrets are out
there where players can come across them: in this very
chapter, in reviews of the game, discussion in online
forums, and so on. As gamemaster, you will need to
decide how you want to deal with the potential for
spoiled revelations.
   As with so many potential issues, the place to start
is with your players. Ask them how much it bothers
them to know things that their characters are going
to be finding out in play. Some players do a fine job
separating their own knowledge from that of their
characters with mental firewalls. Others have a very
difficult time doing so, and knowing things in advance
as players takes away a lot of the fun of character
discovery for them. In addition, some players have
a good sense of what degree of player-level surprise
works best for them, and some don’t. Discuss it with
them. Tell them that spoilers are available, and that
you certainly can’t stop them from learning it all, one
way or another. Ask them how much trouble this may
be for them, and then proceed from there. Ask the
players who have more trouble with spoilers to simply
stay away from early commentary on the game, and
tell them that you’ll let them know when the spoilers
have come into play in your own campaign so that
it’s no longer an issue. Ask the other players to work
with you in keeping things fresh and fun for those
players, too. In most groups, making it a matter of
cooperation for the sake of everyone’s good time will
draw out good responses. (If it doesn’t, the group may
well have other problems in any event.)
   There’s a related question for both you and your
players. How much do any of you mind when a par-
ticular campaign’s version of an answer diverges from
the stock one provided in print? There are two kinds
of variation possible for this, and each one raises its
own issues.
   There are matters that the game leaves unresolved,
so that there is no single authoritative answer, like the
number of TITANs in the solar system in the game’s
present moment. If you choose to give a specific
number, it’s your choice, and any number that seems
to work for your campaign will probably do the job,

%%% txt/390.txt
whether it’s one, three, seven, a dozen, or something
else. Your campaign can’t diverge from the baseline
unless your answer is relatively extreme, like “there
are no TITANs, it was all a hoax before contact with
the Exsurgent virus and then purely alien technology
after that.” In this case, your players can have read
all the game’s secrets and still be surprised by the rev-
elation you present. The potential for trouble here is
not a conflict of expectations based on the game, but
based on expectations raised in other contexts. Some
games, like some movies, TV shows, and other stories,
develop a following with strong ideas of its own about
what the real truths and important matters are, and if
the following thrives, its members may end up with
ideas that have less and less to do with the original
inspiration. This isn’t good or bad in itself, but it can
be a problem, which is why it bears conscious consid-
eration and discussion, both before play and as the
campaign evolves. Ask your players to tell you about
conversations and insights that shape their expecta-
tions for the game world and storylines. Sometimes
you’ll want to work those in with your own plans,
sometimes you may want to deliberately play against
them for the sake of a delightful surprise (generally
more delightful for players than characters, but that’s
life as a character for you). In either case, it’s better to
be thinking about it than missing it.
   Then there are matters that the game does give
definite answers for, but which you wish to change
for the sake of your own campaign’s characters and
stories. This is perfectly fine. There are no game police
roaming the countryside and forcing you to accept
answers you’d prefer not to use. But your players
will, as with the first question, have expectations, and
your campaign will work better if you make sure you
understand what those expectations are. How much
would it bother them if it turned out there were no
TITANs and it was all a hoax, and so on? It’s hard to
guess what friends will say and impossible to predict
the range of responses strangers might give, so ask
them. (This particular answer is one that’s unlikely to
appear in anyone’s campaign, but it makes a handy
example for your conversational use precisely because
it’s extreme. So their answers to it are likely to be
about the same as to any other potentially extreme
change, and this one probably doesn’t give away any
of your own plans.) Some players are flexible on most
matters but have particular points of attachment;
if yours are among them, ask them to explain what
those points are for them, so that you can keep them
in mind. Other players have a hard time having fun
with any major shift from published standard answers,
and if you have players like that, you’ll want to know
it so that you can see how to adapt your plans to
work within that framework.
THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT:
SHARED INSPIRATION
It’s not quite true that everything changed from the
early 21st century to Eclipse Phase’s universe, but a
great many things did, and it can be hard to keep track
of them all at once. This is where shared inspirations
can come in handy. One striking illustration can convey
a lot of details for both foreground and background,
suggesting an aesthetic standard for design, an exotic
environment, people doing futuristic tasks with appro-
priately advanced tools, and so on. A prose passage
from a rewarding novel may set an ambiance or nail
down some aspect of the characters’ circumstances.
   There are potential pitfalls, and it’s important to
be aware of them. The greatest is obsolescence, the
meaning of something evocative changing because
the players’ reality has changed since the inspiration
entered it. William Gibson’s ground-breaking cyber-
punk novel Neuromancer begins, “The sky above the
port was the color of television, tuned to a dead chan-
nel.” Supporting details make it clear that this is an
industrial port at night, the sky gray from pollution
and flecked with ash and other debris. But that was
an image published in 1984. A decade and a half later,
Neil Gaiman pointed out that to his children, the
color of television tuned to a dead channel is bright
blue, thanks to ubiquitous cable delivery. In another
decade, the default color of a station not in use may
be something else entirely. The moral is that it’s not
enough to agree that an image is very striking. You’ll
want to make sure that you all agree on what it is
about it that’s striking, to avoid a tangle of miscon-
ceptions that could derail play later on.
   The References page (p. 394) offers a wide range
of immediately relevant inspirations, but it’s not the
final word on the subject. If the people in your group
have a long-time favorite space scene, or description
of life in the midst of a high-tech investigation, or
poetic glimpse of what it might feel like to modify the
body in ways not possible in real life, or something
else that’s stayed with them a long time and seems
like it might bear on your campaign, encourage them
to share. Remember to be courteous with each other’s
personal treasures, whether you end up using them
or not; there’s nothing like earned trust to encourage
more sharing.
   Images can be particularly helpful for what they
convey about the world behind and around the
foreground events. For instance, think of a corridor
on a typical spaceship or habitat in Eclipse Phase.
Did you imagine it as being a standardized size and
shape, so that its counterparts elsewhere would be
very much the same or a more individualized work
intended for use just where it is without concern
for interchangeability? Did you imagine it as well
lit even when not in use, lit well when sensors show
people present and otherwise dim or dark, or perhaps
planned to be well lit but in practice haphazard and
unreliable thanks to lack of maintenance and funds?
Did you imagine its surfaces smooth and clean, with

%%% txt/391.txt
equipment, maintenance bays, and the like all behind
hatches and covers, or was it cluttered and lumpy?
None of that matters all the time, but when it comes
to the investigation of a derelict, the hunt for someone
(or something) trying to hide, a race against time, or
other dramatic complication, these things could affect
your play, and rather than try to tally all possible con-
tingencies in advance, having some general-purpose
references can save everyone time and confusion.

THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE: HORROR
The universe of Eclipse Phase is a time of horrors
unleashed. Every character has had to come to some
personal accommodation with the existence of things
that offend our basic expectations of decency and
practicality all at once. Horror comes in many flavors,
and no one campaign can make use of all of them.
   There are at least as many theories of horror as
there are people who create horror stories. Everything
here is necessarily a generalization. You and your
players can find exceptions to every single point in
it, and if you like the way those work better, go with
them. This discussion is intended to trigger ideas, not
to close off anything. That said, there are some useful
generalizations about horror, starting with an insight
expressed well by H.P. Lovecraft: “The oldest and
strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest
and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.” All
horror can be thought of as built around encounters
with the unknown, beginning with the realization that
there is something unknown present, learning some-
thing about the scope of its nature and activities, and
then trying to respond one way or another.
   In this game, the discovery part is half over. There’s
no question about the presence of the unknown.
Yes, there really are monsters beyond transhuman
understanding loose in the universe, and everyone in
the Eclipse Phase universe knows how bad and how
strange the TITANs could get. Many people also have
some idea of how exotic life on the far side of the Pan-
dora Gates can be. There’s no room left for characters
to respond to some new strangeness with confident
skepticism, sure that they know the range of what’s
possible and plausible within transhuman experience
anymore. Almost anything might exist, given the
facts of what’s already known. Instead, the question
for Eclipse Phase people facing a mystery is whether
this particular unknown will turn out to be simple
and straightforward to deal with, more complicated
but nonetheless a part of their routine lives like mal-
functioning machinery or a sabotaged and unusually
modified morph, or something beyond the normal like
a TITAN-programmed weapon or alien life. Sooner or
later, if they keep poking around, the characters can
count on running into all sorts of unknown and maybe
even unknowable challenges. Are they there yet?
   Horror is seldom very far from humor. Humor
serves many roles in human psychology, and one of
them is helping us whittle down the mental “size” of
mysteries and threats to something we can deal with.
 Furthermore, horror usually involves a balance of im-
 probable elements, with things lined up to go wrong
 in interesting ways, and it doesn’t take much for a
 particular rickety edifice to go from strange and men-
 acing to ludicrous. When your players start laughing,
 sometimes the best thing for you to do is to roll with
 it. Laughter can do everyone good, supporting the
“play” part of roleplaying. In addition, some events
 actually are funny or at least can be taken as funny,
 even (sometimes especially) when most of what’s going
 on is serious. On the other hand, if you really would
 like to keep a scene serious and the players break out
 in giggles, it’s often wise to go ahead and take a break.
Tell the players what you’re doing, too; trying to de-
 ceive a group of your friends isn’t very reliable and
 can backfire badly. Make the break long enough for
 everyone to get the giggles out and then continue.
    At the end of the day, through communication with
 their players, the gamemaster will know how much
 horror their group wishes to encounter. A group may
 decide that they want to be 100 percent immersed
 into the various horrors of Eclipse Phase. Another
 group, however, may decide that while they enjoy
 the meshed theme of horror with the other aspects
 of Eclipse Phase, they don’t wish it to be a principal
 element. In such a situation, horror would remain just
 that, a theme, while the plots woven by the gamemas-
 ter would spin around the myriad of other elements
 that make up the game.

TRANSHUMANISM
Humanity has embraced transhumanism for survival,
harnessing science and technologies to catapult physi-
cal and mental faculties to super-human levels, while
eradicating involuntary death and enabling near im-
mortality through the digitization of consciousness
and the ability to transfer bodies at will. This is one of
the cornerstone themes of Eclipse Phase.
  The technologies inherent to a transhuman future
raise many questions and ethical issues, however, and
these are some of the central themes that Eclipse
Phase seeks to explore. We encourage both gamemas-
ter and players to play around with the possibilities
and contradictions enabled in such a universe. How
do our mindsets change when death no longer looms
over us? What does identity mean when our bodies
are disposable and our personalities can be edited?
Are we the same person when we are revived from
a backup, or sent off as a fork? Are technologies like
nanofabrication something to be feared and restricted,
even when they can eliminate poverty and greed?
How do we ensure public safety in a world where
technology makes weapons of mass destruction easily
available? How do ideas inherent to religious and
spiritual thought cope with AI, backups, or resleev-
ing? What does it mean to be an uplifted animal in a
society centered on humans? Who decides our future?
These are just a few of the issues that Eclipse Phase
raises, and many of them can be used as the central
theme for an entire campaign.
